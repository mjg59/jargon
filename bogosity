 :bogosity: /boh·go´s@·tee/, n. 1. [orig. CMU, now very common] The degree to
which something is {bogus}. Bogosity is measured with a {bogometer}; in a
seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand
and say "My bogometer just triggered". More extremely, "You just pinned my
bogometer" means you just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it
is off the scale, pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible
reading (one might also say "You just redlined my bogometer"). The
agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the {microLenat}. 2. The potential field
generated by a {bogon flux}; see {quantum bogodynamics}. see also {bogon
flux}, {bogon filter}, {bogus}.
