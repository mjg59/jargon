 :bogosity: /boh-go's*-tee/ n. 1. The degree to which something is {bogus}.
At CMU, bogosity is measured with a {bogometer}; in a seminar, when a speaker
says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say "My bogometer
just triggered". More extremely, "You just pinned my bogometer" means you
just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it is off the scale,
pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible reading (one might also
say "You just redlined my bogometer"). The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is
the microLenat /mi:k`roh-len'*t/ (uL); the consensus is that this is the
largest unit practical for everyday use. 2. The potential field generated by
a {bogon flux}; see {quantum bogodynamics}. see also {bogon flux}, {bogon
filter}, {bogus}. Historical note: The microLenat was invented as an attack
against noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a {tenured graduate student}.
Doug had failed the student on an important exam for giving only "AI is
bogus" as his answer to the questions. The slur is generally considered
unmerited, but it has become a running gag nevertheless. Some of Doug's
friends argue that *of course* a microLenat is bogus, since it is only one
millionth of a Lenat. Others have suggested that the unit should be
redesignated after the grad student, as the microReid.
