 BOGOSITY /boh-go's@-tee/ n. 1. The degree to which something is BOGUS
(q.v.). At CMU, bogosity is measured with a BOGOMETER; typical use: in a
seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand
and say, "My bogometer just triggered." The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is
the microLenat (uL). 2. The potential field generated by a bogon flux; see
QUANTUM BOGODYNAMICS.
