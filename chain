 :chain: 1. vi. [orig. from BASIC's `CHAIN' statement] To hand off execution
to a child or successor without going through the {OS} command interpreter
that invoked it. The state of the parent program is lost and there is no
returning to it. Though this facility used to be common on memory-limited
micros and is still widely supported for backward compatibility, the jargon
usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most Unix programmers will think of
this as an {exec}. Oppose the more modern `subshell'. 2. n. A series of
linked data areas within an operating system or application. `Chain rattling'
is the process of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching
for one which is of interest to the executing program. The implication is
that there is a very large number of links on the chain.
