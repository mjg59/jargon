 CHAIN [orig. from BASIC's CHAIN statement] vi. When used of programming
languages, refers to a statement that allows a parent executable to hand off
execution to a child without going through the OS command interpreter. The
state of the parent program is lost and there is no returning to it. Though
this facility used to be common on memory-limited micros and is still widely
supported for backward compatibility, the jargon usage is semi-obsolescent;
in particular most UNIX programmers will think of this as an EXEC. Oppose the
more modern SUBSHELL.
