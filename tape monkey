 :tape monkey: n. A junior system administrator, one who might plausibly be
assigned to do physical swapping of tapes and subsequent storage. When a
backup needs to be restored, one might holler "Tape monkey!" (Compare
{one-banana problem}) Also used to dismiss jobs not worthy of a highly
trained sysadmin's ineffable talents: "Cable up her PC? You must be joking -
I'm no tape monkey."
