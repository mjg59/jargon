 :elevator controller: /n./ An archetypal dumb embedded-systems application,
like {toaster} (which superseded it). During one period (1983--84) in the
deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C standardization committee) this was the
canonical example of a really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.
"You can't require `printf(3)' to be part of the default runtime library --
what if you're targeting an elevator controller?" Elevator controllers became
important rhetorical weapons on both sides of several {holy wars}.
