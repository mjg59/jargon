 :film at 11: [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in conversation to
announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic implication that these events are
earth-shattering. "{{ITS}} crashes; film at 11." "Bug found in scheduler;
film at 11." 2. Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional
information will be available at some future time, *without* the implication
of anything particularly ordinary about the referenced event. For example,
"The mail file server died this morning; we found garbage all over the root
directory. Film at 11." would indicate that a major failure had occurred but
the people working on it have no additional information about it. Use of the
phrase in this way suggests gently that people would appreciate it if users
would quit bothering them and wait for the 11:00 news for additional
information.
