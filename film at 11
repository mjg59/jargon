 FILM AT 11 (film at @-lev'n) [MIT, in imitation of TV network news squibs.],
interj. Used in conversation to announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic
implication that these events are earth-shattering. This is hard to describe.
Examples: "ITS crashes; film at 11." "Bug found in scheduler; film at 11."
