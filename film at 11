 :film at 11: [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in conversation to
announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic implication that these events are
earth-shattering. "{ITS} crashes; film at 11." "Bug found in scheduler; film
at 11." 2. Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that additional
information will be available at some future time, without the implication of
anything particularly ordinary about the referenced event. For example, "The
mail file server died this morning; we found garbage all over the root
directory. Film at 11." would indicate that a major failure had occurred but
that the people working on it have no additional information about it as yet;
use of the phrase in this way suggests gently that the problem is liable to
be fixed more quickly if the people doing the fixing can spend time doing the
fixing rather than responding to questions, the answers to which will appear
on the normal "11:00 news", if people will just be patient. The variant
"MPEGs at 11" has recently been cited (MPEG is a digital-video format.)
