 :happily: /adv./ Of software, used to emphasize that a program is unaware of
some important fact about its environment, either because it has been fooled
into believing a lie, or because it doesn't care. The sense of `happy' here
is not that of elation, but rather that of blissful ignorance. "The program
continues to run, happily unaware that its output is going to /dev/null."
Also used to suggest that a program or device would really rather be doing
something destructive, and is being given an opportunity to do so. "If you
enter an O here instead of a zero, the program will happily erase all your
data."
