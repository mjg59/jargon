 :happily: adv. Of software, used to emphasize that a program is unaware of
some important fact about its environment, either because it has been fooled
into believing a lie, or because it doesn't care. The sense of `happy' here
is not that of elation, but rather that of blissful ignorance. "The program
continues to run, happily unaware that its output is going to /dev/null."
