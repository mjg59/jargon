 :epsilon: [see {delta}] 1. /n./ A small quantity of anything. "The cost is
epsilon." 2. /adj./ Very small, negligible; less than {marginal}. "We can get
this feature for epsilon cost." 3. `within epsilon of': close enough to be
indistinguishable for all practical purposes, even closer than being `within
delta of'. "That's not what I asked for, but it's within epsilon of what I
wanted." Alternatively, it may mean not close enough, but very little is
required to get it there: "My program is within epsilon of working."
