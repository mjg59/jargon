 EPSILON [from standard mathematical notation for a small quantity] 1. n. A
small quantity of anything. "The cost is epsilon." 2. adj. Very small,
negligible; less than marginal. "We can get this feature for epsilon cost."
3. WITHIN EPSILON OF: Close enough to be indistinguishable for all practical
purposes. This is even closer than being WITHIN DELTA OF. Example: "That's
not what I asked for, but it's within epsilon of what I wanted."
Alternatively, it may mean not close enough, but very little is required to
get it there: "My program is within epsilon of working." see ASYMPTOTIC.
