 :frob: /frob/ 1. n. [MIT; very common] The {TMRC} definition was "FROB = a
protruding arm or trunnion"; by metaphoric extension, a `frob' is any random
small thing; an object that you can comfortably hold in one hand; something
you can frob (sense 2). see {frobnitz}. 2. vt. Abbreviated form of
{frobnicate}. 3. [from the {MUD} world] A command on some MUDs that changes a
player's experience level (this can be used to make wizards); also, to
request {wizard} privileges on the `professional courtesy' grounds that one
is a wizard elsewhere. The command is actually `frobnicate' but is
universally abbreviated to the shorter form.
