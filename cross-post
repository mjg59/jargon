 :cross-post: vi. [Usenet; very common] To post a single article
simultaneously to several newsgroups. Distinguished from posting the article
repeatedly, once to each newsgroup, which causes people to see it multiple
times (which is very bad form). Gratuitous cross-posting without a
Followup-To line directing responses to a single followup group is frowned
upon, as it tends to cause {followup} articles to go to inappropriate
newsgroups when people respond to only one copy of the original posting.
