 :gweep: /gweep/ [WPI] 1. v. To {hack}, usually at night. At WPI, from 1975
onwards, one who gweeped could often be found at the College Computing Center
punching cards or crashing the {PDP-10} or, later, the DEC-20. A
correspondent who was there at the time opines that the term was originally
onomatopoetic, describing the keyclick sound of the Datapoint terminals long
connected to the PDP-10; others allege that `gweep' was the sound of the
Datapoint's bell (compare {feep}). The term has survived the demise of those
technologies, however, and was still alive in early 1999. "I'm going to go
gweep for a while. see you in the morning." "I gweep from 8 PM till 3 AM
during the week." 2. n. One who habitually gweeps in sense 1; a {hacker}.
"He's a hard-core gweep, mumbles code in his sleep." Around 1979 this was
considered derogatory and not used in self-reference; it has since been
proudly claimed in much the same way as {geek}. = H = =====
