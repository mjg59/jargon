 :optimism: n. What a programmer is full of after fixing the last bug and
before discovering the *next* last bug. Fred Brooks's book "The Mythical
Man-Month" (see "Brooks's Law") contains the following paragraph that
describes this extremely well: All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this
modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and
fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all
but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that
computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always
optimists. But however the selection process works, the result is
indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last
bug.". see also {Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology}.
