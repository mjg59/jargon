 RARE [UNIX] adj. CBREAK mode (character-by-character with interrupts
enabled). Distinguished from `raw' and `cooked', but unlike them this term is
strictly a creature of folklore, not found in the manuals (though it is
alleged that some versions of the V7 manuals used the term `half-cooked').
Usage: rare.
