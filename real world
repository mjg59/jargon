 :Real World: /n./ 1. Those institutions at which `programming' may be used
in the same sentence as `FORTRAN', `{COBOL}', `RPG', `{IBM}', `DBASE', etc.
Places where programs do such commercially necessary but intellectually
uninspiring things as generating payroll checks and invoices. 2. The location
of non-programmers and activities not related to programming. 3. A bizarre
dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and in which a
person's working hours are defined as 9 to 5 (see {code grinder}). 4.
Anywhere outside a university. "Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into the
Real World." Used pejoratively by those not in residence there. In
conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike
speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on the campus of
Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted lamp-post which
bears the label `REALITY CHECKPOINT'. It marks the boundary between
university and the Real World; check your notions of reality before passing.
This joke is funnier because the Cambridge `campus' is actually coextensive
with the center of Cambridge town. see also {fear and loathing}, {mundane},
and {uninteresting}.
