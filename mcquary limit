 :McQuary limit: 4 lines of at most 80 characters each, sometimes still cited
on Usenet as the maximum acceptable size of a {sig block}. Before the great
bandwidth explosion of the early 1990s, long sigs actually cost people
running Usenet servers significant amounts of money. Nowadays social pressure
against long sigs is intended to avoid waste of human attention rather than
machine bandwidth. Accordingly, the McQuary limit should be considered a rule
of thumb rather than a hard limit; it's best to avoid sigs that are large,
repetitive, and distracting. see also {warlording}.
