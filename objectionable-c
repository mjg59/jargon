 :Objectionable-C: n. Hackish take on "Objective-C", the name of an
object-oriented dialect of C in competition with the better-known C++ (it is
used to write native applications on the NeXT machine). Objectionable-C uses
a Smalltalk-like syntax, but lacks the flexibility of Smalltalk method calls,
and (like many such efforts) comes frustratingly close to attaining the
{Right Thing} without actually doing so.
