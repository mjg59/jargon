 WYSIWYG: /wiz'ee-wig/ adj. Describes a user interface under which "what you
see is what you get"; as opposed to one which uses more-or-less obscure
commands which do not result in immediate visual feedback. The term can be
mildly derogatory, as it is often used to refer to dumbed-down
{user-friendly} interfaces targeted at non-programmers, while a hacker has no
fear of obscure commands. On the other hand, EMACS was one of the very first
WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely
obscure, command-based {TECO}. see also {WIMP environment}. [Oddly enough,
this term has already made it into the OED --- ESR] = X = ===== X: /eks/ n.
1. Used in various speech and writing contexts in roughly its algebraic sense
of `unknown within a set defined by context' (compare {N}). Thus: the
abbreviation 680x0 stands for 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, or 68040, and 80x86
stands for 80186, 80286 80386 or 80486 (note that a UNIX hacker might write
these as 680[0-4]0 and 80[1-4]86 or 680?0 and 80?86 respectively; see
{glob}). 2. [after the name of an earlier window system called `W'] An
over-sized, over-featured, over-engineered window system developed at MIT and
widely used on UNIX systems.
