 :WYSIWYG: /wiz'ee-wig/ /adj./ Describes a user interface under which "What
You see Is What You Get", as opposed to one that uses more-or-less obscure
commands that do not result in immediate visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in
environments supporting multiple fonts or graphics is a a rarely-attained
ideal; there are variants of this term to express real-world manifestations
including WYSIAWYG (What You see Is *Almost* What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG
(What You see Is More or Less What You Get). All these can be mildly
derogatory, as they are often used to refer to dumbed-down {user-friendly}
interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure
commands (compare {WYSIAYG}). On the other hand, {EMACS} was one of the very
first WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the
extremely obscure, command-based {TECO}. see also {WIMP environment}. [Oddly
enough, WYSIWYG has already made it into the OED, in lower case yet. --ESR] =
