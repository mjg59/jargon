 :WYSIWYG: /wiz´ee·wig/, /wiss´ee·wig/, adj. [Traced to Flip Wilson's
"Geraldine" character c.1970] Describes a user interface under which "What
You see Is What You Get", as opposed to one that uses more-or-less obscure
commands that do not result in immediate visual feedback. True WYSIWYG in
environments supporting multiple fonts or graphics is a rarely-attained
ideal; there are variants of this term to express real-world manifestations
including WYSIAWYG (What You see Is Almost What You Get) and WYSIMOLWYG (What
You see Is More or Less What You Get). All these can be mildly derogatory, as
they are often used to refer to dumbed-down {user-friendly} interfaces
targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands
(compare {WYSIAYG}). On the other hand, {EMACS} was one of the very first
WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying) the extremely
obscure, command-based {TECO}. see also {WIMP environment}. [Oddly enough,
WYSIWYG made it into the 1986 supplement to the OED, in lower case yet.
