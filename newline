 NEWLINE /n[y]oo'lien/ n. 1. [UNIX] The ASCII LF character (decimal 10), used
under UNIX as a text line terminator. A Bell-Labs-ism rather than a
Berkeleyism; interestingly (and unusually for UNIX slang) it is said
originally to have been an IBM usage. 2. More generally, any magic character
sequence or operation (like Pascal's writeln() function) required to
terminate a text record. see CRLF, TERPRI.
