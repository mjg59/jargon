 :newline: /n[y]oo'li:n/ n. 1. [techspeak, primarily Unix] The ASCII LF
character (0001010), used under {{Unix}} as a text line terminator. Though
the term `newline' appears in ASCII standards, it never caught on in the
general computing world before Unix. 2. More generally, any magic character,
character sequence, or operation (like Pascal's writeln procedure) required
to terminate a text record or separate lines. see {crlf}, {terpri}.
