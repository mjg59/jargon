 :newline: /n[y]oo'li:n/ n. 1. [techspeak, primarily UNIX] The ASCII LF
character (0001010), used under {{UNIX}} as a text line terminator. A
Bell-Labs-ism rather than a Berkeleyism; interestingly (and unusually for
UNIX jargon), it is said to have originally been an IBM usage. (Though the
term `newline' appears in ASCII standards, it never caught on in the general
computing world before UNIX). 2. More generally, any magic character,
character sequence, or operation (like Pascal's writeln procedure) required
to terminate a text record or separate lines. see {crlf}, {terpri}.
