 :speedometer: n. A pattern of lights displayed on a linear set of LEDs
(today) or nixie tubes (yesterday, on ancient mainframes). The pattern is
shifted left every N times the operating system goes through its {main loop}.
A swiftly moving pattern indicates that the system is mostly idle; the
speedometer slows down as the system becomes overloaded. The speedometer on
Sun Microsystems hardware bounces back and forth like the eyes on one of the
Cylons from the wretched "Battlestar Galactica" TV series. Historical note:
One computer, the GE 600 (later Honeywell 6000) actually had an _analog_
speedometer on the front panel, calibrated in instructions executed per
second.
