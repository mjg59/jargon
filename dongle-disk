 :dongle-disk: /don'gl disk/ n. see {dongle}; a `dongle-disk' is a floppy
disk which is required in order to perform some task. Some contain special
coding that allows an application to identify it uniquely, others *are*
special code that does something that normally-resident programs don't or
can't. (For example, AT&T's "Unix PC" would only come up in {root mode} with
a special boot disk.) Also called a `key disk'.
