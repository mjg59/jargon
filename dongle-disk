 :dongle-disk: /don'gl disk/ n. A special floppy disk that is required in
order to perform some task. Some contain special coding that allows an
application to identify it uniquely, others *are* special code that does
something that normally-resident programs don't or can't. (For example,
AT&T's "Unix PC" would only come up in {root mode} with a special boot disk.)
Also called a `key disk'. see {dongle}.
