 EXEC 2 and EXEC 8 operating systems. 3. At IBM and VM/CMS shops, the
equivalent of a shell command file (among VM/CMS users). The mainstream
`exec' as an abbreviation for (human) executive is _not_ used. To a hacker,
an `exec' is a always a program, never a person. :exercise, left as an: adj.
[from technical books] Used to complete a proof when one doesn't mind a
{handwave}, or to avoid one entirely. The complete phrase is: "The proof [or
`the rest'] is left as an exercise for the reader." This comment _has_
occasionally been attached to unsolved research problems by authors possessed
of either an evil sense of humor or a vast faith in the capabilities of their
audiences. :Exon: /eks'on/ excl. A generic obscenity that quickly entered
wide use on the Internet and Usenet after {Black Thursday}. From the last
name of Senator James Exon (Democrat-Nebraska), primary author of the {CDA}.
:Exploder: n. Used within Microsoft to refer to the Windows Explorer, the
interface component of Windows 95 and WinNT 4. Our spies report that most of
the heavy guns at MS came from a Unix background and use command line
utilities; even they are scornful of the over-gingerbreaded {WIMP
environment}s that they have been called upon to create. :exploit: n.
[originally cracker slang] 1. A vulnerability in software that can be used
for breaking security or otherwise attacking an Internet host over the
network. The {Ping O' Death} is a famous exploit. 2. More grammatically, a
program that exploits an exploit in sense 1, :external memory: n. A memo pad,
palmtop computer, or written notes. "Hold on while I write that to external
memory". The analogy is with store or DRAM versus nonvolatile disk storage on
computers. :eye candy: /i:' kand`ee/ n. [from mainstream slang "ear candy"] A
display of some sort that's presented to {luser}s to keep them distracted
while the program performs necessary background tasks. "Give 'em some eye
candy while the back-end {slurp}s that {BLOB} into core." Reported as
mainstream usage among players of graphics-heavy computer games. We're also
told this term is mainstream slang for soft pornography, but that sense does
not appear to be live among hackers. :eyeball search: n.,v. To look for
something in a mass of code or data with one's own native optical sensors, as
opposed to using some sort of pattern matching software like {grep} or any
other automated search tool. Also called a {vgrep}; compare {vdiff}, {desk
check}. = F = ===== :face time: n. [common] Time spent interacting with
somebody face-to-face (as opposed to via electronic links). "Oh, yeah, I
spent some face time with him at the last Usenix." :factor: n. see
{coefficient of X}. :fairings: n. /fer'ingz/ [FreeBSD; orig. a typo for
`fairness'] A term thrown out in discussion whenever a completely and
transparently nonsensical argument in one's favor(?) seems called for, e,g.
at the end of a really long thread for which the outcome is no longer even
cared about since everyone is now so sick of it; or in rebuttal to another
nonsensical argument ("Change the loader to look for /kernel.pl? What about
fairings?") :fall over: vi. [IBM] Yet another synonym for {crash} or {lose}.
`Fall over hard' equates to {crash and burn}. :fall through: v. (n.
`fallthrough', var. `fall-through') 1. To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by
having fulfilled its exit condition rather than via a break or exception
condition that exits from the middle of it. This usage appears to be _really_
old, dating from the 1940s and 1950s. 2. To fail a test that would have
passed control to a subroutine or some other distant portion of code. 3. In
C, `fall-through' occurs when the flow of execution in a switch statement
reaches a `case' label other than by jumping there from the switch header,
passing a point where one would normally expect to find a `break'. A trivial
example: switch (color) { case GREEN: do_green(); break; case PINK:
do_pink(); /* FALL THROUGH */ case RED: do_red(); break; default: do_blue();
break; } The variant spelling `/* FALL THRU */' is also common. The effect of
the above code is to `do_green()' when color is `GREEN', `do_red()' when
color is `RED', `do_blue()' on any other color other than `PINK', and (and
this is the important part) `do_pink()' _and then_ `do_red()' when color is
`PINK'. Fall-through is {considered harmful} by some, though there are
contexts (such as the coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is
generally considered good practice to include a comment highlighting the
fall-through where one would normally expect a break. see also {Duff's
device}. :fan: n. Without qualification, indicates a fan of science fiction,
especially one who goes to {con}s and tends to hang out with other fans. Many
hackers are fans, so this term has been imported from fannish slang; however,
unlike much fannish slang it is recognized by most non-fannish hackers. Among
SF fans the plural is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to
hackers. "Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't really a fan."
:fandango on core: n. [Unix/C hackers, from the Iberian dance] In C, a wild
pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a {core dump}, or corrupts the
`malloc(3)' {arena} in such a way as to cause mysterious failures later on,
is sometimes said to have `done a fandango on core'. On low-end personal
machines without an MMU (or Windows boxes, which have an MMU but use it
incompetently), this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive lossage.
Other frenetic dances such as the cha-cha or the watusi, may be substituted.
see {aliasing bug}, {precedence lossage}, {smash the stack}, {memory leak},
{memory smash}, {overrun screw}, {core}. :FAQ: /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ n. [Usenet]
1. A Frequently Asked Question. 2. A compendium of accumulated lore, posted
periodically to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such
questions. Some people prefer the term `FAQ list' or `FAQL' /fa'kl/,
reserving `FAQ' for sense 1. This lexicon itself serves as a good example of
a collection of one kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular
FAQ posting. Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?" and "What's that
funny name for the `#' character?" are both Frequently Asked Questions.
Several FAQs refer readers to this file. :FAQ list: /F-A-Q list/ or /fak
list/ n. [common; Usenet] Syn {FAQ}, sense 2. :FAQL: /fa'kl/ n. Syn. {FAQ
list}. :faradize: /far'*-di:z/ v. [US Geological Survey] To start any
hyper-addictive process or trend, or to continue adding current to such a
trend. Telling one user about a new octo-tetris game you compiled would be a
faradizing act -- in two weeks you might find your entire department playing
the faradic game. :farkled: /far'kld/ adj. [DeVry Institute of Technology,
Atlanta] Syn. {hosed}. Poss. owes something to Yiddish `farblondjet' and/or
the `Farkle Family' skits on "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In", a popular comedy
show of the late 1960s. :farming: n. [Adelaide University, Australia] What
the heads of a disk drive are said to do when they plow little furrows in the
magnetic media. Associated with a {crash}. Typically used as follows: "Oh no,
the machine has just crashed; I hope the hard drive hasn't gone {farming}
again." No longer common; modern drives automatically park their heads in a
safe zone on power-down, so it takes a real mechanical problem to induce
this. :fascist: adj. 1. [common] Said of a computer system with excessive or
annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access policies. The implication
is that said policies are preventing hackers from getting interesting work
done. The variant `fascistic' seems to have been preferred at MIT, poss. by
analogy with `touristic' (see {tourist} or under the influence of
German/Yiddish `faschistisch'). 2. In the design of languages and other
software tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most restrictive and
structured way of capturing a particular function; the implication is that
this may be desirable in order to simplify the implementation or provide
tighter error checking. Compare {bondage-and-discipline language}, although
that term is global rather than local. :fat electrons: n. Old-time hacker
David Cargill's theory on the causation of computer glitches. Your typical
electric utility draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair
of coil taps located near the top of the dynamo. When the normal tap brushes
get dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and use special
auxiliary taps on the _bottom_ of the coil. Now, this is a problem, because
when they do that they get not ordinary or `thin' electrons, but the
fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the
generator. These flow down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to
turn a sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get
stuck. This is what causes computer glitches. [Fascinating. Obviously, fat
electrons must gain mass by {bogon} absorption --ESR] Compare {bogon}, {magic
smoke}. :fat-finger: vt. 1. To introduce a typo while editing in such a way
that the resulting manglification of a configuration file does something
useless, damaging, or wildly unexpected. "NSI fat-fingered their DNS zone
file and took half the net down again." 2. More generally, any typo that
produces dramatically bad results. :faulty: adj. Non-functional; buggy. Same
denotation as {bletcherous}, {losing}, q.v., but the connotation is much
milder. :fd leak: /F-D leek/ n. A kind of programming bug analogous to a
{core leak}, in which a program fails to close file descriptors (`fd's) after
file operations are completed, and thus eventually runs out of them. see
{leak}. :fear and loathing: n. [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state inspired by
the prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems and standards that
are totally {brain-damaged} but ubiquitous -- Intel 8086s, or {COBOL}, or
{{EBCDIC}}, or any {IBM} machine bigger than a workstation. "Ack! They want
PCs to be able to talk to the AI machine. Fear and loathing time!" :feature:
n. 1. [common] A good property or behavior (as of a program). Whether it was
intended or not is immaterial. 2. [common] An intended property or behavior
(as of a program). Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is
also a {misfeature}). 3. A surprising property or behavior; in particular,
one that is purposely inconsistent because it works better that way -- such
an inconsistency is therefore a {feature} and not a {bug}. This kind of
feature is sometimes called a {miswart}; see that entry for a classic
example. 4. A property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
perhaps also impressive or cute. For example, one feature of Common LISP's
`format' function is the ability to print numbers in two different
Roman-numeral formats (see {bells whistles and gongs}). 5. A property or
behavior that was put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your
way. 6. [common] A bug that has been documented. To call something a feature
sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the particular
case, and that the program responded in a way that was unexpected but not
strictly incorrect. A standard joke is that a bug can be turned into a
{feature} simply by documenting it (then theoretically no one can complain
about it because it's in the manual), or even by simply declaring it to be
good. "That's not a bug, that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase. see also
{feetch feetch}, {creeping featurism}, {wart}, {green lightning}. The
relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and miswarts might be
clarified by the following hypothetical exchange between two hackers on an
airliner: A: "This seat doesn't recline." B: "That's not a bug, that's a
feature. There is an emergency exit door built around the window behind you,
and the route has to be kept clear." A: "Oh. Then it's a misfeature; they
should have increased the spacing between rows here." B: "Yes. But if they'd
increased spacing in only one section it would have been a wart -- they
would've had to make nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the
displaced seats." A: "A miswart, actually. If they increased spacing
throughout they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin. So
unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing." B: "Indeed."
`Undocumented feature' is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism for a {bug}.
There's a related joke that is sometimes referred to as the "one-question
geek test". You say to someone "I saw a Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity
license plate that read FEATURE". If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see
{computer geek}, sense 2). :feature creature: n. [poss. fr. slang `creature
feature' for a horror movie] 1. One who loves to add features to designs or
programs, perhaps at the expense of coherence, concision, or {taste}. 2.
Alternately, a mythical being that induces otherwise rational programmers to
perpetrate such crocks. see also {feeping creaturism}, {creeping featurism}.
:feature creep: n. [common] The result of {creeping featurism}, as in "Emacs
has a bad case of feature creep". :feature key: n. [common] The Macintosh key
with the cloverleaf graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower',
`pretzel', `clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an apparent reference to the
major feature of a propeller beanie), {splat}, `open-apple' or (officially,
in Mac documentation) the `command key'. In French, the term `papillon'
(butterfly) has been reported. The proliferation of terms for this creature
may illustrate one subtle peril of iconic interfaces. Many people have been
mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that appears on the feature key. Its
oldest name is `cross of St. Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking
art as a decorative motif. Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use
it to mark sites of historical interest. Apple picked up the symbol from an
early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish. Apple documentation gives the
translation "interesting feature"! There is some dispute as to the proper
(Swedish) name of this symbol. It technically stands for the word
`seva"rdhet' (thing worth seeing); many of these are old churches. Some
Swedes report as an idiom for the sign the word `kyrka', cognate to English
`church' and pronounced (roughly) /chur'ka/ in modern Swedish. Others say
this is nonsense. Other idioms reported for the sign are `runa' (rune) or
`runsten' /roon'stn/ (runestone), derived from the fact that many of the
interesting features are Viking rune-stones. The term `fornminne'
/foorn'min'*/ (relic of antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported,
especially among those who think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.
:feature shock: n. [from Alvin Toffler's book title "Future Shock"] A user's
(or programmer's!) confusion when confronted with a package that has too many
features and poor introductory material. :featurectomy: /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/
n. The act of removing a feature from a program. Featurectomies come in two
flavors, the `righteous' and the `reluctant'. Righteous featurectomies are
performed because the remover believes the program would be more elegant
without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and better way to
achieve the same end. (Doing so is not quite the same thing as removing a
{misfeature}.) Reluctant featurectomies are performed to satisfy some
external constraint such as code size or execution speed. :feep: /feep/ 1. n.
The soft electronic `bell' sound of a display terminal (except for a VT-52);
a beep (in fact, the microcomputer world seems to prefer {beep}). 2. vi. To
cause the display to make a feep sound. ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do not
feep; they have mechanical bells that ring. Alternate forms: {beep}, `bleep',
or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic. (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic
strip "Shoe", uses the word `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and
video games; this is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.) The term
`breedle' was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not
particularly soft (they sound more like the musical equivalent of a raspberry
or Bronx cheer; for a close approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek
communicator's beep lasting for five seconds). The `feeper' on a VT-52 has
been compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. see also
{ding}. :feeper: /fee'pr/ n. The device in a terminal or workstation (usually
a loudspeaker of some kind) that makes the {feep} sound. :feeping creature:
n. [from {feeping creaturism}] An unnecessary feature; a bit of {chrome}
that, in the speaker's judgment, is the camel's nose for a whole horde of new
features. :feeping creaturism: /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n. A deliberate
spoonerism for {creeping featurism}, meant to imply that the system or
program in question has become a misshapen creature of hacks. This term isn't
really well defined, but it sounds so neat that most hackers have said or
heard it. It is probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about
in the dark making their customary noises. :feetch feetch: /feech feech/
interj. If someone tells you about some new improvement to a program, you
might respond: "Feetch, feetch!" The meaning of this depends critically on
vocal inflection. With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy, that's
great! What a great hack!" Grudgingly or with obvious doubt, it means "I
don't know; it sounds like just one more unnecessary and complicated thing".
With a tone of resignation, it means, "Well, I'd rather keep it simple, but I
suppose it has to be done". :fence: n. 1. A sequence of one or more
distinguished ({out-of-band}) characters (or other data items), used to
delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the
computer-science literature calls this a `sentinel'). The NUL (ASCII 0000000)
character that terminates strings in C is a fence. Hex FF is also (though
slightly less frequently) used this way. see {zigamorph}. 2. An extra data
value inserted in an array or other data structure in order to allow some
normal test on the array's contents also to function as a termination test.
For example, a highly optimized routine for finding a value in an array might
artificially place a copy of the value to be searched for after the last slot
of the array, thus allowing the main search loop to search for the value
without having to check at each pass whether the end of the array had been
reached. 3. [among users of optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually
exploiting knowledge about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations.
Used when explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill. Typically a
hack: "I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the optimizer's
register-coloring info" can be expressed by the shorter "That's a fence
procedure". :fencepost error: n. 1. [common] A problem with the discrete
equivalent of a boundary condition, often exhibited in programs by iterative
loops. From the following problem: "If you build a fence 100 feet long with
posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you need?" (Either 9 or 11 is a better
answer than the obvious 10.) For example, suppose you have a long list or
array of items, and want to process items m through n; how many items are
there? The obvious answer is n - m, but that is off by one; the right answer
is n - m + 1. A program that used the `obvious' formula would have a
fencepost error in it. see also {zeroth} and {off-by-one error}, and note
that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost errors. The game of Musical
Chairs involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where N people try to sit in
N - 1 chairs, but it's not a fencepost error. Fencepost errors come from
counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by
neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row. 2.
[rare] An error induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can
(for instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree or
hash table implementation. (The error here involves the difference between
expected and worst case behaviors of an algorithm.) :fiber-seeking backhoe:
[common among backbone ISP personnel] Any of a genus of large, disruptive
machines which routinely cut critical backbone links, creating Internet
outages and {packet over air} problems. :FidoNet: n. A worldwide hobbyist
network of personal computers which exchanges mail, discussion groups, and
files. Founded in 1984 and originally consisting only of IBM PCs and
compatibles, FidoNet now includes such diverse machines as Apple ][s, Ataris,
Amigas, and Unix systems. For years FidoNet actually grew faster than Usenet,
but the advent of cheap Internet access probably means its days are numbered.
In early 1999 Fidonet has approximately 30,000 nodes, down from 38K in 1996.
:field circus: n. [a derogatory pun on `field service'] The field service
organization of any hardware manufacturer, but originally {DEC}. There is an
entire genre of jokes about field circus engineers: Q: How can you recognize
a field circus engineer with a flat tire? A: He's changing one tire at a time
to see which one is flat. Q: How can you recognize a field circus engineer
who is out of gas? A: He's changing one tire at a time to see which one is
flat. Q: How can you tell it's _your_ field circus engineer? A: The spare is
flat, too. [see {Easter egging} for additional insight on these jokes.] There
is also the `Field Circus Cheer' (from the old {plan file} for DEC on
MIT-AI): Maynard! Maynard! Don't mess with us! We're mean and we're tough! If
you get us confused We'll screw up your stuff. (DEC's service HQ, still
extant under the Compaq regime, is located in Maynard, Massachusetts.) :field
servoid: [play on `android'] /fee'ld ser'voyd/ n. Representative of a field
service organization (see {field circus}). This has many of the implications
of {droid}. :Fight-o-net: n. [FidoNet] Deliberate distortion of {FidoNet},
often applied after a flurry of {flamage} in a particular {echo}, especially
the SYSOP echo or Fidonews (see {'Snooze}). :File Attach: [FidoNet] 1. n. A
file sent along with a mail message from one FidoNet to another. 2. vt.
Sending someone a file by using the File Attach option in a FidoNet mailer.
:File Request: [FidoNet] 1. n. The {FidoNet} equivalent of {FTP}, in which
one FidoNet system automatically dials another and {snarf}s one or more
files. Often abbreviated `FReq'; files are often announced as being
"available for FReq" in the same way that files are announced as being
"available for/by anonymous FTP" on the Internet. 2. vt. The act of getting a
copy of a file by using the File Request option of the FidoNet mailer. :file
signature: n. A {magic number}, sense 3. :filk: /filk/ n.,v. [from SF fandom,
where a typo for `folk' was adopted as a new word] A popular or folk song
with lyrics revised or completely new lyrics and/or music, intended for
humorous effect when read, and/or to be sung late at night at SF conventions.
There is a flourishing subgenre of these called `computer filks', written by
hackers and often containing rather sophisticated technical humor. see
{double bucky} for an example. Compare {grilf}, {hing}, {pr0n}, and
{newsfroup}. :film at 11: [MIT: in parody of TV newscasters] 1. Used in
conversation to announce ordinary events, with a sarcastic implication that
these events are earth-shattering. "{{ITS}} crashes; film at 11." "Bug found
in scheduler; film at 11." 2. Also widely used outside MIT to indicate that
additional information will be available at some future time, _without_ the
implication of anything particularly ordinary about the referenced event. For
example, "The mail file server died this morning; we found garbage all over
the root directory. Film at 11." would indicate that a major failure had
occurred but that the people working on it have no additional information
about it as yet; use of the phrase in this way suggests gently that the
problem is liable to be fixed more quickly if the people doing the fixing can
spend time doing the fixing rather than responding to questions, the answers
to which will appear on the normal "11:00 news", if people will just be
patient. The variant "MPEGs at 11" has recently been cited (MPEG is a
digital-video format.) :filter: n. [very common; orig. {{Unix}}, now also in
{{MS-DOS}}] A program that processes an input data stream into an output data
stream in some well-defined way, and does no I/O to anywhere else except
possibly on error conditions; one designed to be used as a stage in a
`pipeline' (see {plumbing}). Compare {sponge}. :Finagle's Law: n. The
generalized or `folk' version of {Murphy's Law}, fully named "Finagle's Law
of Dynamic Negatives" and usually rendered "Anything that can go wrong,
will". One variant favored among hackers is "The perversity of the Universe
tends towards a maximum" (but see also {Hanlon's Razor}). The label
`Finagle's Law' was popularized by SF author Larry Niven in several stories
depicting a frontier culture of asteroid miners; this `Belter' culture
professed a religion and/or running joke involving the worship of the dread
god Finagle and his mad prophet Murphy. Some technical and scientific
cultures (e.g., paleontologists) know it under the name `Sod's Law'; this
usage may be more common in Great Britain. :fine: adj. [WPI] Good, but not
good enough to be {cuspy}. The word `fine' is used elsewhere, of course, but
without the implicit comparison to the higher level implied by {cuspy}.
:finger: [WAITS, via BSD Unix] 1. n. A program that displays information
about a particular user or all users logged on the system, or a remote
system. Typically shows full name, last login time, idle time, terminal line,
and terminal location (where applicable). May also display a {plan file} left
by the user (see also {Hacking X for Y}). 2. vt. To apply finger to a
username. 3. vt. By extension, to check a human's current state by any means.
"Foodp?" "T!" "OK, finger Lisa and see if she's idle." 4. Any picture
(composed of ASCII characters) depicting `the finger'. Originally a humorous
component of one's plan file to deter the curious fingerer (sense 2), it has
entered the arsenal of some {flamer}s. :finger trouble: n. Mistyping, typos,
or generalized keyboard incompetence (this is surprisingly common among
hackers, given the amount of time they spend at keyboards). "I keep putting
colons at the end of statements instead of semicolons", "Finger trouble
again, eh?". :finger-pointing syndrome: n. All-too-frequent result of bugs,
esp. in new or experimental configurations. The hardware vendor points a
finger at the software. The software vendor points a finger at the hardware.
All the poor users get is the finger. :finn: v. [IRC] To pull rank on
somebody based on the amount of time one has spent on {IRC}. The term derives
from the fact that IRC was originally written in Finland in 1987. There may
be some influence from the `Finn' character in William Gibson's seminal
cyberpunk novel "Count Zero", who at one point says to another (much younger)
character "I have a pair of shoes older than you are, so shut up!"
:firebottle: n.obs. A large, primitive, power-hungry active electrical
device, similar in function to a FET but constructed out of glass, metal, and
vacuum. Characterized by high cost, low density, low reliability,
high-temperature operation, and high power dissipation. Sometimes mistakenly
called a `tube' in the U.S. or a `valve' in England; another hackish term is
{glassfet}. :firefighting: n. 1. What sysadmins have to do to correct sudden
operational problems. An opposite of hacking. "Been hacking your new
newsreader?" "No, a power glitch hosed the network and I spent the whole
afternoon fighting fires." 2. The act of throwing lots of manpower and late
nights at a project, esp. to get it out before deadline. see also {gang
bang}, {Mongolian Hordes technique}; however, the term `firefighting'
connotes that the effort is going into chasing bugs rather than adding
features. :firehose syndrome: n. In mainstream folklore it is observed that
trying to drink from a firehose can be a good way to rip your lips off. On
computer networks, the absence or failure of flow control mechanisms can lead
to situations in which the sending system sprays a massive flood of packets
at an unfortunate receiving system, more than it can handle. Compare
{overrun}, {buffer overflow}. :firewall code: n. 1. The code you put in a
system (say, a telephone switch) to make sure that the users can't do any
damage. Since users always want to be able to do everything but never want to
suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a firewall is a question not
only of defensive coding but also of interface presentation, so that users
don't even get curious about those corners of a system where they can burn
themselves. 2. Any sanity check inserted to catch a {can't happen} error.
Wise programmers often change code to fix a bug twice: once to fix the bug,
and once to insert a firewall which would have arrested the bug before it did
quite as much damage. :firewall machine: n. A dedicated gateway machine with
special security precautions on it, used to service outside network
connections and dial-in lines. The idea is to protect a cluster of more
loosely administered machines hidden behind it from {cracker}s. The typical
firewall is an inexpensive micro-based Unix box kept clean of critical data,
with a bunch of modems and public network ports on it but just one carefully
watched connection back to the rest of the cluster. The special precautions
may include threat monitoring, callback, and even a complete {iron box}
keyable to particular incoming IDs or activity patterns. Syn. {flytrap},
{Venus flytrap}. [When first coined in the mid-1980s this term was pure
jargon. Now (1999) it is techspeak, and has been retained only as an example
of uptake --ESR] :fireworks mode: n. 1. The mode a machine is sometimes said
to be in when it is performing a {crash and burn} operation. 2. There is (or
was) a more specific meaning of this term in the Amiga community. The word
fireworks described the effects of a particularly serious crash which
prevented the video pointer(s) from getting reset at the start of the
vertical blank. This caused the DAC to scroll through the entire contents of
CHIP (video or video+CPU) memory. Since each bit plane would scroll
separately this was quite a spectacular effect. :firmware: /ferm'weir/ n.
Embedded software contained in EPROM or flash memory. It isn't quite
hardware, but at least doesn't have to be loaded from a disk like regular
software. Hacker usage differs from straight techspeak in that hackers don't
normally apply it to stuff that you can't possibly get at, such as the
program that runs a pocket calculator. Instead, it implies that the firmware
could be changed, even if doing so would mean opening a box and plugging in a
new chip. A computer's BIOS is the classic example, although nowadays there
is firmware in disk controllers, modems, video cards and even CD-ROM drives.
:firmy: /fer'mee/ n. Syn. {stiffy} (a 3.5-inch floppy disk). :fish: n.
[Adelaide University, Australia] 1. Another {metasyntactic variable}. see
{foo}. Derived originally from the Monty Python skit in the middle of "The
Meaning of Life" entitled "Find the Fish". 2. A pun for `microfiche'. A
microfiche file cabinet may be referred to as a `fish tank'. :FISH queue: n.
[acronym, by analogy with FIFO (First In, First Out)] `First In, Still Here'.
A joking way of pointing out that processing of a particular sequence of
events or requests has stopped dead. Also `FISH mode' and `FISHnet'; the
latter may be applied to any network that is running really slowly or
exhibiting extreme flakiness. :FITNR: // adj. [Thinking Machines, Inc.] Fixed
In The Next Release. A written-only notation attached to bug reports. Often
wishful thinking. :fix: n.,v. What one does when a problem has been reported
too many times to be ignored. :FIXME: imp. [common] A standard tag often put
in C comments near a piece of code that needs work. The point of doing so is
that a `grep' or a similar pattern-matching tool can find all such places
quickly. /* FIXME: note this is common in {GNU} code. */ Compare {XXX}.
:flag: n. [very common] A variable or quantity that can take on one of two
values; a bit, particularly one that is used to indicate one of two outcomes
or is used to control which of two things is to be done. "This flag controls
whether to clear the screen before printing the message." "The program status
word contains several flag bits." Used of humans analogously to {bit}. see
also {hidden flag}, {mode bit}. :flag day: n. A software change that is
neither forward- nor backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and
costly to reverse. "Can we install that without causing a flag day for all
users?" This term has nothing to do with the use of the word {flag} to mean a
variable that has two values. It came into use when a massive change was made
to the {{Multics}} timesharing system to convert from the short-lived 1965
version of the ASCII code to the 1967 version (in draft at the time); this
was scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966. The actual change
moved the code point for the ASCII newline character; this required that all
of the Multics source code, documentation, and device drivers be changed
simultaneously. see also {backward combatability}. :flaky: adj. (var sp.
`flakey') Subject to frequent {lossage}. This use is of course related to the
common slang use of the word to describe a person as eccentric, crazy, or
just unreliable. A system that is flaky is working, sort of -- enough that
you are tempted to try to use it -- but fails frequently enough that the odds
in favor of finishing what you start are low. Commonwealth hackish prefers
{dodgy} or {wonky}. :flamage: /flay'm*j/ n. [very common] Flaming verbiage,
esp. high-noise, low-signal postings to {Usenet} or other electronic {fora}.
Often in the phrase `the usual flamage'. `Flaming' is the act itself;
`flamage' the content; a `flame' is a single flaming message. see {flame},
also {dahmum}. :flame: [at MIT, orig. from the phrase `flaming asshole'] 1.
vi. To post an email message intended to insult and provoke. 2. vi. To speak
incessantly and/or rabidly on some relatively uninteresting subject or with a
patently ridiculous attitude. 3. vt. Either of senses 1 or 2, directed with
hostility at a particular person or people. 4. n. An instance of flaming.
When a discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might tell the
participants "Now you're just flaming" or "Stop all that flamage!" to try to
get them to cool down (so to speak). The term may have been independently
invented at several different places. It has been reported from MIT, Carleton
College and RPI (among many other places) from as far back as 1969, and from
the University of Virginia in the early 1960s. It is possible that the
hackish sense of `flame' is much older than that. The poet Chaucer was also
what passed for a wizard hacker in his time; he wrote a treatise on the
astrolabe, the most advanced computing device of the day. In Chaucer's
"Troilus and Cressida", Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of
a particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes that it's
called "the fleminge of wrecches." This phrase seems to have been intended in
context as "that which puts the wretches to flight" but was probably just as
ambiguous in Middle English as "the flaming of wretches" would be today. One
suspects that Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet. :flame bait: n.
[common] A posting intended to trigger a {flame war}, or one that invites
flames in reply. see also {troll}. :flame on: vi.,interj. 1. To begin to
{flame}. The punning reference to Marvel Comics's Human Torch is no longer
widely recognized. 2. To continue to flame. see {rave}, {burble}. :flame war:
n. [common] (var. `flamewar') An acrimonious dispute, especially when
conducted on a public electronic forum such as {Usenet}. :flamer: n. [common]
One who habitually {flame}s. Said esp. of obnoxious {Usenet} personalities.
:flap: vt. 1. [obs.] To unload a DECtape (so it goes flap, flap, flap...).
Old-time hackers at MIT tell of the days when the disk was device 0 and DEC
microtapes were 1, 2,... and attempting to flap device 0 would instead start
a motor banging inside a cabinet near the disk.
