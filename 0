 :0: Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O' (the 15th letter of the
English alphabet). In their unmodified forms they look a lot alike, and
various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have compounded the
confusion. If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is not, or if letter-O
looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an American football stood
on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a modern character
display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as an option on IBM
3270 controllers). If your zero is slashed but letter-O is not, you're
probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set descended from the default
typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom /O is a
letter, curse this arrangement). (Interestingly, the slashed zero long
predates computers; Florian Cajori's monumental "A History of Mathematical
Notations" notes that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.)
If letter-O has a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is
tuned for a very old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe
makers (Scandinavians curse _this_ arrangement even more, because it means
two of their letters collide). Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a
zero with a _reversed_ slash. Old CDC computers rendered letter O as an
unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken at upper right and lower left. And yet
another convention common on early line printers left zero unornamented but
added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or
cursive capital letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how
to draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to
a tick-mark in the upper-left corner). Are we sufficiently confused yet?
