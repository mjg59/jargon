 :flowchart:: [techspeak] n. An archaic form of visual control-flow
specification employing arrows and `speech balloons' of various shapes.
Hackers never use flowcharts, consider them extremely silly, and associate
them with {COBOL} programmers, {card walloper}s, and other lower forms of
life. This attitude follows from the observations that flowcharts (at least
from a hacker's point of view) are no easier to read than code, are less
precise, and tend to fall out of sync with the code (so that they either
obfuscate it rather than explaining it, or require extra maintenance effort
that doesn't improve the code). see also {pdl}, sense 3.
