 DUSTY DECK n. Old software (especially applications) with which one is
obliged to remain compatible. The term implies that the software in question
is a holdover from card-punch days. Used esp. when referring to old
scientific and number-crunching software, much of which was written in
FORTRAN and very poorly documented but would be too expensive to replace. see
FOSSIL.
