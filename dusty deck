 :dusty deck: n. Old software (especially applications) which one is obliged
to remain compatible with (or to maintain). The term implies that the
software in question is a holdover from card-punch days. Used esp. when
referring to old scientific and {number-crunching} software, much of which
was written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented but is believed to be too
expensive to replace. see {fossil}.
