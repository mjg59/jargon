 :dusty deck: /n./ Old software (especially applications) which one is
obliged to remain compatible with, or to maintain ({DP} types call this
`legacy code', a term hackers consider smarmy and excessively reverent). The
term implies that the software in question is a holdover from card-punch
days. Used esp. when referring to old scientific and {number-crunching}
software, much of which was written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented but
is believed to be too expensive to replace. see {fossil}; compare {crawling
horror}.
