 :unleaded: adj. Said of decaffeinated coffee, diet coke, and other imitation
{programming fluid}s. "Do you want regular or unleaded?". Appears to be
widespread among programmers associated with the oil industry in Texas (and
probably elsewhere). Usage: silly, and probably unintelligable to the next
generation of hackers.
