 :screen scraping: n. The act of capturing data from a system or program by
snooping the contents of some display that is not actually intended for data
transport or inspection by programs. Around 1980 this term referred to tricks
like reading the display memory of a smart terminal through its auxillary
port. Nowadays it often refers to parsing the HTML in generated web pages
with programs designed to mine out particular patterns of content. In either
guise screen-scraping is an ugly, ad-hoc, last-resort technique that is very
likely to break on even minor changes to the format of the data being
snooped.
