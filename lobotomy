 :lobotomy: /n./ 1. What a hacker subjected to formal management training is
said to have undergone. At IBM and elsewhere this term is used by both
hackers and low-level management; the latter doubtless intend it as a joke.
2. The act of removing the processor from a microcomputer in order to replace
or upgrade it. Some very cheap {clone} systems are sold in `lobotomized' form
-- everything but the brain.
