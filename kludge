 :kludge: 1. /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of
{kluge} (US). These two words have been confused in American usage since the
early 1960s, and widely confounded in Great Britain since the end of World
War II. 2. [TMRC] A {crock} that works. (A long-ago "Datamation" article by
Jackson Granholme similarly said: "An ill-assorted collection of poorly
matching parts, forming a distressing whole.") 3. v. To use a kludge to get
around a problem. "I've kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up
properly later." This word appears to have derived from Scots `kludge' or
`kludgie' for a common toilet, via British military slang. It apparently
became confused with U.S. {kluge} during or after World War II; some Britons
from that era use both words in definably different ways, but {kluge} is now
uncommon in Great Britain. `Kludge' in Commonwealth hackish differs in
meaning from `kluge' in that it lacks the positive senses; a kludge is
something no Commonwealth hacker wants to be associated too closely with.
Also, `kludge' is more widely known in British mainstream slang than `kluge'
is in the U.S.
