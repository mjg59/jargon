 GRIND CRANK (griend crank) n. A mythical accessory to a terminal. A crank on
the side of a monitor, which when operated makes a zizzing noise and causes
the computer to run faster. Usually one does not refer to a grind crank out
loud, but merely makes the appropriate gesture and noise. see GRIND, CHUNGA
CHUNGA CHUNGA and WUGGA WUGGA.
