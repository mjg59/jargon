 GRIND CRANK n. A mythical accessory to a terminal. A crank on the side of a
monitor, which when operated makes a zizzing noise and causes the computer to
run faster. Usually one does not refer to a grind crank out loud, but merely
makes the appropriate gesture and noise. see GRIND, and WUGGA WUGGA.
Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind crank --- the
R1, a research machine built towards the the end of the great days of vacuum
tube computers in 1959. R1 (also known as "The Rice Institute Computer" -
TRIC, and later as "The Rice University Computer" - TRUC) had a single
step/free run switch for use when debugging programs. Since single stepping
through a large program was rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam
and gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the single step button. This
allowed one to "crank" through a lot of code, then slow down to single step a
bit when you got near the code of interest, poke at some registers using the
"console typewriter", and then keep on cranking.
