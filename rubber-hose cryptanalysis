 :rubber-hose cryptanalysis: n. [sci.crypt newsgroup] The technique of
breaking a code or cipher by finding someone who has the key and applying a
rubber hose vigorously and repeatedly to the soles of that luckless person's
feet until the key is discovered. Shorthand for any method of coercion: the
originator of the term drily noted that it "can take a surprisingly short
time and is quite computationally inexpensive" relative to other
cryptanalysis methods. Compare {social engineering}, {brute force}.
