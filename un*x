 :UN*X: n. Used to refer to the Unix operating system (a trademark of AT&T,
then of Novell, then of Unix Systems Laboratories, then of the Open Group;
the source code parted company with it after Novell and was owned by SCO,
which was acquired by Caldera) in writing, but avoiding the need for the ugly
(TM) typography (see also {(TM)}). Also used to refer to any or all varieties
of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically, lawyers now say that the
requirement for the trademark postfix has no legal force, but the asterisk
usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been suggested that there may be a
psychological connection to practice in certain religions (especially
Judaism) in which the name of the deity is never written out in full, e.g.,
`YHWH' or `G--d' is used. see also {glob} and {splat out}.
