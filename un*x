 :UN*X: n. Used to refer to the UNIX operating system (a trademark of AT&T)
in writing, but avoiding the need for the ugly {(TM)} typography. Also used
to refer to any or all varieties of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically,
lawyers now say that the requirement for the TM-postfix has no legal force,
but the asterisk usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been suggested that there
may be a psychological connection to practice in certain religions
(especially Judaism) in which the name of the deity is never written out in
full, e.g., `YHWH' or `G--d' is used. see also {glob}.
