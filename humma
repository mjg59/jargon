 HUMMA excl. A filler word used on various "chat" and "talk" programs when
you had nothing to say but felt that it was important to say something. The
word apparently originated (at least with this definition) on the MECC
Timeshare System (MTS) a now-defunct educational time-sharing system running
in Michigan during the 1970s and early '80s, but was later sighted on early
UNIX systems.
