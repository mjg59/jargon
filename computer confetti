 :computer confetti: n. Syn. {chad}. [obs.] Though this term was common at
one time, this use of punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the pieces are
stiff and have sharp corners that could injure the eyes. GLS reports that he
once attended a wedding at MIT during which he and a few other guests
enthusiastically threw chad instead of rice. The groom later grumbled that he
and his bride had spent most of the evening trying to get the stuff out of
their hair. [2001 update: this term has passed out of use for two reasons;
(1) the stuff it describes is now quite rare, and (2) the term {chad}, which
was half-forgotten in 1990, has enjoyed a revival. --ESR]
