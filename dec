 :DEC: /dek/, n. n. Commonly used abbreviation for Digital Equipment
Corporation, later deprecated by DEC itself in favor of "Digital" and now
entirely obsolete following the buyout by Compaq. Before the {killer micro}
revolution of the late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's
pioneering timesharing machines. The first of the group of cultures described
by this lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see {TMRC}). Subsequently, the
PDP-6, {PDP-10}, {PDP-20}, {PDP-11} and {VAX} were all foci of large and
important hackerdoms, and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and
Internet machine population. DEC was the technological leader of the
minicomputer era (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace
microcomputers and Unix early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after
{silicon} got cheap. Nevertheless, the microprocessor design tradition owes a
major debt to the {PDP-11} instruction set, and every one of the major
general-purpose microcomputer OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows
NT) was either genetically descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC
hardware, or both. Accordingly, DEC was for many years still regarded with a
certain wry affection even among many hackers too young to have grown up on
DEC machines.
