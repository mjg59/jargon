 DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert to {VMS}, but instead, by
the late 1980s, most of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix. :twiddle:
n. 1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, `~'). Also called `squiggle', `sqiggle' (sic --
pronounced /skig'l/), and `twaddle', but twiddle is the most common term. 2.
A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually fixes one bug and
generates several new ones (see also {shotgun debugging}). 3. vt. To change
something in a small way. Bits, for example, are often twiddled. Twiddling a
switch or {knobs} implies much less sense of purpose than toggling or
tweaking it; see {frobnicate}. To speak of twiddling a bit connotes
aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what you're doing to the bit;
`toggling a bit' has a more specific meaning (see {bit twiddling}, {toggle}).
4. Uncommon name for the {twirling baton} prompt. :twilight zone: n. // [IRC]
Notionally, the area of cyberspace where {IRC} operators live. An {op} is
said to have a "connection to the twilight zone". :twink: /twink/ n. 1.
[Berkeley] A clue-repellant user; the next step beyond a clueless one. 2.
[UCSC] A {read-only user}. Also reported on the Usenet group soc.motss; may
derive from gay slang for a cute young thing with nothing upstairs (compare
mainstream `chick'). 3. On MU* systems that specialize in role-playing,
refers to behavior of a (usually inexperienced) player that either ignores
rules or social convention, or disrupts the natural flow of a scene to show
of super powers. :twirling baton: n. [PLATO] The overstrike sequence
-/|\-/|\- which produces an animated twirling baton. If you output it with a
single backspace between characters, the baton spins in place. If you output
the sequence BS SP between characters, the baton spins from left to right. If
you output BS SP BS BS between characters, the baton spins from right to
left. This is also occasionally called a twiddle prompt. The twirling baton
was a popular component of animated signature files on the pioneering PLATO
educational timesharing system. The `archie' Internet service is perhaps the
best-known baton program today; it uses the twirling baton as an idler
indicating that the program is working on a query. The twirling baton is also
used as a boot progress indicator on several BSD variants of Unix; if it
stops you're probably going to have a long and trying day. :two pi: quant.
The number of years it takes to finish one's thesis. Occurs in stories in the
following form: "He started on his thesis; 2 pi years later..."
:two-to-the-N: quant. An amount much larger than {N} but smaller than
{infinity}. "I have 2-to-the-N things to do before I can go out for lunch"
means you probably won't show up. :twonkie: /twon'kee/ n. The software
equivalent of a Twinkie (a variety of sugar-loaded junk food, or (in gay
slang with a small t) the male equivalent of `chick'); a useless `feature'
added to look sexy and placate a {marketroid} (compare {Saturday-night
special}). The term may also be related to "The Twonky", title menace of a
classic SF short story by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore),
first published in the September 1942 "Astounding Science Fiction" and
subsequently much anthologized. = U = ===== :u-: pref. Written shorthand for
{micro-}; techspeak when applied to metric units, jargon when used otherwise.
Derived from the Greek letter "mu", the first letter of "micro" (and which
letter looks a lot like the English letter "u"). :UBD: /U-B-D/ n.
[abbreviation for `User Brain Damage'] An abbreviation used to close out
trouble reports obviously due to utter cluelessness on the user's part.
Compare {pilot error}; oppose {PBD}; see also {brain-damaged}. :UBE: // n.
[abbrev., Unsolicited Bulk Email] A widespread, more formal term for email
{spam}. Compare {UCE}. The UBE term recognizes that spam is uttered by
nonprofit and advocacy groups whose motives are not commercial. :UCE: n.
[abbrev., Unsolicited Commercial Email] A widespread, more formal term for
email {spam}. Compare {UBE}, which may be superseding it. :UDP: /U-D-P/ v.,n.
[Usenet] Abbreviation for {Usenet Death Penalty}. Common (probably now more
so than the full form), and frequently verbed. Compare {IDP}. :UN*X: n. Used
to refer to the Unix operating system (a trademark of AT&T, then of Novell,
then of Univel, then of the Open Group; the source code parted company with
it after Novell and was owned by SCO, which was acquired by Caldera) in
writing, but avoiding the need for the ugly {(TM)} typography. Also used to
refer to any or all varieties of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically,
lawyers now say that the requirement for the trademark postfix has no legal
force, but the asterisk usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been suggested
that there may be a psychological connection to practice in certain religions
(especially Judaism) in which the name of the deity is never written out in
full, e.g., `YHWH' or `G-d' is used. see also {glob} and {splat out}.
:undefined external reference: excl. [Unix] A message from Unix's linker.
Used in speech to flag loose ends or dangling references in an argument or
discussion. :under the hood: adj. [hot-rodder talk] 1. Used to introduce the
underlying implementation of a product (hardware, software, or idea). Implies
that the implementation is not intuitively obvious from the appearance, but
the speaker is about to enable the listener to {grok} it. "Let's now look
under the hood to see how ...." 2. Can also imply that the implementation is
much simpler than the appearance would indicate: "Under the hood, we are just
fork/execing the shell." 3. Inside a chassis, as in "Under the hood, this
baby has a 40MHz 68030!" :undocumented feature: n. see {feature}.
:uninteresting: adj. 1. Said of a problem that, although {nontrivial}, can be
solved simply by throwing sufficient resources at it.
