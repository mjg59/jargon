 :brick: n. 1. A piece of equipment that has been programmed or configured
into a {hung}, {wedged},unusable state. Especially used to describe what
happens to devices like routers or PDAs that run from firmware when the
firmware image is damaged or its settings are somehow patched to impossible
values. This term usually implies irreversibility, but equipment can
sometimes be unbricked by performing a hard reset or some other drastic
operation. Sometimes verbed: "Yeah, I bricked the router because I forgot
about adding in the new access-list.". 2. An outboard power transformer of
the kind associated with laptops, modems, routers and other small computing
appliances, especially one of the modern type with cords on both ends, as
opposed to the older and obnoxious type that plug directly into wall or
barrier strip.
