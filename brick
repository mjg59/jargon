 :brick: n. A piece of equipment that has been programmed or configured into
a {hung}, {wedged},unusable state. Especially used to describe what happens
to devices like routers or PDAs that run from firmware when the firmware
image is damaged or its settings are somehow patched to impossible values.
This term usually implies irreversibility, but equipment can sometimes be
unbricked by performing a hard reset or some other drastic operation.
Sometimes verbed: "Yeah, I bricked the router because I forgot about adding
in the new access-list.".
