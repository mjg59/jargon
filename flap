 :flap: /vt./ 1. To unload a DECtape (so it goes flap, flap, flap...).
Old-time hackers at MIT tell of the days when the disk was device 0 and
{microtape}s were 1, 2,... and attempting to flap device 0 would instead
start a motor banging inside a cabinet near the disk. 2. By extension, to
unload any magnetic tape. see also {macrotape}. Modern cartridge tapes no
longer actually flap, but the usage has remained. (The term could well be
re-applied to DEC's TK50 cartridge tape drive, a spectacularly misengineered
contraption which makes a loud flapping sound, almost like an old reel-type
lawnmower, in one of its many tape-eating failure modes.)
