 :well-behaved: adj. 1. [primarily {{MS-DOS}}] Said of software conforming to
system interface guidelines and standards. Well-behaved software uses the
operating system to do chores such as keyboard input, allocating memory and
drawing graphics. Oppose {ill-behaved}. 2. Software that does its job quietly
and without counterintuitive effects. Esp. said of software having an
interface spec sufficiently simple and well-defined that it can be used as a
{tool} by other software. see {cat}. 3. Said of an algorithm that doesn't
{crash} or {blow up}, even when given {pathological} input. Implies that the
stability of the algorithm is intrinsic, which makes this somewhat different
from {bulletproof}.
