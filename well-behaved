 :well-behaved: adj. 1. Software that does its job quietly and without
counterintuitive effects. Esp.: said of software having an interface spec
sufficiently simple and well-defined that it can be used as a {tool} by other
software. see {cat}. 2. Said of an algorithm that doesn't {crash} or {blow
up}, even when given {pathological} input. Implies that the stability of the
algorithm is intrinsic, which makes this somewhat different from
{bulletproof}.
