 :foreground: vt. [Unix; common] To bring a task to the top of one's {stack}
for immediate processing, and hackers often use it in this sense for
non-computer tasks. "If your presentation is due next week, I guess I'd
better foreground writing up the design document." Technically, on a
timesharing system, a task executing in foreground is one able to accept
input from and return output to the user; oppose {background}. Nowadays this
term is primarily associated with {Unix}, but it appears first to have been
used in this sense on OS/360. Normally, there is only one foreground task per
terminal (or terminal window); having multiple processes simultaneously
reading the keyboard is a good way to {lose}.
