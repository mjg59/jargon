 FOREGROUND [UNIX] adj.v. On a time-sharing system, a task executing in
foreground is one running at normal priority and able to accept input from
and return output to the user; oppose BACKGROUND. There may be only one
forground task per terminal (or terminal window). By extension, "to
foreground" a task is to bring it to the top of one's PDL or STACK for
immediate processing, and in this sense hackers often use it for non-computer
tasks.
