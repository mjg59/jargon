 FOREGROUND [UNIX] adj.v. On a time-sharing system, a task executing in
foreground is one able to accept input from and return output to the user;
oppose BACKGROUND. Normally, there is only one foreground task per terminal
(or terminal window); having multiple processes simultaneously reading the
keyboard is a good way to LOSE. By extension, "to foreground" a task is to
bring it to the top of one's PDL or STACK for immediate processing, and in
this sense hackers often use it for non-computer tasks.
