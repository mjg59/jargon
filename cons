 :cons: /konz/ or /kons/ [from LISP] 1. /vt./ To add a new element to a
specified list, esp. at the top. "OK, cons picking a replacement for the
console TTY onto the agenda." 2. `cons up': /vt./ To synthesize from smaller
pieces: "to cons up an example". In LISP itself, `cons' is the most
fundamental operation for building structures. It takes any two objects and
returns a `dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each
branch. Because the result of a cons is an object, it can be used to build
binary trees of any shape and complexity. Hackers think of it as a sort of
universal constructor, and that is where the jargon meanings spring from.
