 :samizdat: n. [Russian, literally "self publishing"] The process of
disseminating documentation via underground channels. Originally referred to
underground duplication and distribution of banned books in the former Soviet
Union; now refers by obvious extension to any less-than-official promulgation
of textual material, esp. rare, obsolete, or never-formally-published
computer documentation. Samizdat is obviously much easier when one has access
to high-bandwidth networks and high-quality laser printers. Note that
samizdat is properly used only with respect to documents which contain needed
information (see also {hacker ethic, the}) but which are for some reason
otherwise unavailable, but *not* in the context of documents which are
available through normal channels, for which unauthorized duplication would
be unethical copyright violation. see {Lions Book} for a historical example.
