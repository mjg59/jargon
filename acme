 :Acme: n. [from Greek akme highest point of perfection or achievement] The
canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry --
where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who specialized in
elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been humorously expanded as A (or
American) Company Making Everything. (In fact, Acme was a real brand sold
from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the early 1900s.) Describing some X as an
"Acme X" either means "This is {insanely great}", or, more likely, "This
looks {insanely great} on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot
yourself in the foot with it." Compare {pistol}. This term, specially
cherished by American hackers and explained here for the benefit of our
overseas brethren, comes from the Warner Brothers' series of "Road-runner"
cartoons. In these cartoons, the famished Wile E. Coyote was forever
attempting to catch up with, trap, and eat the Road-runner. His attempts
usually involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices -- rocket
jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc. These were
usually delivered in large wooden crates labeled prominently with the Acme
name -- which, probably not by coincidence, was the trade name of the
animation rotation board used by cartoonists since forever. Acme devices
invariably malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways.
