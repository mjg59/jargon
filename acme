 :Acme: n. The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate and non-functional
gadgetry -- where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson shop. Describing some X as
an "Acme X" either means "This is {insanely great}", or, more likely, "This
looks {insanely great} on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot
yourself in the foot with it." Compare {pistol}. This term, specially
cherished by American hackers and explained here for the benefit of our
overseas brethren, comes from the Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner"
cartoons. In these cartoons, the famished Wyl E. Coyote was forever
attempting to catch up with, trap, and eat the Roadrunner. His attempts
usually involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices -- rocket
jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc. These were
usually delivered in large cardboard boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme
name. These devices invariably malfunctioned in violent and improbable ways.
