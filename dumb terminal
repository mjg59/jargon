 :dumb terminal: n. A terminal which is one step above a {glass tty}, having
a minimally-addressable cursor but no on-screen editing or other features
which are claimed by a {smart terminal}. Once upon a time, when glass ttys
were common and addressable cursors were something special, what is now
called a dumb terminal could pass for a smart terminal.
