 TEX /tekh/ n. An extremely powerful MACRO-based text-formatter written by
Donald E. Knuth, very popular in the computer-science community (it is good
enough to have displaced UNIX troff(1), the other favored formatter, even at
many UNIX installations). TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural)
pronunciation and mixed-case spelling (TeX) of the name. They like to
proliferate names from the word `TeX' --- such as TeXnichian (TeX user),
TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax,
TeXnique.
