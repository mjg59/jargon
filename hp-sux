 HP-SUX /aych pee suhx/ n. Unflattering hackerism for HP-UX,
Hewlett-Packard's UNIX port. Features some truly unique bogosities in the
filesystem internals and elsewhere that occasionally create portability
problems. HP-UX is often referred to as "hockey-pux" inside HP, and one
outside correspondent claims that the proper pronunciation is /aych-pee
ukkkhhhh/ as though one were spitting. see also TELERAT, SUN-STOOLS,
TERMINAK.
