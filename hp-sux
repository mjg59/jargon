 HP-SUX: /aych pee suhx/ n. Unflattering hackerism for HP-UX,
Hewlett-Packard's UNIX port. Features some truly unique bogosities in the
filesystem internals and elsewhere that occasionally create portability
problems. HP-UX is often referred to as "hockey-pux" inside HP, and one
respondent claims that the proper pronunciation is /aych-pee ukkkhhhh/ as
though one were spitting. Another such alternate spelling and pronunciation
is "H-PUX" /aych-puhks/. Hackers at HP/Apollo (the former Apollo Computer
that was swallowed by HP in 1989) have been heard to complain that Mr.
Packard should have pushed to have his name first, if for no other reason
than the greater eloquence of the resulting acronym. Compare {buglix}. see
also {Telerat}, {sun-stools}, {terminak}. huff: v. To compress data using a
Huffman code. Various programs that use such methods have been called `HUFF'
or some variant thereof. Oppose {puff}. Compare {crunch}, {compress}. humma:
excl. A filler word used on various `chat' and `talk' programs when you had
nothing to say but felt that it was important to say something. The word
apparently originated (at least with this definition) on the MECC Timeshare
System (MTS, a now-defunct educational time-sharing system running in
Minnesota during the 1970s and early '80s) but was later sighted on early
UNIX systems. Humor, Hacker:: n. A distinctive style of shared intellectual
humor found among hackers, having the following distinctive characteristics:
1) Fascination with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor having to do
with confusion of metalevels (see {meta}). One way to make a hacker laugh:
hold an red index card in front of him/her with "GREEN" written on it, or
vice-versa (note, however, that this is only funny the first time). 2)
Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs such as
specifications (see {write-only memory}), standards documents, language
descriptions (see {INTERCAL}), and even entire scientific theories (see
{quantum bogodynamics}, {computron}). 3) Jokes that involve screwily precise
reasoning from bizarre, ludicrous, or just grossly counter-intuitive
premises. 4) Fascination with puns and wordplay. 5) A fondness for apparently
mindless humor with subversive currents of intelligence in it, for example:
old Warner Brothers and Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons, The Marx Brothers, the
early B-52s, and Monty Python's Flying Circus. Humor which combines this
trait with elements of high camp and slapstick is especially favored. 6)
References to the symbol-object antinomies and associated ideas in Zen
Buddhism and (less often) Taoism. see {has the X nature}, {Discordianism},
{zen}, {ha ha only serious}, {AI koans}. see also {filk}, {retrocomputing},
and Appendix B. If you have an itchy feeling that all six of these traits are
really aspects of one thing that is incredibly difficult to talk about
exactly, you are (a) correct and (b) responding like a hacker. These traits
are also recognizable (though in a less marked form) throughout
{{Science-Fiction Fandom}}. hung: [from `hung up'] adj. Equivalent to
{wedged}. but more common at UNIX/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn.
with {locked up}, {wedged}; compare {hosed}. see also {hang}. A hung state is
distinguished from {crash}ed or {down}, where the program or system is also
unusable but because it is not running rather than because it is waiting for
something. However, the recovery from both situations is often the same.
hungry puppy: n. Syn. {slopsucker}. hungus: /huhng'g*s/ [perhaps related to
slang `humungous'] adj. Large, unwieldy, usually unmanageable. "TCP is a
hungus piece of code." "This is a hungus set of modifications." hyperspace:
(hie'per-spays) n. A memory location that is *far* away from where the
program counter should be pointing, often inaccessible because it is not even
mapped in. "Another core dump... looks like the program jumped off to
hyperspace somehow", (compare {jump off into never-never land}). This usage
is from the SF notion of a spaceship jumping `into hyperspace', that is,
taking a shortcut through higher-dimensional space --- in other words,
bypassing this universe. = I = =====
