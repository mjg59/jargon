 :Doom, X of: [common] A construction similar to `{Death, X of}, but derived
rather from the Cracks of Doom in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
The connotations are slightly different; a Foo of Death is mainly being held
up to ridicule, but one would have to take a Foo of Doom a bit more
seriously.
