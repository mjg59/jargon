 :loss: n. Something (not a person) that loses; a situation in which
something is losing. Emphatic forms include `moby loss', and `total loss',
`complete loss'. Common interjections are "What a loss!" and "What a moby
loss!" Note that `moby loss' is OK even though *`moby loser' is not used;
applied to an abstract noun, moby is simply a magnifier, whereas when applied
to a person it implies substance and has positive connotations. Compare
{lossage}.
