 :Lions Book: n. "Source Code and Commentary on Unix level 6", by John Lions.
The two parts of this book contained (1) the entire source listing of the
Unix Version 6 kernel, and (2) a commentary on the source discussing the
algorithms. These were circulated internally at the University of New South
Wales beginning 1976-77, and were, for years after, the _only_ detailed
kernel documentation available to anyone outside Bell Labs. Because Western
Electric wished to maintain trade secret status on the kernel, the Lions Book
was only supposed to be distributed to affiliates of source licensees. In
spite of this, it soon spread by {samizdat} to a good many of the early Unix
hackers. [1996 update: The Lions book lives again! It was put back in print
as ISBN 1-57398-013-7 from Peer-To-Peer Communications, with forewords by
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. In a neat bit of reflexivity, the page
before the contents quotes this entry.] [1998 update: John Lions's death was
an occasion of general mourning in the hacker community.]
