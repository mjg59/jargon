 :Lions Book: /n./ "Source Code and Commentary on Unix level 6", by John
Lions. The two parts of this book contained (1) the entire source listing of
the Unix Version 6 kernel, and (2) a commentary on the source discussing the
algorithms. These were circulated internally at the University of New South
Wales beginning 1976--77, and were, for years after, the *only* detailed
kernel documentation available to anyone outside Bell Labs. Because Western
Electric wished to maintain trade secret status on the kernel, the Lions Book
was only supposed to be distributed to affiliates of source licensees. In
spite of this, it soon spread by samizdat to a good many of the early Unix
hackers. [1996 update: The Lions book lives again! It will finally see legal
public print as ISBN 1-57398-013-7 from Peer-To-Peer Communications, with a
forward by Dennis Ritchie.]
