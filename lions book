 :Lions Book: n. "Source Code and Commentary on Unix level 6", by John Lions.
The two parts of this book contained (1) the entire source listing of the
Unix Version 6 kernel, and (2) a commentary on the source discussing the
algorithms. These were circulated internally at the University of New South
Wales beginning 1976--77, and were, for years after, the *only* detailed
kernel documentation available to anyone outside Bell Labs. Because Western
Electric wished to maintain trade secret status on the kernel, the Lions book
was never formally published and was only supposed to be distributed to
affiliates of source licensees (it is still possible to get a Bell Labs
reprint of the book by sending a copy of a V6 source license to the right
person at Bellcore, but *real* insiders have the UNSW edition). In spite of
this, it soon spread by samizdat to a good many of the early Unix hackers.
