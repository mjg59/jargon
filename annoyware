 :annoyware: n. A type of {shareware} that frequently disrupts normal program
operation to display requests for payment to the author in return for the
ability to disable the request messages. (Also called `nagware') The requests
generally require user action to acknowledge the message before normal
operation is resumed and are often tied to the most frequently used features
of the software. see also {careware}, {charityware}, {crippleware},
{freeware}, {FRS}, {guiltware}, {postcardware}, and {-ware}; compare
