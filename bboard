 :bboard: /bee'bord/ [contraction of `bulletin board'] n. 1. Any electronic
bulletin board; esp. used of {BBS} systems running on personal micros, less
frequently of a USENET {newsgroup} (in fact, use of this term for a newsgroup
generally marks one either as a {newbie} fresh in from the BBS world or as a
real old-timer predating USENET). 2. At CMU and other colleges with similar
facilities, refers to campus-wide electronic bulletin boards. 3. The term
`physical bboard' is sometimes used to refer to a old-fashioned,
non-electronic cork-and-thumbtack memo board. At CMU, it refers to a
particular one outside the CS Lounge. In either of senses 1 or 2, the term is
usually prefixed by the name of the intended board (`the Moonlight Casino
bboard' or `market bboard'); however, if the context is clear, the
better-read bboards may be referred to by name alone, as in (at CMU) "Don't
post for-sale ads on general".
