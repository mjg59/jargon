 :phreaking: /freek'ing/ n. [from `phone phreak'] 1. The art and science of
{cracking} the phone network (so as, for example, to make free long-distance
calls). 2. By extension, security-cracking in any other context (especially,
but not exclusively, on communications networks) (see {cracking}). At one
time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers; there was a
gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game and a form of
exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was taboo. There was
significant crossover between the hacker community and the hard-core phone
phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their own through such media as
the legendary "TAP Newsletter". This ethos began to break down in the
mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the techniques put them in the hands of
less responsible phreaks. Around the same time, changes in the phone network
made old-style technical ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so
phreaking came to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing
phone-card numbers. The crimes and punishments of gangs like the `414 group'
turned that game very ugly. A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just
to keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of `blue
boxes' or any of the other paraphernalia of the great phreaks of yore.
