 :flaky: /adj./ (var sp. `flakey') Subject to frequent {lossage}. This use is
of course related to the common slang use of the word to describe a person as
eccentric, crazy, or just unreliable. A system that is flaky is working, sort
of -- enough that you are tempted to try to use it -- but fails frequently
enough that the odds in favor of finishing what you start are low.
Commonwealth hackish prefers {dodgy} or {wonky}.
