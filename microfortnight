 :microfortnight: n. 1/1000000 of the fundamental unit of time in the
Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight system of measurement; 1.2096 sec. (A furlong is
1/8th of a mile; a firkin is 1/4th of a barrel; the mass unit of the system
is taken to be a firkin of water). The VMS operating system has a lot of
tuning parameters that you can set with the SYSGEN utility, and one of these
is TIMEPROMPTWAIT, the time the system will wait for an operator to set the
correct date and time at boot if it realizes that the current value is bogus.
This time is specified in microfortnights! Multiple uses of the
millifortnight (about 20 minutes) and {nanofortnight} have also been
reported.
