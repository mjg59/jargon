 :microfortnight: n. 1/1000000 of the fundamental unit of time in the
Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight system of measurement; 1.2096 sec. The VMS operating
system has a lot of tuning parameters that you can set with the SYSGEN
utility, and one of these is TIMEPROMPTWAIT, the time the system will wait
for an operator to set the correct date and time at boot if it realizes that
the current value is bogus. This time is specified in microfortnights!
Multiple uses of the millifortnight (about 20 minutes) and {nanofortnight}
have also been reported.
