 :Saturday-night special: /n./ [from police slang for a cheap handgun] A
{quick-and-dirty} program or feature kluged together during off hours, under
a deadline, and in response to pressure from a {salescritter}. Such hacks are
dangerously unreliable, but all too often sneak into a production release
after insufficient review.
