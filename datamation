 :Datamation: /day`t*-may'sh*n/ n. A magazine that many hackers assume all
{suit}s read. Used to question an unbelieved quote, as in "Did you read that
in `Datamation?'" (But see below; this slur may be dated by the time you read
this.) It used to publish something hackishly funny every once in a while,
like the original paper on {COME FROM} in 1973, and Ed Post's "Real
Programmers Don't Use Pascal" ten years later, but for a long time after that
it was much more exclusively {suit}-oriented and boring. Following a change
of editorship in 1994, Datamation is trying for more of the technical content
and irreverent humor that marked its early days. Datamation now has a WWW
page at `http://www.datamation.com' worth visiting for its selection of
computer humor, including "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" and the
`Bastard Operator From Hell' stories by Simon Travaglia (see {BOFH}).
