 :Datamation: /day`t*-may'sh*n/ n. A magazine that many hackers assume all
{suit}s read. Used to question an unbelieved quote, as in "Did you read that
in `Datamation?'" It used to publish something hackishly funny every once in
a while, like the original paper on {COME FROM} in 1973, and Ed Post's "Real
Programmers Don't Use Pascal" ten years later, but it has since become much
more exclusively {suit}-oriented and boring.
