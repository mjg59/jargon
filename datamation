 DATAMATION: n. A magazine that many hackers assume all {suits} read. Used to
question an unbelieved quote, as in "Did you read that in DATAMATION?". It
used to publish something hackishly funny every once in a while, like the
original paper on {COME FROM} in 1973; but since then it's become much more
exclusively {suit}-oriented. day mode: n. see {phase} (sense #1). Used of
people only.
