 :wank: /wangk/ [Columbia University: prob. by mutation from Commonwealth
slang v. `wank', to masturbate] n.,v. Used much as {hack} is elsewhere, as a
noun denoting a clever technique or person or the result of such cleverness.
May describe (negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake ("Quit
wanking, let's go get supper!") or (more positively) a {wizard}. Adj. `wanky'
describes something particularly clever (a person, program, or algorithm).
Conversations can also get wanky when there are too many wanks involved. This
excess wankiness is signalled by an overload of the `wankometer' (compare
{bogometer}). When the wankometer overloads, the conversation's subject must
be changed, or all non-wanks will leave. Compare `neep-neeping' (under
{neep-neep}). Usage: U.S. only. In Britain and the Commonwealth this word is
*extremely* rude and is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.
