 :UTSL: // /n./ [Unix] On-line acronym for `Use the Source, Luke' (a pun on
Obi-Wan Kenobi's "Use the Force, Luke!" in "Star Wars") -- analogous to
{RTFS} (sense 1), but more polite. This is a common way of suggesting that
someone would be better off reading the source code that supports whatever
feature is causing confusion, rather than making yet another futile pass
through the manuals, or broadcasting questions on Usenet that haven't
attracted {wizard}s to answer them. Once upon a time in {elder days},
everyone running Unix had source. After 1978, AT&T's policy tightened up, so
this objurgation was in theory appropriately directed only at associates of
some outfit with a Unix source license. In practice, bootlegs of Unix source
code (made precisely for reference purposes) were so ubiquitous that one
could utter it at almost anyone on the network without concern. Nowadays,
free Unix clones have become widely enough distributed that anyone can read
source legally. The most widely distributed is certainly Linux, with variants
of the NET/2 and 4.4BSD distributions running second. Cheap commercial Unixes
with source such as BSD/OS are accelerating this trend.
