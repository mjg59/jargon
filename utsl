 UTSL: // [UNIX] n. On-line acronym for `Use the Source, Luke' (a pun on
Obi-Wan Kenobi's "Use the Force, Luke!" in `Star Wars') --- analogous to
{RTFM} but more polite. This is a common way of suggesting that someone would
be best off reading the source code that supports whatever feature is causing
confusion, rather than making yet another futile pass through the manuals or
broadcasting questions that haven't attracted {wizard}s to answer them. In
theory, this is appropriately directed only at associates of some outfit with
a UNIX source license; in practice, bootlegs of UNIX source code (made
precisely for reference purposes) are so ubiquitous that one may utter this
at almost anyone on {the network} without concern. In the near future (this
written in 1991) source licenses may become even less important; after the
recent release of the Mach 3.0 microkernal, given the continuing efforts of
the {GNU} project, and with the 4.4BSD release on the horizon, complete free
source code for UNIX-clone toolsets and kernels should soon be widely
available.
