 WAITS: n. The mutant cousin of {TOPS-10} used on a handful of systems at
{SAIL} up to 1990. There was never an `official' expansion of WAITS (the name
itself having been arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was
frequently glossed as `West-Coast Alternative to ITS'. Though WAITS was less
visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the
two communities and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect
influence. The early screen modes of {EMACS}, for example, were directly
inspired by WAITS's `E' editor --- one of a family of editors which were the
first to do `real-time editing', in which the editing commands were invisible
and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting. The modern
style of multi-region windowing is said to have originated there, and WAITS
alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewehere played major roles in the developments
that led to the XEROX Star, the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations. {Bucky
bits} were also invented there --- thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC is a
WAITS legacy. One notable WAITS feature never duplicated elsewhere was a
news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter AP
and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also featured a
still-unusual level of support for what is now called `multimedia' computing,
allowing analog and video signals to be switched to programming terminals.
waldo: /wol'doh/ [From Robert A. Heinlein's story `Waldo'] 1. A waldo is a
mechanical agent, such as gripper arm, controlled by a human limb; when these
were developed for the nuclear industry in the mid-1940s they were named
after the invention described by Robert A. Heinlein in the story he wrote in
1942. Now known by the more generic term 'telefactoring', is of intense
interest to NASA for tasks like space station maintenance. 2. At Harvard
(particularly by Tom Cheatham and students) this is used instead of {foobar}
as a meta-syntactic variable and general nonsense word. see {foo}, {bar},
{foobar}, {quux}. walk: n.,vt. Traversal of an actual or {logical} data
structure, especially a linked-list data structure in {core}. see also
{codewalker}, {silly walk}, {clobber}. walking drives: n. An occasional
failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when they were huge,
clunky {washing machine}s. Those old {dinosaur} parts carried terrific
angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to `walk' across
a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of millimeters at a time.
There is a legend about a drive that walked over to the only door to the
computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in
order to get at it! Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of
drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a
slow seek in the other direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out
how to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive
models and held disk-drive races. wall: [WPI] interj. 1. An indication of
confusion, usually spoken with a quizzical tone. "Wall??" 2. A request for
further explication. Compare {octal forty}. It is said that "Wall?" really
came from `talking to a blank wall'. It was initially used in situations
where, after one carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you
blankly, clearly having understood nothing that was explained. One would then
throw out a "Hello, wall?" to elicit some sort of response from the
questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing "Wall?" themselves.
wall follower: n. A person or algorithm which compensates for lack of
sophistication or native stupidity by efficiently following procedures shown
to have been effective in the past. Used of an algorithm, this is not
necessarily pejorative; it recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the winning robot in
an early AI contest (named, of course, after the cocktail). Harvey
successfully solved mazes by keeping a `finger' on one wall and running till
it came out the other end. This was inelegant, but mathematically guaranteed
to work on simply-connected mazes --- and, in fact, Harvey outperformed more
sophisticated robots that tried to `learn' each maze by building an internal
representation of it. Used of humans, the term *is* pejorative and implies an
uncreative, bureaucratic, by-the-book mentality. see also {code grinder}.
wall time: n. (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world' time (what the clock
on the wall shows) as opposed to the system clock's idea of time. 2. The real
running time of a program, as opposed to the number of {clocks} required to
execute it (on a timesharing system these will differ, as no one program gets
all the {clocks}). wallpaper: n. 1. A file containing a listing (e.g.,
assembly listing) or transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all
or part of a login session. (The idea was that the paper for such listings
was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford, where it
was used as such to cover windows.) Usage: not often used now, esp. since
other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX).
However, the UNIX world doesn't have an equivalent term, so perhaps
{wallpaper} will take hold there. The term probably originated on ITS, where
the commands to begin and end transcript files were :WALBEG and :WALEND, with
default file WALL PAPER (the space was a path delimiter). 2. The background
pattern used on graphical workstations (this is jargon under the `Windows'
graphical user interface to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that
contains the wallpaper information before it is actually printed on paper.
(Even if you don't intend ever to produce a real paper copy of the file it is
still called a `wallpaper file'.) wango: /wang'goh/ n. Random bit-level
{grovel}ling going on in a system during some unspecified operation. Often
used in combination with mumble. For example: "You start with the `.o' file
and mumble-wango --- and it comes out a snazzy object-oriented executable."
wank: /wangk/ [Columbia University; prob. by mutation from Commonwealth slang
v. `wank', to masturbate] n.,v. Used much as {hack} is elsewhere, as a noun
denoting a clever technique or person or the result of such clevernes. May
describe (negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake ("Quit wanking,
let's go get supper!") or (more positively) a {wizard}. Adj. `wanky'
describes something particularly clever (a person, program, or algorithm).
Conversations can also get wanky when there are too many wanks involved. This
excess wankiness is signalled by an overload of the `wankometer' (compare
{bogometer}). When the wankometer overloads, the conversation's subject must
be changed, or all non-wanks will leave. Compare `neep-neeping' (under
{neep-neep}). Usage: U.S. only. In Britain and the Commonwealth this word is
*extremely* rude and best avoided unless one intends to give offense.
wannabee: [from a term recently used to describe Madonna fans who dress,
talk, and act like their idol; prob. originally from biker slang] n. A
would-be {hacker}. The connotations of this term differ sharply depending on
the age and exposure of the subject. Used of a person who is in or might be
entering {larval stage}, it's semi-approving; such wannabees can be annoying
but most hackers remember that they, too, were once such creatures. When used
of any professional programmer, CS academic, writer, or {suit}, it's
derogatory, implying that said person is trying to cuddle up to the hacker
mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a prayer of understanding what it's
all about. Overuse of terms from this File is often an indication of the
{wannabee} nature. Compare {newbie}. [Historical note: the wannabee
phenomenon has a bit different flavor now (1991) than it did ten or fifteen
years ago. When the people who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in
{larval stage}, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious and
unaffected by models known in popular culture --- communities formed
spontaneously around people who, *as individuals*, felt irresistibly drawn to
do hackerly things, and what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure,
skill-focused desire to become similarly wizardly. Those days of innocence
are gone forever; society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer
after 1980 included the elevation of hackers as a new kind of folk hero, and
the result is that some people semi-consciously set out to *be hackers* and
borrow hackish prestige by fitting the public hacker image. Fortunately, to
do this really well, one has to actually become a wizard. Nevertheless,
old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the
change; among other things, it gives them mixed feelings about the effects of
public compendia of lore like this one.] wart: n. A small, {crock}y {feature}
that sticks out of an otherwise {clean} design. Something conspicuous for
localized ugliness, especially a special-case exception to a general rule.
For example, in some versions of `csh(1)', single-quotes literalize every
character inside them except `!'. In ANSI C, the `??' syntax used for escapes
to foreign-language alphabets is a wart. see also {miswart}. washing machine:
n. Old-style 14-inch hard disks in floor-standing cabinets. So called because
of the size of the cabinet and the `top-loading' access to the media packs
--- and, of course, they were always set on `spin cycle'. The washing-machine
idiom transcends language barriers; it's even used in Russian hacker jargon.
see {walking drives}. The thick channel cables connecting these were called
`bit hoses' (see {hose}). water MIPS: n. Large, water-cooled machines of
either today's ECL-supercomputer flavor or yesterday's traditional
{mainframe} type. wave a dead chicken: v. To perform a ritual in the
direction of crashed software or hardware that one believes to be futile but
is nevertheless necessary so that others are satisfied that an appropriate
degree of effort has been expended. "I'll wave a dead chicken over the source
code, but I really think we've run into an OS bug." Compare {voodoo
programming}, {rain dance}. weasel: n. [Cambridge] A naive user, one who
deliberately or accidentally does things that are stupid or ill-advised.
Roughly synonymous with {loser}. wedged: [from a common description of
recto-cranial inversion] adj. 1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without
help. This is different from having crashed. If the system has crashed, then
it has become totally non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying
to do something but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few
things, but not be fully operational. For example, a process may become
wedged if it {deadlock}s with another. Being wedged is slightly milder than
being {hung}. see also {gronk}, {locked up}, {hosed}. 2. This term is
sometimes used to describe a {deadlock} condition. 3. Often refers to humans
suffering misconceptions. 4. [UNIX] Specifically used to describe the state
of a TTY left in a losing state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one
that has messed with the line discipline in some obscure way. wedgie:
[Fairchild] n. A bug. Prob. related to {wedged}. wedgitude: /wedj'i-t[y]ood/
n. The quality or state of being {wedged}. weeble: /weeb'l/ [Cambridge]
interj. Use to denote frustration, usually at amazing stupidity. "I stuck the
disk in upside down." "Weeble...." Compare {gurfle}. weeds: n. Refers to
development projects or algorithms that have no possible relevance or
practical application. Comes from `off in the weeds'. Used in phrases like
"lexical analysis for microcode is serious weeds...." At CDC/ETA before its
demise, the phrase `go off in the weeds' was equivalent to IBM's {branch to
Fishkill} and mainstream hackerdom's {jump off into never-never land}.
weenie: n. 1. The semicolon character, `;' (ASCII #b0111011). 2. When used
with a qualifier (for example, as in {UNIX weenie}, VMS weenie, IBM weenie)
can become either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone
of voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers
him/herself to be the same sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a
major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area indicated;
whether this is positive or negative depends on the hearer's judgement of how
the speaker feels about that area. see also {bigot}. Weenix: [ITS] n. A
derogatory term for {UNIX}, derived from {UNIX weenie}. According to one
noted ex-ITSer, it is "The operating system preferred by Unix Weenies:
"Typified by poor modularity, poor reliability, hard file deletion, no file
version numbers, case sensitivity everywhere, and users who believe that
these are all advantages." Some ITS fans behave as though they believe UNIX
stole a future that rightfully belonged to them. see {ITS}. well-behaved:
adj. 1. [primarily {MS-DOS}] Said of software conforming to system interface
guidelines and standards. Well behaved software uses the operating system to
do chores such as keyboard input, allocating memory and drawing graphics.
Oppose {ill-behaved}. 2. Software that does its job quietly and without
counterintuitive effects. Esp. said of software having an interface spec
sufficiently simple and well-defined that it can be used as a {tool} by other
software. well-connected: adj. Said of a computer installation, this means it
has reliable email links with the network and/or relays a large fraction of
available {USENET} newsgroups. `Well-known' can be almost synonymous, but
also implies that the site's name is familiar to many (due perhaps to an
archive service or active USENET users). wetware: [prob. from the novels of
Rudy Rucker] n. 1. The human nervous system, as opposed to computer hardware
or software (as in "Wetware has 7 plus or minus 2 temporary registers."). 2.
Human beings (programmers, operators, administrators) attached to a computer
system, as opposed to the system's hardware or software. wheel: n. 1. A
privilege bit that canonically allows the possessor to perform any operation
on a timesharing system, such as read or write any file on the system
regardless of protections, change or look at any address in the running
monitor, crash or reload the system, and kill/create jobs and user accounts.
The term was invented on the TENEX operating system, and carried over to
TOPS-20, XEROX-IFS and others. 2. A person who posses a wheel bit. "We need
to find a wheel to unwedge the hung tape drives." This term entered the UNIX
culture from TWENEX in the mid-80s and has been gaining popularity there
(esp. at university sites). Privilege bits are sometimes called `wheel bits'.
The state of being in a privileged logon is sometimes called `wheel mode'.
see also {root}. wheel wars: [Stanford University] A period in {larval stage}
during which student hacks hassle with each other by attempting to log each
other out of the system, delete each other's files, and otherwise wreak
havoc, usually at the expense of the lesser users. White Book: n. Syn. {K&R}.
whizzy: [Sun] adj. (alt. `wizzy') Describes a {cuspy} program; one that is
feature-rich and well presented.
