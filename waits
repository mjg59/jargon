 1. The use by guess or cookbook of an {obscure} or {hairy} system, feature,
or algorithm that one does not truly understand. The implication is that the
technique may not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why. Almost
synonymous with {black magic}, except that black magic typically isn't
documented and _nobody_ understands it. Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy
wizardry}, {rain dance}, {cargo cult programming}, {wave a dead chicken}. 2.
Things programmers do that they know shouldn't work but they try anyway, and
which sometimes actually work, such as recompiling everything. :VR: // [MUD]
n. On-line abbrev for {virtual reality}, as opposed to {RL}. :Vulcan nerve
pinch: n. [from the old "Star Trek" TV series via Commodore Amiga hackers]
The keyboard combination that forces a soft-boot or jump to ROM monitor (on
machines that support such a feature). On PC clones this is Ctrl-Alt-Del; on
Suns, L1-A; on Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch> or
<CMD>-<CTRL>-<POWER>! Also called {three-finger salute}. Compare {quadruple
bucky}. :vulture capitalist: n. Pejorative hackerism for `venture
capitalist', deriving from the common practice of pushing contracts that
deprive inventors of control over their own innovations and most of the money
they ought to have made from them. = W = ===== :W2K bug: [from `Y2K bug' for
the Year 2000 problem] The upcoming deployment of Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system, which hackers generally expect will be among the worst
train wrecks in the history of software engineering. Such is the power of
Microsoft marketing, however, that it is also expected this will not become
obvious until it has incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in downtime and
lost opportunity costs. :wabbit: /wab'it/ n. [almost certainly from Elmer
Fudd's immortal line "You wascawwy wabbit!"] 1. A legendary early hack
reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere around 1978; this may have
descended (if only by inspiration) from a hack called RABBITS reported from
1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the University of Washington Computer Center. The
program would make two copies of itself every time it was run, eventually
crashing the system. 2. By extension, any hack that includes infinite
self-replication but is not a {virus} or {worm}. see {fork bomb} and {rabbit
job}, see also {cookie monster}. :WAITS:: /wayts/ n. The mutant cousin of
{{TOPS-10}} used on a handful of systems at {{SAIL}} up to 1990. There was
never an `official' expansion of WAITS (the name itself having been arrived
at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently glossed as
`West-coast Alternative to ITS'. Though WAITS was less visible than ITS,
there was frequent exchange of people and ideas between the two communities,
and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted enormous indirect influence. The
early screen modes of {EMACS}, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS's
`E' editor -- one of a family of editors that were the first to do `real-time
editing', in which the editing commands were invisible and where one typed
text at the point of insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region
windowing is said to have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC
and elsewhere played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX
Star, the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations. Also invented there were
{bucky bits} -- thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy. One
WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a news-wire interface that
allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter AP and UPI dispatches from
their terminals; the system also featured a still-unusual level of support
for what is now called `multimedia' computing, allowing analog audio and
video signals to be switched to programming terminals. :waldo: /wol'doh/ n.
