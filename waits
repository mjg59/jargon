 :WAITS:: /wayts/ n. The mutant cousin of {{TOPS-10}} used on a handful of
systems at {{SAIL}} up to 1990. There was never an `official' expansion of
WAITS (the name itself having been arrived at by a rather sideways process),
but it was frequently glossed as `West-coast Alternative to ITS'. Though
WAITS was less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and
ideas between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted
enormous indirect influence. The early screen modes of {EMACS}, for example,
were directly inspired by WAITS's `E' editor --- one of a family of editors
that were the first to do `real-time editing', in which the editing commands
were invisible and where one typed text at the point of
insertion/overwriting. The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to
have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere played
major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star, the Macintosh,
and the Sun workstations. {Bucky bits} were also invented there --- thus, the
ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS legacy. One notable WAITS feature seldom
duplicated elsewhere was a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to
read, store, and filter AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the
system also featured a still-unusual level of support for what is now called
`multimedia' computing, allowing analog audio and video signals to be
switched to programming terminals.
