 :star out: /v./ [University of York, England] To replace a user's encrypted
password in /etc/passwd with a single asterisk. Under Unix this is not a
legal encryption of any password; hence the user is not permitted to log in.
In general, accounts like adm, news, and daemon are permanently "starred
out"; occasionally a real user might have the this inflicted upon him/her as
a punishment, e.g. "Graham was starred out for playing Omega in working
hours". Also occasionally known as The Order Of The Gold Star in this
context. "Don't do that, or you'll be awarded the Order of the Gold Star..."
Compare {disusered}.
