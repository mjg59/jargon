 :nethack: /net'hak/ /n./ [Unix] A dungeon game similar to {rogue} but more
elaborate, distributed in C source over {Usenet} and very popular at Unix
sites and on PC-class machines (nethack is probably the most widely
distributed of the freeware dungeon games). The earliest versions, written by
Jay Fenlason and later considerably enhanced by Andries Brouwer, were simply
called `hack'. The name changed when maintenance was taken over by a group of
hackers originally organized by Mike Stephenson; the current contact address
(as of early 1996) is nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu.
