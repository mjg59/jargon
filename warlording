 :warlording: v. [from the Usenet group alt.fan.warlord] The act of
excoriating a bloated, ugly, or derivative {sig block}. Common grounds for
warlording include the presence of a signature rendered in a {BUAF},
over-used or cliched {sig quote}s, ugly {ASCII art}, or simply excessive
size. The original `Warlord' was a {B1FF}-like {newbie} c.1991 who featured
in his sig a particularly large and obnoxious ASCII graphic resembling the
sword of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius movie; the group name
alt.fan.warlord was sarcasm, and the characteristic mode of warlording is
devastatingly sarcastic praise. see also {McQuary limit}.
