 :Unix conspiracy: n. [ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular
among {ITS} and {TOPS-20} fans, Unix's growth is the result of a plot,
hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs, whose intent was to hobble AT&T's
competitors by making them dependent upon a system whose future evolution was
to be under AT&T's control. This would be accomplished by disseminating an
operating system that is apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also
relatively unreliable and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from
AT&T). This theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper
referenced in the {back door} entry. In this view, Unix was designed to be
one of the first computer viruses (see {virus}) -- but a virus spread to
computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
through disks and networks. Adherents of this `Unix virus' theory like to
cite the fact that the well-known quotation "Unix is snake oil" was uttered
by {DEC} president Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting
its own family of Unix workstations. (Olsen now claims to have been
misquoted.) If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
plotters' control after 1990. AT&T sold its Unix operation to Novell around
the same time {Linux} and other free-Unix distributions were beginning to
make noise.
