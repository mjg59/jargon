 :dangling pointer: n. [common] A reference that doesn't actually lead
anywhere (in C and some other languages, a pointer that doesn't actually
point at anything valid). Usually this happens because it formerly pointed to
something that has moved or disappeared. Used as jargon in a generalization
of its techspeak meaning; for example, a local phone number for a person who
has since moved to the other coast is a dangling pointer.
