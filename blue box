 :blue box: n. 1. obs. Once upon a time, before all-digital switches made it
possible for the phone companies to move them out of band, one could actually
hear the switching tones used to route long-distance calls. Early {phreaker}s
built devices called `blue boxes' that could reproduce these tones, which
could be used to commandeer portions of the phone network. (This was not as
hard as it may sound; one early phreak acquired the sobriquet `Captain
Crunch' after he proved that he could generate switching tones with a plastic
whistle pulled out of a box of Captain Crunch cereal!) There were other
colors of box with more specialized phreaking uses; red boxes, black boxes,
silver boxes, etc. There were boxes of other colors
(http://www.ElfQrin.com/docs/hakref/phrkbox/phreakboxes.html) as well, but
the blue box was the original and archetype. 2. n. An {IBM} machine,
especially a large (non-PC) one.
