 PARSE [from linguistic terminology via AI research] v. 1. To determine the
syntactic structure of a sentence or other utterance (close to the standard
English meaning). Example: "That was the one I saw you." "I can't parse
that." 2. More generally, to understand or comprehend. "It's very simple; you
just kretch the glims and then aos the zotz." "I can't parse that." 3. Of
fish, to have to remove the bones yourself (usually at a Chinese restaurant).
"I object to parsing fish" means "I don't want to get a whole fish, but a
sliced one is okay." A "parsed fish" has been deboned. There is some
controversy over whether "unparsed" should mean "bony", or also mean
"deboned".
