 :parse: [from linguistic terminology] vt. 1. To determine the syntactic
structure of a sentence or other utterance (close to the standard English
meaning). "That was the one I saw you." "I can't parse that." 2. More
generally, to understand or comprehend. "It's very simple; you just kretch
the glims and then aos the zotz." "I can't parse that." 3. Of fish, to have
to remove the bones yourself. "I object to parsing fish", means "I don't want
to get a whole fish, but a sliced one is okay". A `parsed fish' has been
deboned. There is some controversy over whether `unparsed' should mean
`bony', or also mean `deboned'.
