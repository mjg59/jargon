 :demented: adj. Yet another term of disgust used to describe a
malfunctioning program. The connotation in this case is that the program
works as designed, but the design is bad. Said, for example, of a program
that generates large numbers of meaningless error messages, implying that it
is on the brink of imminent collapse. Compare {wonky}, {brain-damaged},
{bozotic}.
