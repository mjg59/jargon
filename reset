 :reset: [the MUD community] v. In AberMUD, to bring all dead mobiles to life
and move items back to their initial starting places. New players who can't
find anything shout "Reset! Reset!" quite a bit. Higher-level players shout
back "No way!" since they know where points are to be found. Used in {RL}, it
means to put things back to the way they were when you found them.
