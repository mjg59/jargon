 SECOND-SYSTEM EFFECT n. When designing the successor to a relatively small,
elegant and successful system, there is a tendency to become grandiose in
one's success and perpetrate an ELEPHANTINE feature-laden monstrosity. The
term was first used by Fred Brooks in his classic book "The Mythical
Man-Month". It described the jump from a set of nice, simple, operating
monitors on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360 series.
