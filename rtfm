 RTFM /ahr-tee-ef-em/ [UNIX] Abbrev. for "Read The Fucking Manual". 1. Used
by GURUs to brush off questions they consider trivial or annoying. Compare
DON'T DO THAT, THEN. 2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you
aren't just asking out of RANDOMNESS. "No, I can't figure out how to
interface UNIX to my toaster and yes I have RTFM." Unlike sense #1 this use
is considered polite.
