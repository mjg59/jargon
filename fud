 FUD wars: /fuhd worz/ n. [from {FUD}] Political posturing engaged in by
hardware and software vendors ostensibly committed to standardization but
actually willing to fragment the market to protect their own shares. The UNIX
International vs. OSF conflict is but one outstanding example. fudge: 1. vt.
To perform in an incomplete but marginally acceptable way, particularly with
respect to the writing of a program. "I didn't feel like going through that
pain and suffering, so I fudged it --- I'll fix it later." 2. n. The
resulting code. fudge factor: n. A value or parameter that is varied in an ad
hoc way to produce the desired result. The terms `tolerance' and {slop} are
also used, though these usually indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer
that is made larger than necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large
it needs to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to lose
completely for not having enough. A fudge factor, on the other hand, can
often be tweaked in more than one direction. A good example is the `fuzz'
typically allowed in floating-point calculations: two numbers being compared
for equality must be allowed to differ by a small amount; if that amount is
too small, a computation may never terminate, while if it is too large,
results will be needlessly inaccurate. Fudge factors are frequently adjusted
incorrectly by programmers who don't fully understand their import. see also
{coefficient of X}. fuel up: vi. To eat or drink hurriedly in order to get
back to hacking. "Food-p?" "Yeah, let's fuel up." "Time for a {great-wall}!"
see also {{oriental food}}. fuggly: /fuhg'lee/ adj. Emphatic form of {funky};
funky + ugly). Unusually for hacker jargon, this may actually derive from
black street-jive. To say it properly, the first syllable should be growled
rather than spoken. Usage: humorous. "Man, the {{ASCII}}-to-{{EBCDIC}} code
in that printer driver is *fuggly*." see also {wonky}. funky: adj. Said of
something that functions, but in a slightly strange, klugey way. It does the
job and would be difficult to change, so its obvious non-optimality is left
alone. Often used to describe interfaces. The more bugs something has that
nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds are easier, the funkier it is.
{TECO} and UUCP are funky. The Intel i860's exception handling is
extraordinarily funky. Most standards acquire funkiness as they age. "The new
mailer is installed, but is still somewhat funky; if it bounces your mail for
no reason, try resubmitting it." "This UART is pretty funky. The data ready
line is active-high in interrupt mode and active-low in DMA mode." see
{fuggly}. funny money: n. 1. Notional `dollar' units of computing time and/or
storage handed to students at the beginning of a computer course; also called
`play money' or `purple money' (in implicit opposition to real or `green'
money). When your funny money ran out, your account froze and you needed to
go to a professor to get more. Fortunately, the plunging cost of timesharing
cycles has made this less common. The amounts allocated were almost
invariably too small, even for the non-hackers who wanted to slide by with
minimum work. In extreme cases, the practice led to small-scale black markets
in bootlegged computer accounts. 2. By extension, phantom money or quantity
tickets of any kind used as a resource-allocation hack within a system.
Antonym: `real money'. fuzzball: [TCP/IP hackers] n. A DEC LSI-11 running a
particular suite of homebrewed software written by Dave Mills and assorted
co-conspirators, used in the early 1980s for Internet protocol testbedding
and experimentation. These were used as NSFnet backbone sites in its early
56KB-line days; a few are still active on the Internet as of early 1991,
doing odd jobs such as network time service. = G = ===== G: [SI] pref.,suff.
see {{quantifiers}}. gabriel: /gay'bree-*l/ [for Dick Gabriel, SAIL LISP
hacker and volleyball fanatic] n. An unnecessary (in the opinion of the
opponent) stalling tactic, e.g., tying one's shoelaces or combing one's hair
repeatedly, asking the time, etc. Also used to refer to the perpetrator of
such tactics. Also, `pulling a Gabriel', `Gabriel mode'. gag: vi. Equivalent
to {choke}, but connotes more disgust. "Hey, this is FORTRAN code. No wonder
the C compiler gagged." see also {barf}. gang bang: n. The use of large
numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an attempt to wedge a great many
features into a product in a short time. Though there have been memorable
gang bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler port mentioned in Steven
Levy's `Hackers'), most are perpetrated by large companies trying to meet
deadlines and produce enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in
{orthogonal}ity. When market-driven managers make a list of all the features
the competition has and assign one programmer to implement each, they often
miss the importance of maintaining a coherent design. see also
{firefighting}, {Mongolian Hordes technique}, {Conway's Law}. garbage
collect: vi. (also `garbage collection', n.) see {GC}. garply: /gar'plee/
[Stanford] n. Another meta-syntactic variable (see {foo}); once popular among
SAIL hackers. gas: [as in `gas chamber'] 1. interj. A term of disgust and
hatred, implying that gas should be dispensed in generous quantities, thereby
exterminating the source of irritation. "Some loser just reloaded the system
for no reason! Gas!" 2. interj. A suggestion that someone or something ought
to be flushed out of mercy. "The system's getting {wedged} every few minutes.
Gas!" 3. vt. To {flush} (sense 1). "You should gas that old crufty software."
4. [IBM] n. Dead space in nonsequentially organized files that was occupied
by data that has been deleted; the compression operation that removes it is
called `degassing' (by analogy, perhaps, with the use of the same term in
vacuum technology). 5. [IBM] n. Empty space on a disk that has been
clandestinely allocated against future need. gaseous: adj. Deserving of being
{gas}sed. Disseminated by Geoff Goodfellow while at SRI; became particularly
popular after the Moscone-Milk killings in San Francisco, when it was learned
that the defendant Dan White (a politician who had supported Proposition 7)
would get the gas chamber under Proposition 7 if convicted of first-degree
murder (he was eventually convicted of manslaughter).
