 :FUD: /fuhd/ n. Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found his own
company: "FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people
instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering [Amdahl]
products." The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go with safe IBM gear
rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was
traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to
people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of
competitors' equipment or software. see {IBM}. After 1990 the term FUD was
associated increasingly frequently with {Microsoft}, and has become
generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a competitive
weapon.
