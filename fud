 FUD wars: /fuhd worz/ n. [from {FUD}] Political posturing engaged in by
hardware and software vendors ostensibly committed to standardization but
actually willing to fragment the market to protect their own shares. The OSF
vs. UNIX International conflict, for example. fudge: 1. vt. To perform in an
incomplete but marginally acceptable way, particularly with respect to the
writing of a program. "I didn't feel like going through that pain and
suffering, so I fudged it." 2. n. The resulting code. fudge factor: n. A
value or parameter that is varied in an ad hoc way to produce the desired
result. The terms `tolerance' and {slop} are also used, though these usually
indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer that is made larger than
necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large it needs to be, and it is
better to waste a little space than to lose completely for not having enough.
A fudge factor, on the other hand, can often be tweaked in more than one
direction. A good example is the {fuzz} typically needed in floating-point
calculations: two numbers being compared for equality must be allowed to
differ by a small amount; if that amount is too small, a computation may
never terminate, while if it is too large, results will be needlessly
inaccurate. Fudge factors are frequently adjusted incorrectly by programmers
who don't fully understand their import. see also {coefficient of x}. fuel
up: vi. To eat or drink hurriedly in order to get back to hacking. "Food-p?"
"Yeah, let's fuel up." "Time for a {great-wall}!". see also {{Oriental
Food}}. fuggly: /fuhg'lee/ adj. Emphatic form of {funky}; funky + ugly (or
possibly a contraction of `fuckin' ugly'). Unusually for hacker slang, this
may actually derive from black street-jive. To say it properly, the first
syllable should be growled rather than spoken. Usage: humorous. "Man, the
ASCII-to-{EBCDIC} code in that printer driver is *fuggly*." see also {wonky}.
funky: adj. Said of something which functions, but in a slightly strange,
klugey way. It does the job and would be difficult to change, so its obvious
non-optimality is left alone. Often used to describe interfaces. The more
bugs something has that nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds are
easier, the funkier it is. {TECO} and UUCP are funky. The Intel i860's
exception handling is extraordinarily funky. Most standards acquire funkiness
as they age. "The new mailer is installed, but is still somewhat funky; if it
bounces your mail for no reason, try resubmitting it." "This UART is pretty
funky. The data ready line is active-high in interrupt mode, and active-low
in DMA mode." see {fuggly}. funny money: n. 1. Notional `dollar' units of
computing time and/or storage handed to students at the beginning of a
computer course by professors; also called `play money' or `purple money' (in
implicit opposition to real or `green' money). When your funny money ran out,
your account froze and you needed to go to a professor to get more. Formerly
a common practice, this has now been made sufficiently rare by the plunging
cost of timesharing cycles that it has become folklore. The amounts allocated
were almost invariably too small, even for the non-hackers who wanted to
slide by with minimum work. In extreme cases, the practice led to small-scale
black markets in bootlegged computer accounts. 2. By extension, phantom money
or quantity tickets of any kind used as a resource-allocation hack within a
system. Antonym: `real money'. fuzz: n. In floating-point arithmetic, the
maximum difference allowed between two quantities for them to compare equal.
Has to be set properly relative to the FPU's precision limits. see {fudge
factor}. fuzzball: [TCP/IP hackers] n. A DEC LSI-11 running a particular
suite of homebrewed software by Dave Mills and assorted co-conspirators, used
in the early 1980s for Internet protocol testbedding and experimentation.
These were used as NSFnet backbone sites in its early 56KB-line days; a few
of these are still active on the Internet as of early 1990, doing odd jobs
such as network time service. = G = ===== gabriel: /gay'bree-@l/ [for Dick
Gabriel, SAIL LISP hacker and volleyball fanatic] n. An unnecessary (in the
opinion of the opponent) stalling tactic, e.g., tying one's shoelaces or hair
repeatedly, asking the time, etc. Also used to refer to the perpetrator of
such tactics. Also, `pulling a Gabriel', `Gabriel mode'. gag: vi. Equivalent
to {choke}, but connotes more disgust. "Hey, this is FORTRAN code. No wonder
the C compiler gagged." see also {barf}. gang bang: n. The use of large
numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an attempt to wedge a great many
features into a product in a short time. While there have been memorable gang
bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler port mentioned in Steven Levy's
`Hackers'), most are perpetrated by large companies trying to meet deadlines
and produce enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in orthogonality
(see {orthogonal}). When market-driven managers make a list of all the
features the competition has and assign one programmer to implement each,
they often miss the importance of maintaining strong invariants, like
relational integrity. see also {firefighting}, {Mongolian Hordes technique}.
garbage collect: vi. (also `garbage collection', n.) see {GC}. garply:
/gar'plee/ n. [Stanford] Another meta-syntactic variable (see {foo}) popular
among SAIL hackers. gas: [as in `gas chamber'] interj. 1. A term of disgust
and hatred, implying that gas should be dispensed in generous quantities,
thereby exterminating the source of irritation. "Some loser just reloaded the
system for no reason! Gas!" 2. A term suggesting that someone or something
ought to be flushed out of mercy. "The system's wedging every few minutes.
Gas!" 3. vt. To {flush}. "You should gas that old crufty software." 4.
GASEOUS adj. Deserving of being gassed. Usage: primarily used by Geoff
Goodfellow at SRI, but spreading; became particularly popular after the
Moscone/Milk murders in San Francisco, when it was learned that Dan White
(who supported Proposition 7) would get the gas chamber under 7 if convicted.
He was eventually found not guilty by reason of insanity. 5. [IBM] Dead space
in nonsequentially organized files that was occupied by data that has been
deleted; the compression operation that removes it is called `degassing' (by
analogy, perhaps, with the technical term `degaussing').
