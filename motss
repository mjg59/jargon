 MOTSS: /mots/ or /M-O-T-S-S/ [from the 1970 U.S. census forms via USENET,
Member Of The Same Sex] n. Esp. one considered as a possible sexual partner.
The gay-issues newsgroup on USENET is called soc.motss. see {MOTOS} and
{MOTAS}, which derive from it. Also see {SO}. mouse ahead: vi.
Point-and-click analog of `type ahead'. To manipulate a computer's pointing
device (almost always a mouse in this usage, but not necessarily) and its
selection or command buttons before a computer program is ready to accept
such input, in anticipation of the program accepting the input. Handling this
properly is rare, but it can help make a {WIMP environment} much more usable,
assuming the users are familiar with the behavior of the user interface.
mouse around: vi. To explore public portions of a large system, esp. a
network such as Internet via {FTP} or {TELNET}, looking for interesting stuff
to {snarf}. mouse belt: n. see {rat belt}. mouse droppings: [MS-DOS] n.
Pixels (usually single) that are not properly restored when the mouse pointer
moves away from a particular location on the screen, producing the appearance
that the mouse pointer has left droppings behind. The major causes for this
problem are programs that write to the screen memory corresponding to the
mouse pointer's current location without hiding the mouse pointer first, and
mouse drivers that do not quite support the graphics mode in use. mouse
elbow: n. A tennis-elbow-like fatigue syndrome resulting from excessive use
of a {WIMP environment}. Similarly, `mouse shoulder'; GLS reports that he
used to get this a lot before he taught himself to be ambimoustrous. mouso:
/mow'soh/ n. [by analogy with `typo'] An error in mouse usage resulting in an
inappropriate selection or graphic garbage on the screen. Compare {thinko},
{braino}.
