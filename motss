USENET, Member Of The Same Sex] n. Esp. one considered as a possible sexual
partner, e.g. by a gay male or lesbian. The gay-issues newsgroup on USENET is
called `soc.motss'. see {MOTOS} and {MOTAS}, which derive from it. Also see
{SO}. mouse ahead: vi. To manipulate a computer's pointing device (almost
always a mouse in this usage, but not necessarily) and its selection or
command buttons before a computer program is ready to accept such input, in
anticipation of the program accepting the input. Handling this properly is
rare, but it can help make a {user-friendly} program usable by real users,
assuming they are familiar with the behavior of the user interface.
Point-and-click analog of `type ahead'. mouse around: vi. To explore public
portions of a large system, esp. a network such as Internet via {FTP} or
{TELNET}, looking for interesting stuff to {snarf}. mouse elbow: n. A
tennis-elbow-like fatigue syndrome resulting from excessive use of a {WIMP
environment}. Similarly, `mouse shoulder'; GLS reports that he used to get
this a lot before he taught himself to be ambimousterous. mouso: /mow'soh/ n.
[by analogy with `typo'] An error in mouse usage resulting in an
inappropriate selection or graphic garbage on the screen. Compare {thinko}.
