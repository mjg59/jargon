 X-window interface with over 200 buttons; and all monty actually _did_ was
{FTP} files off the network. 2. [Great Britain; commonly capitalized as
`Monty' or as `the Full Monty'] 16 megabytes of memory, when fitted to an
IBM-PC or compatible. A standard PC-compatible using the AT- or ISA-bus with
a normal BIOS cannot access more than 16 megabytes of RAM. Generally used of
a PC, Unix workstation, etc. to mean `fully populated with' memory,
disk-space or some other desirable resource. This usage may be related to a
TV commercial for Del Monte fruit juice, in which one of the characters
insisted on "the full Del Monte"; but see the World Wide Words article "The
Full Monty" (http://clever.net/quinion/words/articles/monty.htm) for
discussion of the rather complex etymology that may lie behind this. Compare
American {moby}. :Moof: /moof/ [Macintosh users] 1. n. The call of a
semi-legendary creature, properly called the {dogcow}. (Some previous
versions of this entry claimed, incorrectly, that Moof was the name of the
_creature_.) 2. adj. Used to flag software that's a hack, something untested
and on the edge. On one Apple CD-ROM, certain folders such as "Tools & Apps
(Moof!)" and "Development Platforms (Moof!)", are so marked to indicate that
they contain software not fully tested or sanctioned by the powers that be.
When you open these folders you cross the boundary into hackerland. 3. v. On
the Microsoft Network, the term `moof' has gained popularity as a verb
meaning `to be suddenly disconnected by the system'. One might say "I got
moofed". :Moore's Law: /morz law/ prov. The observation that the logic
density of silicon integrated circuits has closely followed the curve (bits
per square inch) = 2^(t - 1962) where t is time in years; that is, the amount
of information storable on a given amount of silicon has roughly doubled
every year since the technology was invented. This relation, first uttered in
1964 by semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years
later) held until the late 1970s, at which point the doubling period slowed
to 18 months. The doubling period remained at that value through time of
writing (late 1999). Moore's Law is apparently self-fulfilling. The
implication is that somebody, somewhere is going to be able to build a better
chip then you if you rest on your laurels, so you'd better start pushing hard
on the problem. see also {Parkinson's Law of Data}. :moose call: n. see
{whalesong}. :moria: /mor'ee-*/ n. Like {nethack} and {rogue}, one of the
large PD Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation games, available for a wide
range of machines and operating systems. The name is from Tolkien's Mines of
Moria; compare {elder days}, {elvish}. The game is extremely addictive and a
major consumer of time better used for hacking. :MOTAS: /moh-tahz/ n.
[Usenet: Member Of The Appropriate Sex, after {MOTOS} and {MOTSS}] A
potential or (less often) actual sex partner. see also {SO}. :MOTOS:
/moh-tohs/ n. [acronym from the 1970 U.S. census forms via Usenet: Member Of
The Opposite Sex] A potential or (less often) actual sex partner. see
{MOTAS}, {MOTSS}, {SO}. Less common than MOTSS or {MOTAS}, which has largely
displaced it. :MOTSS: /mots/ or /M-O-T-S-S/ n. [from the 1970 U.S. census
forms via Usenet] Member Of The Same Sex, esp. one considered as a possible
sexual partner. The gay-issues newsgroup on Usenet is called soc.motss. see
{MOTOS} and {MOTAS}, which derive from it. see also {SO}. :mouse ahead: vi.
Point-and-click analog of `type ahead'. To manipulate a computer's pointing
device (almost always a mouse in this usage, but not necessarily) and its
selection or command buttons before a computer program is ready to accept
such input, in anticipation of the program accepting the input. Handling this
properly is rare, but it can help make a {WIMP environment} much more usable,
assuming the users are familiar with the behavior of the user interface.
:mouse around: vi. To explore public portions of a large system, esp. a
network such as Internet via {FTP} or {TELNET}, looking for interesting stuff
to {snarf}. :mouse belt: n. see {rat belt}. :mouse droppings: n. [MS-DOS]
Pixels (usually single) that are not properly restored when the mouse pointer
moves away from a particular location on the screen, producing the appearance
that the mouse pointer has left droppings behind. The major causes for this
problem are programs that write to the screen memory corresponding to the
mouse pointer's current location without hiding the mouse pointer first, and
mouse drivers that do not quite support the graphics mode in use. :mouse
elbow: n. A tennis-elbow-like fatigue syndrome resulting from excessive use
of a {WIMP environment}. Similarly, `mouse shoulder'; GLS reports that he
used to get this a lot before he taught himself to be ambimoustrous. :mouso:
/mow'soh/ n. [by analogy with `typo'] An error in mouse usage resulting in an
inappropriate selection or graphic garbage on the screen. Compare {thinko},
{braino}. :MS-DOS:: /M-S-dos/ n. [MicroSoft Disk Operating System] A {clone}
of {{CP/M}} for the 8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by hacker Tim Paterson
at Seattle Computer Products, who called the original QDOS (Quick and Dirty
Operating System) and is said to have regretted it ever since. Microsoft
licensed QDOS order to have something to demo for IBM on time, and the rest
is history. Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but rather broken
support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and pipelines, were hacked into
Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result, there are two or more
incompatible versions of many system calls, and MS-DOS programmers can never
agree on basic things like what character to use as an option switch or
whether to be case-sensitive. The resulting appalling mess is now the
highest-unit-volume OS in history. Often known simply as DOS, which annoys
people familiar with other similarly abbreviated operating systems (the name
goes back to the mid-1960s, when it was attached to IBM's first disk
operating system for the 360). The name further annoys those who know what
the term {operating system} does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly
a set of relatively simple interrupt services. Some people like to pronounce
DOS like "dose", as in "I don't work on dose, man!", or to compare it to a
dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide circulation among
hackers exhorts: "MS-DOS: Just say No!"). see {mess-dos}, {ill-behaved}. :mu:
/moo/ The correct answer to the classic trick question "Have you stopped
beating your wife yet?". Assuming that you have no wife or you have never
beaten your wife, the answer "yes" is wrong because it implies that you used
to beat your wife and then stopped, but "no" is worse because it suggests
that you have one and are still beating her. According to various Discordians
and Douglas Hofstadter the correct answer is usually "mu", a Japanese word
alleged to mean "Your question cannot be answered because it depends on
incorrect assumptions". Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies
in language, and many have adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm. The word
`mu' is actually from Chinese, meaning `nothing'; it is used in mainstream
Japanese in that sense, but native speakers do not recognize the Discordian
question-denying use. It almost certainly derives from overgeneralization of
the answer in the following well-known Rinzei Zen {koan}: A monk asked Joshu,
"Does a dog have the Buddha nature?" Joshu retorted, "Mu!" see also {has the
X nature}, {Some AI Koans}, and Douglas Hofstadter's "Go"del, Escher, Bach:
An Eternal Golden Braid" (pointer in the {Bibliography} in Appendix C. :MUD:
/muhd/ n. [acronym, Multi-User Dungeon; alt. Multi-User Dimension] 1. A class
of {virtual reality} experiments accessible via the Internet. These are
real-time chat forums with structure; they have multiple `locations' like an
adventure game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a simple
economic system, and the capability for characters to build more structure
onto the database that represents the existing world. 2. vi. To play a MUD.
The acronym MUD is often lowercased and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of
`going mudding', etc. Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with
names of MU- form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on
the University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game
still exist today and are sometimes generically called BartleMUDs. There is a
widespread myth (repeated, unfortunately, by earlier versions of this
lexicon) that the name MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by
Bartle on British Telecom (the motto: "You haven't _lived_ 'til you've _died_
on MUD!"); however, this is false -- Richard Bartle explicitly placed `MUD'
in the public domain in 1985. BT was upset at this, as they had already
printed trademark claims on some maps and posters, which were released and
created the myth. Students on the European academic networks quickly improved
on the
