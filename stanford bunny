 :Stanford Bunny: The successor of the {Utah Teapot}. The model is of a
chocolate Easter bunny consisting of about 5000 polygons. It is small by 2002
standards, but is more illustrative than the teapot of of techniques such as
surface radiance (e.g. radiosity) and self-reflection. There is a history
page. Compare {lenna}.
