 :grilf: //, n. Girlfriend. Like {newsfroup} and {filk}, a typo reincarnated
as a new word. seems to have originated sometime in 1990 on {Usenet}. [A
friend tells me there was a Lloyd Biggle SF novel Watchers Of The Dark, in
which alien species after species goes insane and begins to chant "Grilf!
Grilf!". A human detective eventually determines that the word means "Liar!"
I hope this has nothing to do with the popularity of the Usenet term. --ESR]
