 MOBY (moh'bee) n. This term entered the world of AI with the Fabritek 256K
moby memory of MIT-AI. Thus, classically, 256K words, the size of a PDP-10
moby. (The maximum address space means the maximum normally addressable
space, as opposed to the amount of physical memory a machine can have. Thus
the MIT PDP-10s each have two mobies, usually referred to as the "low moby"
(0-777777) and "high moby" (1000000-1777777), or as "moby 0" and "moby 1".
MIT-AI had four mobies of address space: moby 2 was the PDP-6 memory, and
moby 3 the PDP-11 interface.) In this sense "moby" is often used as a generic
unit of either address space (18. bits' worth) or of memory (about a
megabyte, or 9/8 megabyte (if one accounts for difference between 32.- and
36.-bit words), or 5/4 megacharacters).
