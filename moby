 MOBY [seems to have been in use among model railroad fans years ago. Entered
the world of AI with the Fabritek 256K moby memory of MIT-AI. Derived from
Melville's "Moby Dick" (some say from "Moby Pickle").] 1. adj. Large,
immense, or complex. "A moby frob." 2. n. The maximum address space of a
machine, hence 3. n. 256K words, the size of a PDP-10 moby. (The maximum
address space means the maximum normally addressable space, as opposed to the
amount of physical memory a machine can have. Thus the MIT PDP-10s each have
two mobies, usually referred to as the "low moby" (0-777777) and "high moby"
(1000000-1777777), or as "moby 0" and "moby 1". MIT-AI has four mobies of
address space: moby 2 is the PDP-6 memory, and moby 3 the PDP-11 interface.)
In this sense "moby" is often used as a generic unit of either address space
(18. bits' worth) or of memory (about a megabyte, or 9/8 megabyte (if one
accounts for difference between 32.- and 36.-bit words), or 5/4
megacharacters). 4. A title of address (never of third-person reference),
usually used to show admiration, respect, and/or friendliness to a competent
hacker. "So, moby Knight, how's the CONS machine doing?" 5. adj. In
backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in "moby sixes", "moby ones", etc. MOBY
FOO, MOBY WIN, MOBY LOSS: standard emphatic forms. FOBY MOO: a spoonerism due
to Greenblatt.
