 MOBY /moh'bee/ n., sense 2. This term entered the world of AI with the
Fabritek 256K moby memory of MIT-AI. Thus, classically, 256K words, the size
of a PDP-10 moby. Back when address registers were narrow, the term was more
generally useful; because when a computer had "virtual memory mapping" it
might actually have more physical memory attached to it than any one program
could access directly. One could then say "This computer has six mobies" to
mean that the ratio of physical memory to address space is six, without
having to say specifically how much memory there actually is. That in turn
implies that the computer can timeshare six "full-sized" programs without
having to swap programs between memory and disk. Thus the MIT PDP-10s each
had two mobies, usually referred to as the "low moby" (0-777777) and "high
moby" (1000000-1777777), or as "moby 0" and "moby 1". MIT-AI had four mobies
of address space: moby 2 was the PDP-6 memory, and moby 3 the PDP-11
interface.) Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means registers are
typically wider than the most memory you can cram onto a machine, so most
systems have much *less* than 1 theoretical `native' moby of core. However,
the size of the PDP-10 "moby" was often used as a generic unit of either
address space (18. bits' worth) or of memory (about a megabyte, or 9/8
megabyte (if one accounts for difference between 32- and 36-bit words), or
5/4 megacharacters).
