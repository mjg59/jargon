 POPJ: /pop'jay/ [from a {PDP-10} return-from-subroutine instruction] n.v. To
return from a digression. By verb doubling, "Popj, popj" means roughly, "Now
let's see, where were we?" see {RTI}. posing: n. On a {MUD}, the use of `:'
or an equivalent command to announce to other players that one is taking a
certain physical action, which however has no effect on the game. For
example, if one's character name is Firechild, one might type `: begins
hacking on the nearest terminal' to broadcast a message that says `Firechild
begins hacking on the nearest terminal'. post: v. To send a message to a
{mailing list} or {newsgroup}. Distinguished in context from `mail'; one
might ask, for example, "Are you going to post the patch or mail it to known
users?" posting: n. Noun corresp. to v. {post} (but note that the {post} can
be nouned). Distinguished from a `letter' or ordinary {email} message by the
fact that it's broadcast rather than point-to-point. It is unclear whether
messages sent to a small mailing list are postings or email; perhaps the best
dividing line is that if you don't know the names of all the potential
recipients, it's a posting. postmaster: n. The email contact and maintenance
person at a site connected to the Internet or UUCPNET. Often, but not always,
the same as the {admin}. It is conventional for each machine to have a
`postmaster' address that is aliased to this person. pound on: vt. Syn. {bang
on}. power cycle: vt. (also, `cycle power' or just `cycle') To power off a
machine and then power it on immediately, with the intention of clearing some
kind of {hung} or {gronk}ed state. Syn. {120 reset}; see also {Big Red
Switch}. Compare {vulcan nerve pinch}, {bounce}, {boot}, and see the AI Koan
in Appendix A about Tom Knight and the novice.
