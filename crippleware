 :crippleware: /n./ 1. Software that has some important functionality
deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users to pay for a working
version. 2. [Cambridge] Variety of {guiltware} that exhorts you to donate to
some charity (compare {careware}, {nagware}). 3. Hardware deliberately
crippled, which can be upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change
(e.g., cutting a jumper). An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is
Intel's 486SX chip, which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor
dyked out (in some early versions it was present but disabled). To upgrade,
you buy a complete 486DX chip with *working* co-processor (its identity
thinly veiled by a different pinout) and plug it into the board's expansion
socket. It then disables the SX, which becomes a fancy power sink. Don't you
love Intel?
