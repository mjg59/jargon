 :crippleware: n. 1. Software that has some important functionality
deliberately removed, so as to entice potential users to pay for a working
version. 2. [Cambridge] {Guiltware} that exhorts you to donate to some
charity (compare {careware}). 3. Hardware deliberately crippled, which can be
upgraded to a more expensive model by a trivial change (e.g., cutting a
jumper). An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX chip,
which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor disabled. To upgrade,
you buy another 486 chip with everything *but* the co-processor disabled.
When you put them together you have two crippled chips doing the work of one.
Don't you love Intel?
