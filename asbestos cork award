 :asbestos cork award: n. Once, long ago at MIT, there was a {flamer} so
consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed, had made, and
distributed posters announcing that said flamer had been nominated for the
`asbestos cork award'. Persons in any doubt as to the intended application of
the cork should consult the etymology under {flame}. Since then, it is agreed
that only a select few have risen to the heights of bombast required to earn
this dubious dignity --- but there is no agreement on *which* few.
