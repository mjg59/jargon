 :Hanlon's Razor: prov. A corollary of {Finagle's Law}, similar to Occam's
Razor, that reads "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity." The derivation of the common title Hanlon's Razor is
unknown; a similar epigram has been attributed to William James. Quoted here
because it seems to be a particular favorite of hackers, often showing up in
{fortune cookie} files and the login banners of BBS systems and commercial
networks. This probably reflects the hacker's daily experience of
environments created by well-intentioned but short-sighted people. Compare
{Sturgeon's Law}.
