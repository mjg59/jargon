 HANLON'S RAZOR (han'lnz ray'zr) n. A "murphyism" parallel to Occam's Razor
that reads "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained
by stupidity". Quoted here because it seems to be a particular favorite of
hackers, often showing up in FORTUNE COOKIE files and the login banners of
BBS systems and commercial networks. This probably reflects the hacker's
daily experience of environments created by the well-intentioned but
shortsighted.
