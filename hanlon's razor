 :Hanlon's Razor: prov. A corollary of {Finagle's Law}, similar to Occam's
Razor, that reads "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity." The derivation of the Hanlon eponym is not
definitely known, but a very similar remark ("You have attributed conditions
to villainy that simply result from stupidity.") appears in "Logic of
Empire", a classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who calls it the
`devil theory' of sociology. Heinlein's popularity in the hacker culture
makes plausible the supposition that `Hanlon' is derived from `Heinlein' by
phonetic corruption. A similar epigram has been attributed to William James,
but Heinlein more probably got the idea from Alfred Korzybski and other
practitioners of General Semantics. Quoted here because it seems to be a
particular favorite of hackers, often showing up in {sig block}s, {fortune
cookie} files and the login banners of BBS systems and commercial networks.
This probably reflects the hacker's daily experience of environments created
by well-intentioned but short-sighted people. Compare {Sturgeon's Law},
{Ninety-Ninety Rule}.
