 :Hanlon's Razor: prov. A corollary of {Finagle's Law}, similar to Occam's
Razor, that reads "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity." Quoted here because it seems to be a particular
favorite of hackers, often showing up in {sig block}s, {fortune cookie} files
and the login banners of BBS systems and commercial networks. This probably
reflects the hacker's daily experience of environments created by
well-intentioned but short-sighted people. Compare {Sturgeon's Law},
{Ninety-Ninety Rule}. At http://www.statusq.org/2001/11/26.html it is claimed
that Hanlon's Razor was coined by one Robert J. Hanlon of Scranton, PA.
However, a curiously similar remark ("You have attributed conditions to
villainy that simply result from stupidity.") appears in Logic of Empire, a
classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who calls the error it indicates
the `devil theory' of sociology. Similar epigrams have been attributed to
William James and (on dubious evidence) Napoleon Bonaparte.
