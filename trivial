 :trivial: adj. 1. Too simple to bother detailing. 2. Not worth the speaker's
time. 3. Complex, but solvable by methods so well known that anyone not
utterly {cretinous} would have thought of them already. 4. Any problem one
has already solved (some claim that hackish `trivial' usually evaluates to
`I've seen it before'). Hackers' notions of triviality may be quite at
variance with those of non-hackers. see {nontrivial}, {uninteresting}.
