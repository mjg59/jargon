 :trivial: adj. 1. Too simple to bother detailing. 2. Not worth the speaker's
time. 3. Complex, but solvable by methods so well known that anyone not
utterly {cretinous} would have thought of them already. 4. Any problem one
has already solved (some claim that hackish trivial usually evaluates to
"I've seen it before"). Hackers' notions of triviality may be quite at
variance with those of non-hackers. see {nontrivial}, {uninteresting}. The
physicist Richard Feynman, who had the hacker nature to an amazing degree
(see his essay "Los Alamos From Below" in Surely You're Joking, Mr.
Feynman!), defined trivial theorem as "one that has already been proved".
