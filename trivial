 TRIVIAL (tri'vi-@l) adj. 1. In explanation, too simple to bother detailing.
2. Not worth the speaker's time. 3. Complex, but solvable by methods so
well-known that anyone not utterly CRETINOUS would have thought of them
already. Hackers' notions of triviality may be quite at variance with those
of non-hackers. see NONTRIVIAL, UNINTERESTING.
