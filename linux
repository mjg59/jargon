 :Linux:: n. The free Unix workalike created by Linus Torvalds and friends
starting about 1990. This may be the most remarkable hacker project in
history -- an entire clone of Unix for 386 and 486 micros, distributed for
free with sources over the net. This is what {GNU} aimed to be, but the Free
Software Foundation has not (as of early 1995) produced the kernel to go with
its Unix toolset (which Linux uses). Other, similar efforts like FreeBSD and
NetBSD have been much less successful. The secret of Linux's success may be
that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the development process open
and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball effect.
