 :Linux:: /lee'nuhks/ or /li'nuks/, *not* /li:'nuhks/ /n./ The free Unix
workalike created by Linus Torvalds and friends starting about 1990 (the
pronunciation /lee'nuhks/ is preferred because the name `Linus' has an /ee/
sound in Swedish). This may be the most remarkable hacker project in history
-- an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and Pentium micros, distributed for
free with sources over the net (ports to Alpha and Sparc-based machines are
underway). This is what {GNU} aimed to be, but the Free Software Foundation
has not (as of early 1996) produced the kernel to go with its Unix toolset
(which Linux uses). Other, similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been
much less successful. The secret of Linux's success seems to be that Linus
worked much harder early on to keep the development process open and recruit
other hackers, creating a snowball effect.
