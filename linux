 :Linux:: n. /li'nuks/, *not* /lee'nuks/ The free Unix workalike created by
Linus Torvalds and friends starting about 1990 (it's pronounced /li'nux/
because the name `Linus' has a short i in Swedish). This may be the most
remarkable hacker project in history -- an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486
and Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to
Alpha and Sparc-based machines are underway). This is what {GNU} aimed to be,
but the Free Software Foundation has not (as of early 1996) produced the
kernel to go with its Unix toolset (which Linux uses). Other, similar efforts
like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been much less successful. The secret of Linux's
success may be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the development
process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball effect.
