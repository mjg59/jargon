 :infinity: n. 1. The largest value that can be represented in a particular
type of variable (register, memory location, data type, whatever). 2. minus
infinity: The smallest such value, not necessarily or even usually the simple
negation of plus infinity. In N-bit twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is
2^N-1 - 1 but minus infinity is - (2^N-1), not -(2^N-1 - 1). Note also that
this is different from time T equals minus infinity, which is closer to a
mathematician's usage of infinity.
