 :videotex: /n.,obs./ An electronic service offering people the privilege of
paying to read the weather on their television screens instead of having
somebody read it to them for free while they brush their teeth. The idea
bombed everywhere it wasn't government-subsidized, because by the time
videotex was practical the installed base of personal computers could hook up
to timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might have been
worthwhile better and cheaper. Videotex planners badly overestimated both the
appeal of getting information from a computer and the cost of local
intelligence at the user's end. Like the {gorilla arm} effect, this has been
a cautionary tale to hackers ever since. see also {vannevar}.
