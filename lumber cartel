 :Lumber Cartel: n. A mythical conspiracy accused by {spam}-spewers of
funding anti-spam activism in order to force the direct-mail promotions
industry back onto paper. Hackers, predictably, responded by forming a
"Lumber Cartel" spoofing this paranoid theory; the web page is
http://come.to/the.lumber.cartel/. Members often include the tag TINLC
("There Is No Lumber Cartel") in their postings; see {TINC}, {backbone cabal}
and {NANA} for explanation.
