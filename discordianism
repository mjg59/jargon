 DISCORDIANISM (dis-kor'di-uhn-ism) n. The veneration of ERIS, aka Discordia;
widely popular among hackers. Popularized by Robert Anton Wilson's
_Illuminatus!_ trilogy as a sort of self-subverting dada-Zen for Westerners
-- it should on no account be taken seriously but is far more serious than
most jokes. Usually connected with an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke
involving millenia-long warfare between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of
Eris and a malevolent, authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati.
