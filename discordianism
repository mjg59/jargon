 DISCORDIANISM (dis-kor'di-uhn-ism) n. The veneration of ERIS, aka Discordia.
Popularized by Robert Anton Wilson's _Illuminatus!_ trilogy as a sort of
self-subverting dada-Zen for Westerners -- it should on no account be taken
seriously but is far more serious than most jokes. Usually connected with an
elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millenia-long warfare between the
partisans of Eris and a malevolent secret society called the Illuminati. see
