 :Discordianism: /dis·kor´di·@n·ism/, n. The veneration of {Eris}, a.k.a.
Discordia; widely popular among hackers. Discordianism was popularized by
Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's novel Illuminatus! as a sort of
self-subverting Dada-Zen for Westerners -- it should on no account be taken
seriously but is far more serious than most jokes. Consider, for example, the
Fifth Commandment of the Pentabarf, from Principia Discordia: "A Discordian
is Prohibited of Believing What he Reads." Discordianism is usually connected
with an elaborate conspiracy theory/joke involving millennia-long warfare
between the anarcho-surrealist partisans of Eris and a malevolent,
authoritarian secret society called the Illuminati. see Religion in Appendix
B, {Church of the SubGenius}, and {ha ha only serious}.
