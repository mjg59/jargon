 MFTL: /em-eff-tee-ell/ [acronym: My Favorite Toy Language] 1. adj. Describes
a talk on a programming language design which is heavy on syntax, frequently
BNF, sometimes even talks about semantics, e.g., type systems, but rarely, if
ever, has any content (see {content-free}). More broadly applied to talks
even when the topic is not a programming language, but the subject matter is
gone into in unnecessary and meticulous detail at the sacrifice of any
conceptual content. Usage: "Well, it was a typical MFTL talk". 2. n.
Describes a language developed by an individual or group, which they are
passionate about, but which hardly anyone outside the group cares about.
Applied to the language by those outside the group. "He cornered me about
type resolution in his MFTL" mickey: n. The resolution unit of mouse
movement. It has been suggested that the `disney' will become a benchmark
unit for animation graphics performance. micro-: pref. 1. Very small; this is
the root of its use as a quantifier prefix. 2. As that decimal prefix,
calling for multiplication by `10 ^ -6' (see {{quantifiers}}). Neither of
these uses is peculiar to hackers, but hackers tend to fling them both around
rather more freely than is countenanced in standard English. It is recorded,
for example, that one CS professor used to characterize the standard length
of his lectures as a microcentury --- that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
{attoparsec}, {nanoacre}, and especially {microfortnight}). 3. Personal or
human-scale --- that is, capable of being maintained or comprehended or
manipulated by one human being. This sense is generalized from
`microcomputer', and esp. used in contrast with `macro-' (the corresponding
Greek prefix meaning `large'). 4. Local as opposed to global (or {macro-}).
Thus a hacker might say, for example, that buying a smaller car to reduce
pollution only solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of getting to work
might be better solved by using mass transit, moving to within walking
distance, or (best of all) telecommuting. microfortnight: n. About 1.2 sec.
The VMS operating system has a lot of tuning parameters that you can set with
the SYSGEN utility, and one of these is TIMEPROMPTWAIT, the time the system
will wait for an operator to set the correct date and time at boot if it
realizes that the current value is bogus. This time is specified in
microfortnights! Multiple uses of the millifortnight (about 20 minutes) and
{nanofortnight} have also been reported. microfloppies: n. 3.5-inch floppies,
as opposed to 5.25-inch {vanilla} or mini-floppies and the now-obsolete
8-inch variety. This term may be headed for obsolescence as 5.25-inchers pass
out of use, only to be revived if anybody floats a sub-3-inch floppy
standard. see {stiffy}, {minifloppies}. microLenat: n. see {bogosity}.
microReid: n. see {bogosity}. microtape: n. Occasionally used to mean a
DECtape, as opposed to a {macrotape}. A DECtape is a small reel of magnetic
tape about four inches in diameter and an inch across. Unlike normal drivers
for standard magnetic tapes, microtape drivers allow random access to the
data. In their heyday they were used in pretty much the same ways one would
now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save and transport files
and programs. Apparently the term `microtape' was actually the official term
used within DEC for these tapes until someone coined the word `DECtape',
which, of course, sounded sexier to the {marketroid} types. middle-endian:
adj. Not {big-endian} or {little-endian}. Used of byte orders like 3-4-1-2 or
2-1-4-3 occasionally found in the packed-decimal formats of minicomputer
manufacturers who shall remain nameless. see {NUXI problem}. milliLampson:
/mil'i-lamp`sn/ n. A unit of talking speed abbreviated mL. Most people run
about 200 milliLampsons. Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems
implementor highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000. A few people speak
faster. This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes widely
disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and actually emit them in
speech. For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell (designer of the
PDP-11) is said (with some awe) to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at
about 300; he is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth
tries to keep up with his speeding brain. minifloppies: n. 5.25-inch
{vanilla} floppy disks, as opposed to 3.5-inch or {microfloppies} and the
now-obsolescent 8-inch variety. At one time, this term was a trademark of
Shugart Associates for their SA-400 minifloppy drive. Nobody paid any
attention. see {stiffy}.
