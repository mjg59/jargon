 :line noise: n. 1. [techspeak] Spurious characters due to electrical noise
in a communications link, especially an RS-232 serial connection. Line noise
may be induced by poor connections, interference or crosstalk from other
circuits, electrical storms, {cosmic rays}, or (notionally) birds crapping on
the phone wires. 2. Any chunk of data in a file or elsewhere that looks like
the results of line noise in sense 1. 3. Text that is theoretically a
readable text or program source but employs syntax so bizarre that it looks
like line noise in senses 1 or 2. Yes, there are languages this ugly. The
canonical example is {TECO}; it is often claimed that "TECO's input syntax is
indistinguishable from line noise." Other non-{WYSIWYG} editors, such as
Multics `qed' and Unix `ed', in the hands of a real hacker, also qualify
easily, as do deliberately obfuscated languages such as {INTERCAL}.
