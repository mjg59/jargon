 :slashdot effect: n. 1. Also spelled "/. effect"; what is said to have
happened when a website being virtually unreachable because too many people
are hitting it after the site was mentioned in an interesting article on the
popular Slashdot (http://slashdot.org/) news service. The term is quite
widely used by /. readers, including variants like "That site has been
slashdotted again!" 2. In a perhaps inevitable generation, the term is being
used to describe any similar effect from being listed on a popular site. This
would better be described as a {flash crowd}.
