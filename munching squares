 MUNCHING SQUARES n. A DISPLAY HACK dating back to the PDP-1, which employs a
trivial computation (involving XOR'ing of x-y display coordinates --- see
HAKMEM items 146-148) to produce an impressive display of moving, growing,
and shrinking squares. The hack usually has a parameter (usually taken from
toggle switches) which when well-chosen can produce amazing effects. Some of
these, (re)discovered recently on the LISP machine, have been christened
MUNCHING TRIANGLES, MUNCHING W'S, and MUNCHING MAZES. More generally, suppose
a graphics program produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some
basic form FOO on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively simple
program; then the program (or the resulting display) is likely to be referred
to as "munching FOOs" (this is a good example of the use of the word FOO as a
metasyntactic variable).
