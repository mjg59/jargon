 MUNCHING SQUARES n. A display hack dating back to the PDP-1, which employs a
trivial computation (involving XOR'ing of x-y display coordinates - see
HAKMEM items 146-148) to produce an impressive display of moving, growing,
and shrinking squares. The hack usually has a parameter (usually taken from
toggle switches) which when well-chosen can produce amazing effects. Some of
these, discovered recently on the LISP machine, have been christened MUNCHING
TRIANGLES, MUNCHING W'S, and MUNCHING MAZES.
