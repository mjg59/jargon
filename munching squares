 :munching squares: /n./ A {display hack} dating back to the PDP-1 (ca. 1962,
reportedly discovered by Jackson Wright), which employs a trivial computation
(repeatedly plotting the graph Y = X XOR T for successive values of T -- see
{HAKMEM} items 146--148) to produce an impressive display of moving and
growing squares that devour the screen. The initial value of T is treated as
a parameter, which, when well-chosen, can produce amazing effects. Some of
these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine, have been christened
`munching triangles' (try AND for XOR and toggling points instead of plotting
them), `munching w's', and `munching mazes'. More generally, suppose a
graphics program produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some
basic form, foo, on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively simple
program; then the program (or the resulting display) is likely to be referred
to as `munching foos'. [This is a good example of the use of the word {foo}
as a {metasyntactic variable}.]
