 :grok: /grok/, var. /grohk/ vt. [common; from the novel "Stranger in a
Strange Land", by Robert A. Heinlein, where it is a Martian word meaning
literally `to drink' and metaphorically `to be one with'] The emphatic form
is `grok in fullness'. 1. To understand. Connotes intimate and exhaustive
knowledge. When you claim to `grok' some knowledge or technique, you are
asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way
but that it has become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to
say that you "know" {LISP} is simply to assert that you can code in it if
necessary - but to say you "grok" LISP is to claim that you have deeply
entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that
it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast {zen}, which is similar
supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. see also {glark}.
2. Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. "Almost all
C compilers grok the `void' type these days."
