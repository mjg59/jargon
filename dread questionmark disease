 :Dread Questionmark Disease: n. The result of saving HTML from Microsoft
Word or some other program that uses the nonstandard Microsoft variant of
Latin-1; the symptom is that various of those nonstandard characters in
positions 128-160 show up as questionmarks. The usual culprit is the misnamed
`smart quotes' feature in Microsoft Word. For more details (and a program
called `demoroniser' that cleans up the mess) see
