 UNINTERESTING adj. 1. Said of a problem which, while NONTRIVIAL, can be
solved simply by throwing sufficient resources at it. 2. Also said of
problems for which a solution would neither advance the state of the art nor
be fun to design and code. True hackers regard uninteresting problems as an
intolerable waste of time, to be solved (if at all) by lesser mortals. see
WOMBAT, SMOP; oppose INTERESTING. U*IX, UN*X n. Used to refer to the Unix
operating system (trademark and/or copyright AT&T) in writing, but avoiding
the need for the ugly (tm) typography. Also used to refer to any or all
varieties of Unixoid operating systems. Ironically, lawyers now say (1990)
that the requirement for superscript-tm has no legal force, but the asterisk
usage is entrenched anyhow. It has been suggested that there may be a
psychological connection to practice in certain religions where the name of
the deity is never written out in full, e.g. JHWH or G-d is used.
