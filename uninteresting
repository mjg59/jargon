 :uninteresting: adj. 1. Said of a problem that, although {nontrivial}, can
be solved simply by throwing sufficient resources at it. 2. Also said of
problems for which a solution would neither advance the state of the art nor
be fun to design and code. Hackers regard uninteresting problems as
intolerable wastes of time, to be solved (if at all) by lesser mortals.
*Real* hackers (see {toolsmith}) generalize uninteresting problems enough to
make them interesting and solve them -- thus solving the original problem as
a special case (and, it must be admitted, occasionally turning a molehill
into a mountain, or a mountain into a tectonic plate). see {WOMBAT}, {SMOP};
compare {toy problem}, oppose {interesting}.
