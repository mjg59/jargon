 UNINTERESTING (un-in'ter-est-ing) adj. 1. Said of a problem which, while
NONTRIVIAL, can be solved simply by throwing sufficient resources at it. 2.
Also said of problems for which a solution would neither advance the state of
the art nor be fun to design and code. True hackers regard uninteresting
problems as an intolerable waste of time, to be solved (if at all) by lesser
mortals. see WOMBAT. U*IX, UN*X n. Used to refer to the Unix operating system
(trademark and/or copyright AT&T) in writing, but avoiding the need for the
ugly (tm) typography. Also used to refer to any or all varieties of Unixoid
operating systems. Ironically, some lawyers now claim (1990) that the
requirement for superscript-tm has no legal force, but yje asterisk usage is
entrenched anyhow.
