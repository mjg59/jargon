 :Great Internet Explosion: The mainstreaming of the Internet in 1993-1994.
Used normally in time comparatives; before the Great Internet Explosion and
after it were very different worlds from a hacker's point of view. Before it,
Internet access was expensive and available only to an elite few through
universities, research laboratories, and well-heeled corporations; after it,
everybody's mother had access.
