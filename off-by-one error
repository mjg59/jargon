 :off-by-one error: n. [common] Exceedingly common error induced in many
ways, such as by starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or
vice-versa, or by writing `< N' instead of `<= N' or vice-versa. Also applied
to giving something to the person next to the one who should have gotten it.
Often confounded with {fencepost error}, which is properly a particular
subtype of it.
