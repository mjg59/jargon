 OFF-BY-ONE ERROR n. Exceedingly common error induced in many ways, usually
by starting at 0 when you should have started at 1 or vice versa. Also
applied to giving an object to the person next to the one who should have
gotten it. Often confused with FENCEPOST ERROR, which is properly a
particular subtype of it.
