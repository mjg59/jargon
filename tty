 :tty: /T-T-Y/, /tit'ee/ n. The latter pronunciation was primarily ITS, but
some Unix people say it this way as well; this pronunciation is _not_
considered to have sexual undertones. 1. A terminal of the teletype variety,
characterized by a noisy mechanical printer, a very limited character set,
and poor print quality. Usage: antiquated (like the TTYs themselves). see
also {bit-paired keyboard}. 2. [especially Unix] Any terminal at all;
sometimes used to refer to the particular terminal controlling a given job.
3. [Unix] Any serial port, whether or not the device connected to it is a
terminal; so called because under Unix such devices have names of the form
tty*. Ambiguity between senses 2 and 3 is common but seldom bothersome.
