 :dickless workstation: /n./ Extremely pejorative hackerism for `diskless
workstation', a class of botches including the Sun 3/50 and other machines
designed exclusively to network with an expensive central disk server. These
combine all the disadvantages of time-sharing with all the disadvantages of
distributed personal computers; typically, they cannot even {boot} themselves
without help (in the form of some kind of {breath-of-life packet}) from the
server.
