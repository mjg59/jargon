 DICKLESS WORKSTATION (dik'less werk'sta-shn) n. Extremely pejorative
hackerism for "diskless workstation", a class of botches including the Sun
3/50 and other machines designed exclusively to network with an expensive
central disk server. These combine all the disadvantages of time-sharing with
all the disadvantages of distributed personal computers.
