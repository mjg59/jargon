 :functino: n. [uncommon, U.K.; originally a serendipitous typo in 1994] A
pointer to a function in C and C++. By association with sub-atomic particles
such as the neutrino, it accurately conveys an impression of smallness (one
pointer is four bytes on most systems) and speed (hackers can and do use
arrays of functinos to replace a switch() statement).
