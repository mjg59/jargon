 :JCL: /J-C-L/ n. 1. IBM's supremely {rude} Job Control Language. JCL is the
script language used to control the execution of programs in IBM's batch
systems. JCL has a very {fascist} syntax, and some versions will, for
example, {barf} if two spaces appear where it expects one. Most programmers
confronted with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the
file names. Someone who actually understands and generates unique JCL is
regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who memorizes the phone
book. It is reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing "Who's the
breeder of the crud that mangles you and me? I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e" to the
tune of the "Mickey Mouse Club" theme to express their opinion of the beast.
2. A comparative for any very {rude} software that a hacker is expected to
use. "That's as bad as JCL." As with {COBOL}, JCL is often used as an
archetype of ugliness even by those who haven't experienced it. see also
{IBM}, {fear and loathing}. A (poorly documented, naturally) shell simulating
JCL syntax is available at the Retrocomputing Museum
