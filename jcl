 2. A mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a bizarre,
fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see {troglodyte}, sense
2). ITS worshipers manage somehow to continue believing that an OS maintained
by assembly-language hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character
filenames in one directory per account remains superior to today's state of
commercial art (their venom against {Unix} is particularly intense). see also
{holy wars}, {Weenix}. :IWBNI: // Abbreviation for `It Would Be Nice If'.
Compare {WIBNI}. :IYFEG: // [Usenet] Abbreviation for `Insert Your Favorite
Ethnic Group'. Used as a meta-name when telling ethnic jokes on the net to
avoid offending anyone. see {JEDR}. = J = ===== :J. Random: /J rand'm/ n.
[common; generalized from {J. Random Hacker}] Arbitrary; ordinary; any one;
any old. `J. Random' is often prefixed to a noun to make a name out of it. It
means roughly `some particular' or `any specific one'. "Would you let J.
Random Loser marry your daughter?" The most common uses are `J. Random
Hacker', `J. Random Loser', and `J. Random Nerd' ("Should J. Random Loser be
allowed to {gun} down other people?"), but it can be used simply as an
elaborate version of {random} in any sense. :J. Random Hacker: /J rand'm
hak'r/ n. [very common] A mythical figure like the Unknown Soldier; the
archetypal hacker nerd. This term is one of the oldest in the jargon,
apparently going back to MIT in the 1960s. see {random}, {Suzie COBOL}. This
may originally have been inspired by `J. Fred Muggs', a show-biz chimpanzee
whose name was a household word back in the early days of {TMRC}, and was
probably influenced by `J. Presper Eckert' (one of the co-inventors of the
electronic computer). see also {Fred Foobar}. :jack in: v. To log on to a
machine or connect to a network or {BBS}, esp. for purposes of entering a
{virtual reality} simulation such as a {MUD} or {IRC} (leaving is "jacking
out"). This term derives from {cyberpunk} SF, in which it was used for the
act of plugging an electrode set into neural sockets in order to interface
the brain directly to a virtual reality. It is primarily used by MUD and IRC
fans and younger hackers on BBS systems. :jaggies: /jag'eez/ n. The
`stairstep' effect observable when an edge (esp. a linear edge of very
shallow or steep slope) is rendered on a pixel device (as opposed to a vector
display). :Java: An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by
James Gosling (and known by the name "Oak") with the intention of being the
successor to {C++} (the project was however originally sold to Sun as an
embedded language for use in set-top boxes). After the great Internet
explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a byte-interpreted language and
became the focus of a relentless hype campaign by Sun, which touted it as the
new language of choice for distributed applications. Java is indeed a
stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been embraced by many in the
hacker community - but it has been a considerable source of frustration to
many others, for reasons ranging from uneven support on different Web browser
platforms, performance issues, and some notorious deficiencies of some of the
standard toolkits (AWT in particular). {Microsoft}'s determined attempts to
corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly)
have not helped. As of 1999, these issues are still in the process of being
resolved. Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult
to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a complex,
real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet, and no other
language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the limelight the
way Java has). On the other hand, Java has already been a big {win} in
academic circles, where it has taken the place of {Pascal} as the preferred
tool for teaching the basics of good programming to the next generation of
hackers. :JCL: /J-C-L/ n. 1. IBM's supremely {rude} Job Control Language. JCL
is the script language used to control the execution of programs in
