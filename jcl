 J. Random: /J rand'm/ n. [generalized from {J. Random Hacker}] Arbitrary;
ordinary; any one; any old. `J. Random' is often prefixed to a noun to make a
name out of it. It means roughly `some particular' or `any specific one'.
"Would you let J. Random Loser marry your daughter?" The most common uses are
`J. Random Hacker', `J. Random Loser', and `J. Random Nerd' ("Should J.
Random Loser be allowed to {gun} down other people?"), but it can be used
simply as an elaborate version of {random} in any sense. J. Random Hacker:
[MIT] /J rand'm hak'r/ n. A mythical figure like the Unknown Soldier; the
archetypal hacker nerd. see {random}, {Suzie COBOL}. This may originally have
been inspired or influenced by `J. Fred Muggs', a show-biz chimpanzee whose
name was a household word back in the early days of {TMRC}. jaggies:
/jag'eez/ n. The `stairstep' effect observable when an edge (esp. a linear
edge of very shallow or steep slope) is rendered on a pixel device (as
opposed to a vector display). JCL: /J-C-L/ n. 1. IBM's supremely {rude} Job
Control Language. JCL is the script language used to control the execution of
programs in IBM's batch systems. JCL has a very {fascist} syntax, and some
versions will, for example, {barf} if two spaces appear where it expects one.
Most programmers confronted with JCL simply copy a working file (or card
deck), changing the file names. Someone who actually understands and
generates unique JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone
who memorizes the phone book. It is reported that hackers at IBM itself
sometimes sing "Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles you and me? I-B-M,
J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e" to the tune of the "Mickey Mouse Club" theme to express
their opinion of the beast. 2. A comparative for any very {rude} software
that a hacker is expected to use. "That's as bad as JCL." As with {COBOL},
JCL is often used as an archetype of ugliness even by those who haven't
experienced it. see also {IBM}, {fear and loathing}.
