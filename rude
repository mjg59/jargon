 :rude: [WPI] adj. 1. (of a program) Badly written. 2. Functionally poor,
e.g., a program that is very difficult to use because of gratuitously poor
(random?) design decisions. Oppose {cuspy}. 3. Anything that manipulates a
shared resource without regard for its other users in such a way as to cause
a (non-fatal) problem. Examples: programs that change tty modes without
resetting them on exit, or windowing programs that keep forcing themselves to
the top of the window stack. Compare {all-elbows}.
