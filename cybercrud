 :cybercrud: /si:'ber-kruhd/ n. 1. [coined by Ted Nelson] Obfuscatory
tech-talk. Verbiage with a high {MEGO} factor. The computer equivalent of
bureaucratese. 2. Incomprehensible stuff embedded in email. First there were
the "Received" headers that show how mail flows through systems, then MIME
(Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions) headers and part boundaries, and now
huge blocks of radix-64 for PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) or PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) digital signatures and certificates of authenticity. This stuff all
services a purpose and good user interfaces should hide it, but all too often
users are forced to wade through it.
