 :hello, world: interj. 1. The canonical minimal test message in the C/UNIX
universe. 2. Any of the minimal programs that emit this message.
Traditionally, the first program a C coder is supposed to write in a new
environment is one that just prints "hello, world" to standard output (and
indeed it is the first example program in {K&R}). Environments that generate
an unreasonably large executable for this trivial test or which require a
{hairy} compiler-linker invocation to generate it are considered to {lose}
(see {X}). 3. Greeting uttered by a hacker making an entrance or requesting
information from anyone present. "Hello, world! Is the {VAX} back up yet?"
