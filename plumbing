 :plumbing: n. [Unix] Term used for {shell} code, so called because of the
prevalence of `pipelines' that feed the output of one program to the input of
another. Under Unix, user utilities can often be implemented or at least
prototyped by a suitable collection of pipelines and temp-file grinding
encapsulated in a shell script; this is much less effort than writing C every
time, and the capability is considered one of Unix's major winning features.
A few other OSs such as IBM's VM/CMS support similar facilities. Esp. used in
the construction `hairy plumbing' (see {hairy}). "You can kluge together a
basic spell-checker out of `sort(1)', `comm(1)', and `tr(1)' with a little
plumbing." see also {tee}.
