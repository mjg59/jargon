 :initgame: /in-it'gaym/ n. [IRC] An {IRC} version of the venerable trivia
game "20 questions", in which one user changes his {nick} to the initials of
a famous person or other named entity, and the others on the channel ask yes
or no questions, with the one to guess the person getting to be "it" next. As
a courtesy, the one picking the initials starts by providing a 4-letter hint
of the form sex, nationality, life-status, reality-status. For example, MAAR
means "Male, American, Alive, Real" (as opposed to "fictional"). Initgame can
be surprisingly addictive. see also {hing}.
