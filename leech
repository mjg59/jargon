 :leech: 1. n. (Also `leecher'.) Among BBS types, crackers and {warez d00dz},
one who consumes knowledge without generating new software, cracks, or
techniques. BBS culture specifically defines a leech as someone who downloads
files with few or no uploads in return, and who does not contribute to the
message section. Cracker culture extends this definition to someone (a
{lamer}, usually) who constantly presses informed sources for information
and/or assistance, but has nothing to contribute. 2. v. [common, Toronto
area] To instantly fetch a file (other than a mail attachment) whether by FTP
or IRC file req or any other method. seems to be a holdover from the early
1990s when Toronto had a very active BBS and warez scene.
