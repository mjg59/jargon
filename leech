 :leech: 1. n. (Also `leecher'.) Among BBS types, crackers and {warez d00dz},
one who consumes knowledge without generating new software, cracks, or
techniques. BBS culture specifically defines a leech as someone who downloads
files with few or no uploads in return, and who does not contribute to the
message section. Cracker culture extends this definition to someone (a
{lamer}, usually) who constantly presses informed sources for information
and/or assistance, but has nothing to contribute. see {troughie}. 2. v.
[common, Toronto area] v. To download a file across any kind of internet
link. "Hop on IRC later so I can leech some MP3s from you." Used to describe
activities ranging from FTP, to IRC DCC-send, to ICQ file requests, to
Napster searches (but never to downloading email with file attachments; the
implication is that the download is the result of a browse or search of some
sort of file server). seems to be a holdover from the early 1990s when
Toronto had a very active BBS and warez scene. Synonymous with {snarf} (sense
2), and contrast {snarf} (sense 4).
