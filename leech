 :leech: n. Among BBS types, crackers and {warez d00dz}, one who consumes
knowledge without generating new software, cracks or techniques. BBS culture
specifically defines a leech as someone who downloads files with few or no

Cracker culture extends this definition to someone (a {lamer}, usually) who
constantly presses informed sources for information and/or assistance, but
has nothing to contribute.
