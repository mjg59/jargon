 :epsilon squared: n. A quantity even smaller than {epsilon}, as small in
comparison to epsilon as epsilon is to something normal; completely
negligible. If you buy a supercomputer for a million dollars, the cost of the
thousand-dollar terminal to go with it is {epsilon}, and the cost of the
ten-dollar cable to connect them is epsilon squared. Compare {lost in the
underflow}, {lost in the noise}.
