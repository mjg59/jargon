 :syntactic sugar: [coined by Peter Landin] n. Features added to a language
or other formalism to make it `sweeter' for humans, features which do not
affect the expressiveness of the formalism (compare {chrome}). Used esp. when
there is an obvious and trivial translation of the `sugar' feature into other
constructs already present in the notation. C's `a[i]' notation is syntactic
sugar for `*(a + i)'. "Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon." ---
Alan Perlis. The variants `syntactic saccharin' and `syntactic syrup' are
also recorded. These denote something even more gratuitous, in that syntactic
sugar serves a purpose (making something more acceptable to humans), but
syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no purpose at all. Compare {candygrammar},
{syntactic salt}.
