 :syntactic sugar: [coined by Peter Landin] n. Features added to a language
or other formalism to make it `sweeter' for humans, which do not affect the
expressiveness of the formalism (compare {chrome}). Used esp. when there is
an obvious and trivial translation of the `sugar' feature into other
constructs already present in the notation. C's `a[i]' notation is syntactic
sugar for `*(a + i)'. "Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon." ---
Alan Perlis. The variants `syntactic saccharin' and `syntactic syrup' are
also recorded. These denotes something even more gratuitous, in that
syntactic sugar serves a purpose (making something more acceptable to
humans), but syntactic saccharin or syrup serves no purpose at all. Compare
{candygrammar}, {syntactic salt}.
