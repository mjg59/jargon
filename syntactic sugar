 SYNTACTIC SUGAR n. Features added to a language or formalism to make it
`sweeter' for humans, that do not affect the expressiveness of the formalism
(compare CHROME). Used esp. when there is an obvious and trivial translation
of the `sugar' feature into other constructs already present in the notation.
Example: the \n, \t, \r, and \b escapes in C strings, which could be
expressed as octal escapes. Coined by Peter Landin. "Syntactic sugar causes
cancer of the semicolon." - Alan Perlis.
