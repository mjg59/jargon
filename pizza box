 :pizza box: [Sun] n. The largish thin box housing the electronics in
(especially Sun) desktop workstations, so named because of its size and shape
and the dimpled pattern that looks like air holes. Two meg single-platter
removable disk packs used to be called pizzas, and the huge drive they were
stuck into was referred to as a pizza oven. It's an index of progress that in
the old days just the disk was pizza-sized, while now the entire computer is.
