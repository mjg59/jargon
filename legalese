 :legalese: n. Dense, pedantic verbiage in a language description, product
specification, or interface standard; text that seems designed to obfuscate
and requires a {language lawyer} to {parse} it. Though hackers are not afraid
of high information density and complexity in language (indeed, they rather
enjoy both), they share a deep and abiding loathing for legalese; they
associate it with deception, {suit}s, and situations in which hackers
generally get the short end of the stick.
