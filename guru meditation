 :guru meditation: n. Amiga equivalent of panic in Unix (sometimes just
called a guru or guru event). When the system crashes, a cryptic message of
the form "GURU MEDITATION #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" may appear, indicating what the
problem was. An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers. Sometimes
a {guru} event must be followed by a {Vulcan nerve pinch}. This term is (no
surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the Amiga. An earlier product
of the Amiga corporation was a device called a `Joyboard' which was basically
a plastic board built onto a joystick-like device; it was sold with a skiing
game cartridge for the Atari game machine. It is said that whenever the
prototype OS crashed, the system programmer responsible would calm down by
concentrating on a solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying
to keep the board in balance. This position resembled that of a meditating
guru. Sadly, the joke was removed fairly early on (but there's a well-known
patch to restore it in more recent versions).
