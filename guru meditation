 :guru meditation: n. Amiga equivalent of `panic' in UNIX (sometimes just
called a `guru' or `guru event'). When the system crashes, a cryptic message
of the form "GURU MEDITATION #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" may appear, indicating what
the problem was. An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers.
Generally a {guru} event must be followed by a {Vulcan nerve pinch}. This
term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the Amiga. There
used to be a device called a `Joyboard' which was basically a plastic board
built onto a joystick-like device; it was sold with a skiing game cartridge
for the Atari game machine. It is said that whenever the prototype OS
crashed, the system programmer responsible would calm down by concentrating
on a solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep the
board in balance. This position resembled that of a meditating guru. Sadly,
the joke was removed in AmigaOS 2.04.
