 :lost in the underflow: /adj./ Too small to be worth considering; more
specifically, small beyond the limits of accuracy or measurement. This is a
reference to `floating underflow', a condition that can occur when a
floating-point arithmetic processor tries to handle quantities smaller than
its limit of magnitude. It is also a pun on `undertow' (a kind of fast, cold
current that sometimes runs just offshore and can be dangerous to swimmers).
"Well, sure, photon pressure from the stadium lights alters the path of a
thrown baseball, but that effect gets lost in the underflow." Compare
{epsilon}, {epsilon squared}; see also {overflow bit}.
