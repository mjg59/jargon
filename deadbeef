 :DEADBEEF: /dedÂ·beef/, n. The hexadecimal word-fill pattern for freshly
allocated memory under a number of IBM environments, including the RS/6000.
Some modern debugging tools deliberately fill freed memory with this value as
a way of converting {heisenbug}s into {Bohr bug}s. As in "Your program is
DEADBEEF" (meaning gone, aborted, flushed from memory); if you start from an
odd half-word boundary, of course, you have BEEFDEAD. see also the anecdote
under {fool} and {dead beef attack}.
