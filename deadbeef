 :DEADBEEF: /ded-beef/ n. The hexadecimal word-fill pattern for freshly
allocated memory (decimal -21524111) under a number of IBM environments,
including the RS/6000. As in "Your program is DEADBEEF" (meaning gone,
aborted, flushed from memory); if you start from an odd half-word boundary,
of course, you have BEEFDEAD.
