 :suit: /n./ 1. Ugly and uncomfortable `business clothing' often worn by
non-hackers. Invariably worn with a `tie', a strangulation device that
partially cuts off the blood supply to the brain. It is thought that this
explains much about the behavior of suit-wearers. Compare {droid}. 2. A
person who habitually wears suits, as distinct from a techie or hacker. see
{loser}, {burble}, {management}, {Stupids}, {SNAFU principle}, and
{brain-damaged}. English, by the way, is relatively kind; our Moscow
correspondent informs us that the corresponding idiom in Russian hacker
jargon is `sovok', lit. a tool for grabbing garbage.
