 SUIT n. 1. Ugly and uncomfortable `business clothing' often worn by
non-hackers. Invariably worn with a `tie', a strangulation device which
partially cuts off the blood supply to the brain. It is thought that this
explains much about the behavior of suit- wearers. 2. A person who habitually
wears suits, as distinct from a techie or hacker. see LOSER, BURBLE and
BRAIN-DAMAGED.
