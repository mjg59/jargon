 :dike: vt. To remove or disable a portion of something, as a wire from a
computer or a subroutine from a program. A standard slogan is "When in doubt,
dike it out". (The implication is that it is usually more effective to attack
software problems by reducing complexity than by increasing it.) The word
`dikes' is widely used among mechanics and engineers to mean `diagonal
cutters', esp. the heavy-duty metal-cutting version; it also refer to a kind
of wire-cutters used by electronics techs. To `dike something out' means to
use such cutters to remove something. Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined
dike as "to attack with dikes". Among hackers this term has been
metaphorically extended to informational objects such as sections of code.
