 DIKE vt. To remove or disable a portion of something, as a wire from a
computer or a subroutine from a program. A standard slogan runs: "When in
doubt, dike it out." (The implication is that it is usually more effective to
attack software problems by reducing complexity rather than increasing it).
The word "dikes" is widely used among mechanics and engineers to mean
"diagonal cutters", a heavy-duty metal-cutting device; to "dike something
out" means to use such cutters to remove something. Among hackers this term
has been metaphorically extended to non-physical objects such as sections of
code.
