 :TANSTAAFL: /tan'stah-fl/ [acronym, from Robert Heinlein's classic "The Moon
is a Harsh Mistress".] "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch", often
invoked when someone is balking at the prospect of using an unpleasantly
{heavyweight} technique, or at the poor quality of some piece of free
software, or at the {signal-to-noise ratio} of unmoderated USENET newsgroups.
"What? Don't tell me I have to implement a database back end to get my
address book program to work!" "Well, TANSTAAFL you know." This phrase owes
some of its popularity to the high concentration of science-fiction fans and
political libertarians in hackerdom (see {Appendix B}).
