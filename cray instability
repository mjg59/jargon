 :cray instability: n. 1. A shortcoming of a program or algorithm that
manifests itself only when a large problem is being run on a powerful machine
(see {cray}). Generally more subtle than bugs that can be detected in smaller
problems running on a workstation or mini. 2. More specifically, a
shortcoming of algorithms which are well behaved when run on gentle floating
point hardware (such as IEEE-standard or DEC) but which break down badly when
exposed to a Cray's unique `rounding' rules.
