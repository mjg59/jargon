 :four-color glossies: n. 1. Literature created by {marketroid}s that
allegedly contains technical specs but which is in fact as superficial as
possible without being totally {content-free}. "Forget the four-color
glossies, give me the tech ref manuals." Often applied as an indication of
superficiality even when the material is printed on ordinary paper in black
and white. Four-color-glossy manuals are *never* useful for finding a
problem. 2. [rare] Applied by extension to manual pages that don't contain
enough information to diagnose why the program doesn't produce the expected
or desired output.
