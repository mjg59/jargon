 :postcardware: n. A kind of {shareware} that borders on {freeware}, in that
the author requests only that satisfied users send a postcard of their home
town or something. (This practice, silly as it might seem, serves to remind
users that they are otherwise getting something for nothing, and may also be
psychologically related to real estate `sales' in which $1 changes hands just
to keep the transaction from being a gift.)
