 :teergrube: /teer'groob/ n. [German for `tar pit'] A trap set to punish
spammers who use an {address harvester}; a mail server deliberately set up to
be really, really slow. To activate it, scatter addresses that look like
users on the teergrube's host in places where the address harvester will be
trolling (one popular way is to embed the fake address in a Usenet sig block
next to a human-readable warning not to send mail to it). The address
harvester will dutifully collect the address. When the spammer tries to
mailbomb it, his mailer will get stuck.
