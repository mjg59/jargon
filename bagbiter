 BAGBITER (bag'biet-@r) n. 1. Something, such as a program or a computer,
that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy manner. Example: "This
text editor won't let me make a file with a line longer than 80 characters!
What a bagbiter!" 2. A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently
or otherwise, typically by failing to program the computer properly.
Synonyms: LOSER, CRETIN, CHOMPER. 3. Also in the form BAGBITING adj. Having
the quality of a bagbiter. `This bagbiting system won't let me compute the
factorial of a negative number.' Compare LOSING, CRETINOUS, BLETCHEROUS,
BARFUCIOUS and CHOMPING; and BITE THE BAG v. To fail in some manner. "The
computer keeps crashing every five minutes." "Yes, the disk controller is
really biting the bag." The original loading of these terms was almost
undoubtedly obscene, probably referring to the scrotum, but in their current
usage they have become almost completely sanitized.
