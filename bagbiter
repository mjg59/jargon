 :bagbiter: /bag'bi:t-*r/ n. 1. Something, such as a program or a computer,
that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy manner. "This text editor
won't let me make a file with a line longer than 80 characters! What a
bagbiter!" 2. A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently or
otherwise, typically by failing to program the computer properly. Synonyms:
{loser}, {cretin}, {chomper}. 3. `bite the bag' vi. To fail in some manner.
"The computer keeps crashing every five minutes." "Yes, the disk controller
is really biting the bag." The original loading of these terms was almost
undoubtedly obscene, possibly referring to a douche bag or the scrotum (we
have reports of "Bite the douche bag!" being used as a taunt at MIT
1970-1976, and we have another report that "Bite the bag!" was in common use
at least as early as 1965), but in their current usage they have become
almost completely sanitized. ITS's {lexiphage} program was the first and to
date only known example of a program _intended_ to be a bagbiter.
