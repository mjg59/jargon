 :bagbiter: /bag'bi:t-*r/ n. 1. Something, such as a program or a computer,
that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy manner. "This text editor
won't let me make a file with a line longer than 80 characters! What a
bagbiter!" 2. A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently or
otherwise, typically by failing to program the computer properly. Synonyms:
{loser}, {cretin}, {chomper}. 3. `bite the bag' vi. To fail in some manner.
"The computer keeps crashing every five minutes." "Yes, the disk controller
is really biting the bag." The original loading of these terms was almost
undoubtedly obscene, possibly referring to the scrotum, but in their current
usage they have become almost completely sanitized. ITS's {lexiphage} program
is the first and to date only known example of a program *intended* to be a
bagbiter.
