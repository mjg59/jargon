 :bagbiter: /bag'bi:t-*r/ n. 1. Something, such as a program or a computer,
that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy manner. "This text editor
won't let me make a file with a line longer than 80 characters! What a
bagbiter!" 2. A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently or
otherwise, typically by failing to program the computer properly. Synonyms:
{loser}, {cretin}, {chomper}. 3. adj. `bagbiting' Having the quality of a
bagbiter. "This bagbiting system won't let me compute the factorial of a
negative number." Compare {losing}, {cretinous}, {bletcherous}, `barfucious'
(under {barfulous}) and `chomping' (under {chomp}). 4. `bite the bag' vi. To
fail in some manner. "The computer keeps crashing every five minutes." "Yes,
the disk controller is really biting the bag." The original loading of these
terms was almost undoubtedly obscene, possibly referring to the scrotum, but
in their current usage they have become almost completely sanitized. A
program called Lexiphage on the old MIT AI PDP-10 would draw on a selected
victim's bitmapped terminal the words "THE BAG" in ornate letters, followed a
pair of jaws biting pieces of it off. This is the first and to date only
known example of a program *intended* to be a bagbiter.
