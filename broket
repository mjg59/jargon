 :broket: /broh´k@t/, /broh´ket`/, n. [rare; by analogy with `bracket': a
`broken bracket'] Either of the characters < and >, when used as paired
enclosing delimiters. This word originated as a contraction of the phrase
`broken bracket', that is, a bracket that is bent in the middle. (At MIT, and
apparently in the {Real World} as well, these are usually called {angle
brackets}.)
