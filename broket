 BROKET /broh'k@t/ or /broh'ket/ [by analogy with "bracket": a "broken
bracket"] (primarily Stanford) n. Either of the characters "<" and ">". This
word originated as a contraction of the phrase "broken bracket", that is, a
bracket that is bent in the middle. (At MIT, and apparently in THE REAL WORLD
(q.v.) as well, these are usually called ANGLE BRACKETS.)
