 :Borg: n. In "Star Trek: The Next Generation" the Borg is a species of
cyborg that ruthlessly seeks to incorporate all sentient life into itself;
their slogan is "You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile." In hacker
parlance, the Borg is usually {Microsoft}, which is thought to be trying just
as ruthlessly to assimilate all computers and the entire Internet to itself
(there is a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as a Borg). Being forced to
use Windows or NT is often referred to as being "Borged". Interestingly, the
{Halloween Documents} reveal that this jargon is live within Microsoft
itself. (Other companies, notably Intel and UUNet, have also occasionally
been equated to the Borg.) see also {Evil Empire}, {Internet Exploiter}. In
IETF circles, where direct pressure from Microsoft is not a daily reality,
the Borg is sometimes Cisco. This usage commemorates their tendency to pay
any price to hire talent away from their competitors. In fact, at the Spring
1997 IETF, a large number of ex-Cisco employees, all former members of
Routing Geeks, showed up with t-shirts printed with "Recovering Borg".
