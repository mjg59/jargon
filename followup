 :followup: n. On USENET, a {posting} generated in response to another
posting (as opposed to a {reply}, which goes by email rather than being
broadcast). Followups include the ID of the {parent message} in their
headers; smart news-readers can use this information to present USENET news
in `conversation' sequence rather than order-of-arrival. see {thread}.
