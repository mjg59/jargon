 BOMB vi. 1. General synonym for CRASH, esp. used of software or OS failures.
"Don't run Empire with less than 32K stack, it'll bomb out" 2. Atari ST and
Macintosh equivalents of PANIC or GURU (sense 2), where icons of little
black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed indicating the system has
died. On the Mac this may be accomanied by a hexadecimal number indicating
what went wrong, similar to the Amiga GURU MEDITION number. MESS-DOS machines
tend to get LOCKED UP in this situation.
