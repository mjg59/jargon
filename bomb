 :bomb: 1. v. General synonym for {crash} (sense 1) except that it is not
used as a noun; esp. used of software or OS failures. "Don't run Empire with
less than 32K stack, it'll bomb." 2. n.,v. Atari ST and Macintosh equivalents
of a UNIX `panic' or Amiga {guru} (sense 2), where icons of little
black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed, indicating that the
system has died. On the Mac, this may be accompanied by a decimal (or
occasionally hexadecimal) number indicating what went wrong, similar to the
Amiga {guru meditation} number. {{MS-DOS}} machines tend to get {locked up}
in this situation.
