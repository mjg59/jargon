 :gib: /jib/ 1. vi. To destroy utterly. Like {frag}, but much more violent
and final. "There's no trace left. You definitely gibbed that bug". 2. n.
Remnants after total obliteration. Popilarized by id software in the game
Quake, but actually goes back to an earlier game called Rise of the Triad.
It's short for giblets (thus pronounced "jib"), and referred to the bloody
remains of slain opponents. Eventually the word was verbed, and leaked into
general usage afterward.
