 BNF: /bee-en-ef/ n. 1. Acronym for `Backus-Naur Form', a metasyntactic
notation used to specify the syntax of programming languages, command sets
and the like. Widely used for language descriptions but seldom documented
anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from other hackers.
Consider this BNF for a postal address: <postal-address> ::= <name-part>
<street-address> <zip-part> <name-part> ::= <first-name> [<middle-part>]
<last-name> <EOL> <middle-part> ::= <middle-name> | <middle-initial> "."
<street-address> ::= [<apt>] <street-number> <street-name> <EOL> <zip-part>
::= <town-name> "," <state-code> <zip-code> <EOL> of a name-part, followed by
a street-address part, followed by a zip-code part. A name-part consists of a
first-name followed by an optional middle-part followed by a last-name. A
middle-part consists of either a middle name or a middle initial followed by
a dot. A street address consists of an optional apartment specifier followed
by a street number, followed by a street name. A zip-part consts of a
town-name, followed by a state code, followed by a zip-code. Note that many
things such as the format of a first-name, apartment specifier or zip-code
are left unspecified. These are presumed to be obvious from context or
detailed somewhere nearby. see also {parse}. A major reason BNF is listed
here is that the term is also used loosely for any number of variants and
extensions, possibly containing some or all of the {glob} wildcards. 2. In
{{Science-Fiction Fandom}}, BNF expands to `Big Name Fan' (someone famous or
notorious). Years ago a fan started handing out black-on-green BNF buttons at
SF conventions. This confused the hacker contingent terribly. boa: [IBM] n.
Any one of the fat cables that lurk under the floor in a {dinosaur pen}.
Possibly so called because they display a ferocious life of their own when
you try to lay them straight and flat after they have been coiled for some
time. It is rumored within IBM that 370 channel cables are limited to 200
feet because beyond that length the boas get dangerous ... and it is worth
noting that one of the major cable makers uses the trademark `Anaconda'. boat
anchor: n. 1. Like {doorstop} but more severe, implies that the offending
hardware is irreversibly dead or useless. 2. Also used of people who just
take up space. bogo-sort: n. The generic bad algorithm. The origin is a
fictitious contest at CMU to design the worst running time sort algorithm
(apparently after a student found an n^3 algorithm to do sorting while trying
to design a good one). Bogo-sort is equivalent to throwing a deck of cards in
the air, picking them up, then testing whether they are in order. If not,
repeat. Usage: when one is looking at a program and sees a dumb algorithm,
one might say "Oh, I see, this program uses bogo-sort." Compare {bubble
sort}, {bogus}, {brute force}. bogometer: n. see {bogosity}. bogon: /boh'gon/
[by analogy with proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless reinforced after 1980
by the similarity to Douglas Adams's `Vogons', see Appendix C] n. 1. The
elementary particle of bogosity (see {quantum bogodynamics}). For instance,
"the ethernet is emitting bogons again", meaning that it is broken or acting
in an erratic or bogus fashion. 2. A query packet sent from a TCP/IP domain
resolver to a root server, having the reply bit set instead of the query bit.
3. Any bogus or incorrectly formed packet sent on a network. 4. By
synecdoche, used to refer to any bogus thing, as in "I'd like to go to lunch
with you but I've got to go to the weekly staff bogon." 5. A person who is
bogus or who says bogus things. This was historically the original usage, but
has been overtaken by its derivatives in 1-4. bogon filter: /boh'gon fil'tr/
n. Any device, software or hardware, which limits or suppresses the flow
and/or emission of bogons. Example: "Engineering hacked a bogon filter
between the Cray and the VAXen and now we're getting fewer dropped packets."
bogosity: /boh-go's@-tee/ n. 1. The degree to which something is {bogus}. At
CMU, bogosity is measured with a {bogometer}; typical use: in a seminar, when
a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say, "My
bogometer just triggered.". More extremely, "You just pinned my bogometer."
means "You just said or did something so outrageously bogus that it is off
the scale (pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible reading).".
The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the microLenat (uL). The consensus is
that this is the largest unit practical for everyday use. 2. The potential
field generated by a bogon flux; see {quantum bogodynamics}. [Historical
note: microLenat was invented as a attack against noted computer scientist
Doug Lenat by a {tenured graduate student}. Doug had failed him on the AI
Qual after the student gave "AI is bogus" as his answer to the questions. The
slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has become a running gag
nevertheless. Some of Doug's friends argue that `of course' a microLenat is
bogus, since it's only one millionth of a Lenat. Others have suggested that
the unit should be re-designated after the grad student, as the microReid.]
bogotify: /boh-go't@-fie/ vt. To make or become bogus. A program that has
been changed so many times as to become completely disorganized has become
bogotified. If you tighten a nut too hard and strip the threads on the bolt,
the bolt has become bogotified and you'd better not use it any more. This
coinage led to the notional `autobogotiphobia' /aw'to-boh-got'@-foh`bee-uh/
n., defined as the fear of becoming bogotified; but is not clear that the
latter has ever been `live' slang rather than a self-conscious joke in jargon
about jargon. bogue out: /bohg owt/ vi. To becomes bogus, suddenly and
unexpectedly. "His talk was relatively sane until somebody asked him a trick
question, then he bogued out and did nothing but {flame} afterwards." bogus:
[WPI, Yale, Stanford] adj. 1. Non-functional. "Your patches are bogus." 2.
Useless. "OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your arguments are bogus." 4.
Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Unbelievable. "You claim to have
solved the halting problem for Turing Machines? That's totally bogus." 6.
Silly. "Stop writing those bogus sagas." Astrology is bogus. So is a bolt
that is obviously about to break. So is someone who makes blatantly false
claims to have solved a scientific problem. (This word seems to have some,
but not all, of the connotations of {random}.) It is claimed that `bogus' was
originally used in the hackish sense at Princeton, in the late 1960s. A
glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was first
popularized (see {autobogotiphobia} under {bogotify}). By the early 1980s it
was also current in something like the hackish sense in West Coast teen
slang, and it had gone mainstream by 1985. A correspondent at Cambridge
reports, by contrast, that these uses of bogus grate on British nerves; in
Britain the word means rather specifically `counterfeit' as in "a bogus pound
note". Bohr bug: /bohr buhg/ [from quantum physics] n. A repeatable {bug};
one which manifests reliably under a possibly unknown but well-defined set of
conditions. Antonym of {heisenbug}. boink: /boynk/ [USENET, perh. from the TV
series `Moonlighting'] 1. To have sex with; compare {bounce}, sense #3. (This
is mainstream) In Commonwealth hackish the variant `bonk' is more common. 2.
After the original Peter Korn `Boinkon' {USENET} parties, used for almost any
net social gathering, e.g. Miniboink, a small boink held by Nancy Gillett in
1988; Minniboink, a Boinkcon in Minnesota in 1989; Humpdayboinks, Wednesday
get-togethers held in the San Francisco Bay Area. Compare {@-party}. bomb: v.
1. General synonym for {crash}, esp. used of software or OS failures. "Don't
run Empire with less than 32K stack, it'll bomb out." 2. Atari ST and
Macintosh equivalents of {panic} or {guru} (sense 2), where icons of little
black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed indicating the system has
died. On the Mac this may be accompanied by a decimal (or occasionally
hexadecimal) number indicating what went wrong, similar to the Amiga GURU
MEDITATION number. {Mess-dos} machines tend to get {locked up} in this
situation. bondage-and-discipline language: A language such as Pascal, APL,
or Prolog that, though ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to
enforce an author's theory of "right programming" even though said theory is
demonstrably inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose
programming. Often abbreviated `B&D'; thus, one may speak of things "having
the B&D nature" etc. see {{Pascal}}; oppose {languages of choice}. bonk/oif:
/bonk/, /oyf/ interj. In the {MUD} community, it has become traditional to
express pique or censure by `bonking' the offending person. There is a
convention that one should acknowledge a bonk by saying `oif!' and a myth to
the effect that failing to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif balance, causing
much trouble in the universe. Some MUDs have implemented special commands for
bonking and oifing. see also {talk mode}, {posing}. boot: [from `by one's
bootstraps'] vi.,n. To load and initialize the operating system on a machine.
This usage is no longer slang (having become jargon in the strict sense), but
it is sometimes used of human thought processes, as in the following
exchange: "You've lost me." "O.K., reboot. Here's the theory....". Also found
in the variants `cold boot' (from power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with
the CPU and all devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or
software crash). Another variant: `soft boot', re-initialization of only part
of a system, under control of other software that's still running: "If you're
running the {mess-dos} emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of
the emulator, while leaving the rest of the system running." Opposed to this
there is `hard boot', which connotes hostility towards or frustration with
the machine being booted. "I'll have to hard-boot this losing Sun" or "I
recommend booting it hard." Historically, this term derives from `bootstrap
loader', a short program meant to reside in a fixed location on a disk. The
machine would be hardwired to load the bootstrap from this `boot block' and
hand control to it; the bootstrap would in turn load the actual OS and hand
control to it. This was thought of as the software pulling itself up by its
bootstraps. bottom-up implementation: n. Hackish opposite of the straight
technical term `top-down design'. It is now received wisdom in most
programming cultures that it is best to design from higher levels of
abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences of action in increasing
detail until you get to actual code. Hackers often find (especially in
exploratory designs which cannot be closely specified in advance) that it
works best to `build' things in the opposite order, by writing and testing a
clean set of primitive operations and then knitting them together. bounce: v.
1. [UNIX, perhaps from the image of a thrown ball bouncing off a wall] An
electronic mail message which is undeliverable and returns an error
notification to the sender is said to `bounce'. see also {bounce message}. 2.
[Stanford] To play volleyball. At one time there was a volleyball court next
to the computer laboratory. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM was the scheduled
maintenance time for the computer, so every afternoon at 5:00 the computer
would become unavailable, and over the intercom a voice would cry , "Bounce,
bounce!" 3. To engage in sexual intercourse; prob. from the expression
`bouncing the mattress', but influenced by Piglet's psychosexually loaded
"Bounce on me too, Tigger!" from the Winnie-the-Pooh books. Compare {boink}.
4. To casually reboot a system in order to clear up a transient problem.
Reported primarily among {VMS} users. 5. [IBM] To {power cycle} a peripheral
in order to reset it. bounce message: [UNIX] n. Notification message returned
to sender by a site unable to relay {email} to the intended {{Internet
address}} recipient or the next link in a {bang path} (see {bounce}). Reasons
might include a nonexistent or misspelled username or a down relay site.
Bounce messages can themselves fail, with occasionally ugly results; see
{sorcerer's apprentice mode}. The collective `bounce mail' is also common.
box: n. 1. [within IBM] A computer; esp. in the construction "foo box" where
foo is some functional qualifier, like `graphics', or the name of an OS
(thus, `UNIX box', `MS-DOS box', etc. 2. Without qualification but within an
SNA-using site (see {Blue Glue}), this refers specifically to an IBM
front-end processor or FEP /eff-ee-pee/. An FEP is a small computer necessary
to enable an IBM {mainframe} to communicate beyond the limits of the
{dinosaur pen}. Typically used in expressions like the cry that goes up when
an SNA network goes down, "Looks like the {box} has fallen over." (see {fall
over}) see also {IBM}, {fear and loathing}, {Blue Glue}. boxed comments: n.
Comments (explanatory notes in code) which occupy several lines by
themselves; so called because in assembler and C code they are often
surrounded by a box in a style something like this:
/************************************************* * * This is a boxed
comment in C style * *************************************************/
Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column two or add a
matching row of asterisks closing the right end of the box. The sparest
variant omits all but the comment delimiters at the extreme left; the `box'
is implied. Oppose {winged comments}. boxen: /bok'sn/ pl n. [by analogy with
{VAXen}] Fanciful plural of {box} often encountered in the phrase `UNIX
boxen', used to describe commodity {UNIX} hardware. The connotation is that
any two UNIX boxen are interchangeable. boxology: /bok-sol'@-jee/ n. 1. The
fine art of drawing diagrams using the `box' characters (mainly, `|', `-',
and `+') in ASCII-monospace fonts. Also known as `character graphics' or
`ASCII graphics'. 2. Boxological drawings. "His report has a lot of boxology
in it". brain dump: n. The act of telling someone everything one knows about
a particular topic or project. Typically used when someone is going to let a
new party maintain a piece of code. Analogous to an operating system {core
dump} in the sense that the state of the person's important "registers" are
saved before exiting. Example: "You'll have to give me a brain dump on
FOOBAR, before you start your new job at HackerCorp." see {core dump} (sense
#4). At Sun, this is also known as `TOI' (transfer of information).
brain-damaged: [generalization of `Honeywell Brain Damage' (HBD), a
theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in Honeywell
{Multics}] adj. Obviously wrong; {cretinous}; {demented}. There is an
implication that the person responsible must have suffered brain damage,
because he should have known better. Calling something brain-damaged is
really bad; it also implies it is unusable, and that its failure to work is
due to poor design rather than some accident. brain-dead: adj. Brain-damaged
in the extreme. Not quite like mainstream use, as it tends to imply terminal
design failure rather than malfunction or simple stupidity. braino: /bray'no/
n. Syn. for {thinko}. branch to Fishkill: [IBM, from the location of one of
their facilities] n. Any unexpected jump in a program that produces
catastrophic or just plain weird results. see {jump off into never-never
land}. brand brand brand: n. Humorous catch-phrase from {BartleMUD}s, in
which players were described carrying a list of objects, the most common of
which would usually be a brand. Often used as a joke in {talk mode} as in
"Fred the wizard is here, carrying brand ruby brand brand brand kettle
broadsword flamethrower". Prob. influenced by the infamous Monty Python
{Spam} skit. break: 1. vt. To cause to be broken (in any sense). "Your latest
patch to the editor broke the paragraph commands." 2. v. (of a program) To
stop temporarily, so that it may debugged. The place where it stops is a
"breakpoint". 3. vi. To send an RS-232 break (125 msec. of line high) over a
serial comm line. 4. [UNIX] vi. To strike whatever key currently causes the
tty driver to send SIGINT to the current process. Normally break (sense 3) or
delete does this. breakage: 1. Brokenness and the consequent mess. 2.[IBM] n.
The extra people that must be added to an organization because its master
plan has changed; used esp. of software and hardware development teams.
breath-of-life packet: [Xerox PARC] n. An Ethernet packet that contained
bootstrap code, periodically sent out from a working computer to infuse the
`breath of life' into any computer on the network that had happened to crash.
The machines had hardware or firmware that would wait for such a packet after
a catastrophic error. bring X to its knees: v. Of a machine, operating
system, piece of software, or algorithm; to present it with a load so extreme
or pathological that it grinds virtually to a halt. "To bring a MicroVAX to
its knees, try twenty users running {vi} --- or four running {EMACS}."
Compare {hog}. brittle: adj. Said of software that's functional but easily
broken by changes in operating environment or configuration, or by any minor
tweak to the software itself. Often describes the results of a research
effort that were never intended to be robust, but can be applied to
commercially developed software. Oppose {robust}. broadcast storm: n. An
incorrect packet broadcast on a network that causes most hosts to respond all
at once, typically with wrong answers that start the process over again. Also
called `network meltdown'. see also {Chernobyl packet}. broken: adj. 1. Not
working properly (of programs). 2. Behaving strangely; especially, (when used
of people) exhibiting extreme depression. broket: /broh'k@t/ or /broh'ket/
[by analogy with `bracket': a `broken bracket'] n. Either of the characters
`<' and `>', when used as paired enclosing delimiters. This word originated
as a contraction of the phrase `broken bracket', that is, a bracket that is
bent in the middle. (At MIT, and apparently in the {Real World} as well,
these are usually called {angle brackets}.) Brooks's Law: prov. "Adding
manpower to a late software project makes it later" --- a result of the fact
that the advantage from splitting work between N programmers is O(N), but the
complexity and communications cost associated with coordinating and then
merging their work is O(N^2). The quote is from Fred Brooks, a manager of
IBMs OS/360 project and author of `The Mythical Man-Month', an excellent
early book on software engineering. Hackers have never forgotten this advice;
too often, {management} does.
