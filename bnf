 BNF (bee-en-ef) n. Hacker acronym for `Backus-Naur Form', a metasyntactic
notation used to specify the syntax of programming languages, command sets
and the like. Widely used for language descriptions but seldom documented
anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from other hackers.
Consider this BNF for a postal address: <postal-address> ::= <name-part>
<street-address> <zip-part> <name-part> ::= <first-name> [<middle-part>]
<last-name> <middle-part> ::= <middle-name> | <middle-initial> "."
<street-address> ::= [<apt>] <street-number> <street-name> <zip-part> ::=
<town-name> "," <state-code> <zip-code> This translates into English as: A
postal-address consists of a name-part, followed by a street-address part,
followed by a zip-code part. A name-part consists of a first-name followed by
an optional middle-part followed by a last-name. A middle-part consists of
either a middle name or a middle initial followed by a dot. A street address
consists of an optional apartment specifier followed by a street number,
followed by a street name. A zip-part consts of a town-name, followed by a
state code, followed by a zip code. Note that many things such as the format
of a first-name, apartment specifier or zip-code are left unspecified. These
are presumed to be obvious from context or detailed in another part of the
specification the BNF is part of.
