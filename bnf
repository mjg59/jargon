 BNF: /bee-en-ef/ n. 1. [techspeak] Acronym for `Backus-Naur Form', a
metasyntactic notation used to specify the syntax of programming languages,
command sets and the like. Widely used for language descriptions but seldom
documented anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from other
hackers. Consider this BNF for a postal address: <postal-address> ::=
<name-part> <street-address> <zip-part> <name-part> ::= <first-name>
[<middle-part>] <last-name> <EOL> <middle-part> ::= <middle-name> |
<middle-initial> "." <street-address> ::= [<apt>] <street-number>
<street-name> <EOL> <zip-part> ::= <town-name> "," <state-code> <zip-code>
<EOL> This translates into English as: A postal-address consists of a
name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a zip-code part. A
name-part consists of a first-name followed by an optional middle-part
followed by a last-name. A middle-part consists of either a middle name or a
middle initial followed by a dot. A street address consists of an optional
apartment specifier followed by a street number, followed by a street name. A
zip-part consts of a town-name, followed by a state code, followed by a
zip-code. Note that many things such as the format of a first-name, apartment
specifier, or zip-code are left unspecified. These are presumed to be obvious
from context or detailed somewhere nearby. see also {parse}. A major reason
BNF is listed here is that the term is also used loosely for any number of
variants and extensions, possibly containing some or all of the {glob}
wildcards. In fact the example above isn't the pure form invented for the
Algol-60 report; it uses [], which was introduced a few years later in IBM's
PL/I definition but is now universally recognized. 2. In {{Science-Fiction
Fandom}}, BNF expands to `Big Name Fan' (someone famous or notorious). Years
ago a fan started handing out black-on-green BNF buttons at SF conventions.
This confused the hacker contingent terribly. boa: [IBM] n. Any one of the
fat cables that lurk under the floor in a {dinosaur pen}. Possibly so called
because they display a ferocious life of their own when you try to lay them
straight and flat after they have been coiled for some time. It is rumored
within IBM that 370 channel cables are limited to 200 feet because beyond
that length the boas get dangerous ... and it is worth noting that one of the
major cable makers uses the trademark `Anaconda'. board: n. 1. In-context
synonym for {bboard}; sometimes used even for USENET newsgroups. 2. An
electronic circuit board (compare {card}). boat anchor: n. 1. Like {doorstop}
but more severe; implies that the offending hardware is irreversibly dead or
useless. 2. Also used of people who just take up space. bogo-sort: n. (var.
`stupid-sort') The archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to
{bubble sort}, which is merely the generic *bad* algorithm). Bogo-sort is
equivalent to throwing a deck of cards in the air, picking them up, then
testing whether they are in order. If not, repeat. Used as a sort of
canonical example of awfulness. Usage: when one is looking at a program and
sees a dumb algorithm, one might say "Oh, I see, this program uses
bogo-sort." Compare {bogus}, {brute force}. bogometer: n. see {bogosity}.
Compare the `wankometer' described in the {wank} entry, also {bogus}. bogon:
/boh'gon/ [by analogy with proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless reinforced
after 1980 by the similarity to Douglas Adams's `Vogons', see Appendix C] n.
1. The elementary particle of bogosity (see {quantum bogodynamics}). For
instance, "the Ethernet is emitting bogons again", meaning that it is broken
or acting in an erratic or bogus fashion. 2. A query packet sent from a
TCP/IP domain resolver to a root server, having the reply bit set instead of
the query bit. 3. Any bogus or incorrectly formed packet sent on a network.
4. By synecdoche, used to refer to any bogus thing, as in "I'd like to go to
lunch with you but I've got to go to the weekly staff bogon." 5. A person who
is bogus or who says bogus things. This was historically the original usage,
but has been overtaken by its derivative senses 1--4. see also {bogosity},
{bogus}; compare {psyton}. bogon filter: /boh'gon fil'tr/ n. Any device,
software or hardware, which limits or suppresses the flow and/or emission of
bogons. Example: "Engineering hacked a bogon filter between the Cray and the
VAXen and now we're getting fewer dropped packets." see also {bogosity},
{bogus}. bogosity: /boh-go's*-tee/ n. 1. The degree to which something is
{bogus}. At CMU, bogosity is measured with a {bogometer}; typical use: in a
seminar, when a speaker says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand
and say, "My bogometer just triggered.". More extremely, "You just pinned my
bogometer." means you just said or did something so outrageously bogus that
it is off the scale, pinning the bogometer needle at the highest possible
reading (one might also say "You just redlined my bogometer."). The
agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the microLenat (uL). The consensus is that
this is the largest unit practical for everyday use. 2. The potential field
generated by a bogon flux; see {quantum bogodynamics}. see also {bogosity},
{bogus}. [Historical note: microLenat was invented as a attack against noted
computer scientist Doug Lenat by a {tenured graduate student}. Doug had
failed him on the AI Qual after the student gave "AI is bogus" as his answer
to the questions. The slur is generally considered unmerited, but it has
become a running gag nevertheless. Some of Doug's friends argue that `of
course' a microLenat is bogus, since it's only one millionth of a Lenat.
Others have suggested that the unit should be re-designated after the grad
student, as the microReid.] bogotify: /boh-go't*-fie/ vt. To make or become
bogus. A program that has been changed so many times as to become completely
disorganized has become bogotified. If you tighten a nut too hard and strip
the threads on the bolt, the bolt has become bogotified and you'd better not
use it any more. This coinage led to the notional `autobogotiphobia'
/aw'to-boh-got'*-foh`bee-uh/ n., defined as the fear of becoming bogotified;
but is not clear that the latter has ever been `live' jargon rather than a
self-conscious joke in jargon about jargon. see also {bogosity}, {bogus}.
bogue out: /bohg owt/ vi. To become bogus, suddenly and unexpectedly. "His
talk was relatively sane until somebody asked him a trick question; then he
bogued out and did nothing but {flame} afterwards." see also {bogosity},
{bogus}. bogus: adj. 1. Non-functional. "Your patches are bogus." 2. Useless.
"OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your arguments are bogus." 4.
Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Unbelievable. "You claim to have
solved the halting problem for Turing Machines? That's totally bogus." 6.
Silly. "Stop writing those bogus sagas." Astrology is bogus. So is a bolt
that is obviously about to break. So is someone who makes blatantly false
claims to have solved a scientific problem. (This word seems to have some,
but not all, of the connotations of {random}.) It is claimed that `bogus' was
originally used in the hackish sense at Princeton, in the late 1960s. It was
spread to CMU and Yale by Michal Shamos, a migratory Princeton alumnus. A
glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was first
popularized (see {autobogotiphobia} under {bogotify}). The word spread into
hackerdom from CMU and MIT. By the early 1980s, it was also current in
something like the hackish sense in West Coast teen slang, and it had gone
mainstream by 1985. A correspondent at Cambridge reports, by contrast, that
these uses of `bogus' grate on British nerves; in Britain the word means
rather specifically `counterfeit' as in "a bogus pound note". Bohr bug: /bohr
buhg/ [from quantum physics] n. A repeatable {bug}; one which manifests
reliably under a possibly unknown but well-defined set of conditions. Antonym
of {heisenbug}. boink: /boynk/ [USENET, perh. from the TV series `Cheers' and
`Moonlighting'] 1. To have sex with; compare {bounce}, sense #3. (This is
mainstream slang.) In Commonwealth hackish the variant `bonk' is more common.
2. After the original Peter Korn `Boinkon' {USENET} parties, used for almost
any net social gathering, e.g. Miniboink, a small boink held by Nancy Gillett
in 1988; Minniboink, a Boinkcon in Minnesota in 1989; Humpdayboinks,
Wednesday get-togethers held in the San Francisco Bay Area. Compare
{@-party}. 3. Var of `bonk'; see {bonk/oif}. bomb: 1. v. General synonym for
{crash} (sense #1), esp. used of software or OS failures. "Don't run Empire
with less than 32K stack, it'll bomb out." 2. n.,v. Atari ST and Macintosh
equivalents of a UNIX `panic' or Amiga {guru} (sense 2), where icons of
little black-powder bombs or mushroom clouds are displayed indicating the
system has died. On the Mac, this may be accompanied by a decimal (or
occasionally hexadecimal) number indicating what went wrong, similar to the
Amiga GURU MEDITATION number (see {guru}). {MS-DOS} machines tend to get
{locked up} in this situation. bondage-and-discipline language: A language
such as Pascal, Ada, APL, or Prolog that, though ostensibly general-purpose,
is designed so as to enforce an author's theory of `right programming' even
though said theory is demonstrably inadequate for systems hacking or even
vanilla general-purpose programming. Often abbreviated `B&D'; thus, one may
speak of things "having the B&D nature", etc. see {{Pascal}}; oppose
{languages of choice}. bonk/oif: /bonk/, /oyf/ interj. In the {MUD}
community, it has become traditional to express pique or censure by `bonking'
the offending person. There is a convention that one should acknowledge a
bonk by saying `oif!' and a myth to the effect that failing to do so upsets
the cosmic bonk/oif balance, causing much trouble in the universe. Some MUDs
have implemented special commands for bonking and oifing. see also {talk
mode}, {posing}. book titles:: There is a tradition in hackerdom of
informally tagging important textbooks and standards documents with the
dominant color of their covers or with some other conspicuous feature of the
cover. Many of these are described in this lexicon under their own entries.
see also {Aluminum Book}, {Blue Book}, {Cinderella Book}, {Devil Book},
{Dragon Book}, {Green Book}, {Orange Book}, {Pink-Shirt Book}, {Purple Book},
{Red Book}, {Silver Book}, {White Book}, {Wizard Book}, {Yellow Book}. boot:
[techspeak; from `by one's bootstraps'] v.,n. To load and initialize the
operating system on a machine. This usage is no longer jargon but has given
rise to some derivatives which still are. The derivative `reboot' implies
that the machine hasn't been down for long, even that the boot is a {bounce}
intended to clear some state of {wedgitude}. This is sometimes used of human
thought processes, as in the following exchange: "You've lost me." "O.K.,
reboot. Here's the theory...." Also found in the variants `cold boot' (from
power-off condition) and `warm boot' (with the CPU and all devices already
powered up, as after a hardware reset or software crash). Another variant:
`soft boot', re-initialization of only part of a system, under control of
other software that's still running: "If you're running the {mess-dos}
emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while
leaving the rest of the system running." Opposed to this there is `hard
boot', which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the machine being
booted. "I'll have to hard-boot this losing Sun" or "I recommend booting it
hard." Historical note: this term derives from `bootstrap loader', a short
program which was read in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the
front panel switches. This program was always very short (great efforts were
expended on making it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of
error involved in toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a
slightly more complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to
which it handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive.
Thus, in successive steps, the computer "pulled itself up by its bootstraps"
to a useful operating state. Nowadays the bootstrap is usually found in ROM
or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed location on the disk,
called the `boot block'. When this program gains control, it is powerful
enough to load the actual OS and hand control over to it. bottom-up
implementation: n. Hackish opposite of the techspeak term `top-down design'.
It is now received wisdom in most programming cultures that it is best to
design from higher levels of abstraction down to lower, specifying sequences
of action in increasing detail until you get to actual code. Hackers often
find (especially in exploratory designs which cannot be closely specified in
advance) that it works best to `build' things in the opposite order, by
writing and testing a clean set of primitive operations and then knitting
them together. bounce: v. 1. [UNIX, perhaps from the image of a thrown ball
bouncing off a wall] An electronic mail message which is undeliverable and
returns an error notification to the sender is said to `bounce'. see also
{bounce message}. 2. [Stanford] To play volleyball. At the now-demolished DC
Power building used by the Stanford AI Lab in the 1970's there was a
volleyball court on the front lawn. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM was the scheduled
maintenance time for the computer, so every afternoon at 5:00 the computer
would become unavailable, and over the intercom a voice would cry , "Now hear
this: bounce, bounce!" followed by Brian McCune loudly bouncing a volleyball
on the floor outside the offices of known volleyballers. 3. To engage in
sexual intercourse; prob. from the expression `bouncing the mattress', but
influenced by Piglet's psychosexually loaded "Bounce on me too, Tigger!" from
the Winnie-the-Pooh books. Compare {boink}. 4. To casually reboot a system in
order to clear up a transient problem. Reported primarily among {VMS} users.
5. [IBM] To {power cycle} a peripheral in order to reset it. bounce message:
[UNIX] n. Notification message returned to sender by a site unable to relay
{email} to the intended {{Internet address}} recipient or the next link in a
{bang path} (see {bounce}). Reasons might include a nonexistent or misspelled
username or a down relay site. Bounce messages can themselves fail, with
occasionally ugly results; see {sorcerer's apprentice mode}. The collective
`bounce mail' is also common. box: n. 1. A computer; esp. in the construction
"foo box" where foo is some functional qualifier, like `graphics', or the
name of an OS (thus, `UNIX box', `MS-DOS box', etc. 2. [within IBM] Without
qualification but within an SNA-using site (see {Blue Glue}), this refers
specifically to an IBM front-end processor or FEP /eff-ee-pee/. An FEP is a
small computer necessary to enable an IBM {mainframe} to communicate beyond
the limits of the {dinosaur pen}. Typically used in expressions like the cry
that goes up when an SNA network goes down, "Looks like the {box} has fallen
over." (see {fall over}.) see also {IBM}, {fear and loathing}, {fepped out},
{Blue Glue}. boxed comments: n. Comments (explanatory notes in code) which
occupy several lines by themselves; so called because in assembler and C code
they are often surrounded by a box in a style something like this:
/************************************************* * * This is a boxed
comment in C style * *************************************************/
Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column two or add a
matching row of asterisks closing the right end of the box. The sparest
variant omits all but the comment delimiters at the extreme left; the `box'
is implied. Oppose {winged comments}. boxen: /bok'sn/ [by analogy with
{VAXen}] pl.n. Fanciful plural of {box} often encountered in the phrase `UNIX
boxen', used to describe commodity {UNIX} hardware. The connotation is that
any two UNIX boxen are interchangeable. boxology: /bok-sol'*-jee/ n. 1. The
fine art of drawing diagrams using the `box' characters (mainly, `|', `-',
and `+') in ASCII-monospace fonts. Also known as `character graphics' or
`ASCII graphics'. 2. Boxological drawings. "His report has a lot of boxology
in it". Compare {macrology}. bozotic: /boh-zoh'tik/ [from a TV clown even
more losing than Ronald McDonald] adj. Resembling or having the quality of a
bozo; that is, clownish, ludicrously wrong, unintentionally humorous. Compare
{wonky}, {demented}. Note that the noun `bozo' occurs in slang, but the
mainstream adjectival form would be `bozo-like' or (in New England)
`bozoish'; the formation `bozotic' is hackish.
