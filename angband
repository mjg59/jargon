 :Angband: n., /angÂ´band/ Like {nethack}, {moria}, and {rogue}, one of the
large freely distributed Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation games,
available for a wide range of machines and operating systems. The name is
from Tolkien's Pits of Angband (compare {elder days}, {elvish}). Has been
described as "Moria on steroids"; but, unlike Moria, many aspects of the game
are customizable. This leads many hackers and would-be hackers into fooling
with these instead of doing productive work. There are many Angband variants,
of which the most notorious is probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In
this game, when a key that does not correspond to a command is pressed, the
game will display "Type ? for help" 50% of the time. The other 50% of the
time, random error messages including "An error has occurred because an error
of type 42 has occurred" and "Windows 95 uninstalled successfully" will be
displayed. Zangband also allows the player to kill Santa Claus (who has some
really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends), "Bull Gates", and Barney
the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney has a nasty case of halitosis). There
is an official angband home page at http://thangorodrim.angband.org/ and a
zangband one at http://www.zangband.org/. see also {Random Number God}.
