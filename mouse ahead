 MOUSE AHEAD v. To manipulate a computer's pointing device (almost always a
mouse in this usage, but not necessarily) and its selection or command
buttons before a computer program is ready to accept such input, in
anticipation of the program accepting the input. Handling this properly is
rare, but it can help make a USER FRIENDLY program usable by real users,
assuming they are familiar with the behavior of the user interface.
Point-and-click analog of "type ahead".
