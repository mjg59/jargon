 :mouse ahead: /vi./ Point-and-click analog of `type ahead'. To manipulate a
computer's pointing device (almost always a mouse in this usage, but not
necessarily) and its selection or command buttons before a computer program
is ready to accept such input, in anticipation of the program accepting the
input. Handling this properly is rare, but it can help make a {WIMP
environment} much more usable, assuming the users are familiar with the
behavior of the user interface.
