 :by hand: adv. Said of an operation (especially a repetitive, trivial,
and/or tedious one) that ought to be performed automatically by the computer,
but which a hacker instead has to step tediously through. "My mailer doesn't
have a command to include the text of the message I'm replying to, so I have
to do it by hand." This does not necessarily mean the speaker has to retype a
copy of the message; it might refer to, say, dropping into a {subshell} from
the mailer, making a copy of one's mailbox file, reading that into an editor,
locating the top and bottom of the message in question, deleting the rest of
the file, inserting `>' characters on each line, writing the file, leaving
the editor, returning to the mailer, reading the file in, and later
remembering to delete the file. Compare {eyeball search}.
