 PPN (pip'in) [DEC terminology, short for Project-Programmer Number] n. 1. A
combination "project" (directory name) and programmer name, used to identify
a specific direc- tory belonging to that user. For instance, "FOO,BAR" would
be the FOO directory for user BAR. Since the name is restricted to three
letters, the programmer name is usually the person's initials, though
sometimes it is a nickname or other special sequence. (Standard DEC setup is
to have two octal numbers instead of characters; hence the original acronym.)
2. Often used loosely to refer to the programmer name alone. "I want to send
you some mail; what's your ppn?" Usage: not used at MIT, since ITS does not
use ppn's. The equivalent terms would be UNAME and SNAME, depending on
context, but these are not used except in their technical senses.
