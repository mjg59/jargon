 PPN: /pip'n/ [from `Project-Programmer Number'] n. A user-ID under {TOPS-10}
and its various mutant progeny at SAIL, BBN, CompuServe, and elsewhere.
Old-time hackers from the PDP-10 era sometimes use this to refer to user IDs
on other systems as well. precedence lossage: /pre's@-dens los'j/ [C
programmers] n. Coding error in an expression due to unexpected grouping of
arithmetic or logical operators by the compiler. Used esp. of certain common
coding errors in C due to the nonintuitively low precedence levels of `&',
`|', `^', `<<', `>>'. Can always be avoided by suitable use of parentheses.
see {aliasing bug}, {memory leak}, {smash the stack}, {fandango on core},
{overrun screw}. prepend: /pree`pend'/ [by analogy with `append'] vt. To
prefix. Like `append', but unlike `prefix' or `suffix' as a verb, the direct
object is always the thing being added and not the original word (character
string, etc). No, this is *not* standard English, yet! pretty pictures: n.
[scientific computation] The next step up from {numbers}. Interesting
graphical output from a program which may not have any real relationship to
the reality the program is intended to model. Good for showing to
{management}. prettyprint: /prit'ee-print/ v. 1. To generate `pretty'
human-readable output from a {hairy} internal representation; esp. used for
the process of {grind}ing (sense #2) LISP code. 2. To format in some
particularly slick and nontrivial way. prime time: [from TV programming] n.
Normal high-usage hours on a timesharing system; the day shift. Avoidance of
prime time is a major reason for {night mode} hacking. priority interrupt:
[from the hardware term] n. Describes any stimulus compelling enough to yank
one right out of {hack mode}. Classically used to describe being dragged away
by an {SO} for immediate sex, but may also refer to more mundane
interruptions such as a fire alarm going off in the near vicinity. Also
called an NMI (non-maskable interrupt), especially in PC-land. profile:
[UNIX] n. 1. A control file for a program, esp. a text file automatically
read from each user's home directory and intended to be easily modified by
the user. Used to avoid {hardcoded} choices. 2. A report on the amounts of
time spent in each routine of a program, used to find and {tune} away the
{hot spot}s in it. This sense is often verbed. Some profiling modes report
units other than time (such as call counts) at granularities other than
per-routine, but the idea is similar. program: 1. n. A magic spell cast over
a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error messages. 2. n. An
exercise in experimental epistemology. 3. vt. To engage in a pastime similar
to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for
reward. Programmer's Cheer: "Shift to the left! Shift to the right! Pop up,
push down! Byte! Byte! Byte!" A joke so old it has hair on it....
programming: n. In folklore, this was classically defined as "The art of
debugging a blank sheet of paper". Following the rise of on-line editing this
should probably be recast as "The art of debugging an empty source file".
propeller head: n. Used by hackers, this is syn. with {computer geek}.
Non-hackers sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob. derives from SF
fandom's tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray Faraday Nelson)
of propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody actually wears them
except as a joke). proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior;
implies a product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of
their employer's hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of
hackers and users, inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems
standards, and thus one which puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able
to gouge freely on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has
locked the customer in (that's assuming it wasn't too expensive in the first
place). protocol: n. As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about
the proper form for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in
which one should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers
don't care about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules
which allow different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each
other without ambiguity; for example, it does include the niceties of
addressing packets on a network or the order in which one should use the
forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It implies that there's some common
message format and accepted set of primitives or commands that all parties
involved understand, and that transactions among them follow predictable
logical sequences. see also {handshaking}, {do protocol}. prowler: [UNIX] n.
A {demon} that is run periodically (typically once a week) to seek out and
erase core files (see {core}), truncate administrative logfiles, nuke
lost+found directories, and otherwise clean up the {cruft} that tends to pile
up in the corners of a file system. see also {GFR}, {reaper}, {skulker}.
pseudo: /soo'doh/ [USENET] n. 1. An electronic-mail or {USENET} persona
adopted by a human for amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative
repercussions of his/her net.behavior; a `nom de USENET', often associated
with forged postings designed to conceal message origins. Perhaps the
best-known and funniest hoax of this type is {BIFF}. 2. Notionally, a
{flamage}-generating AI program simulating a USENET user. Many flamers have
been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI
program of the required sophistication exists. However, in 1989 there was a
famous series of forged postings that used a phrase-frequency-based travesty
generator to simulate the styles of several well-known flamers based on large
samples of their back postings. A significant number of people were fooled by
these, and the debate over their authenticity was only settled when the
perpetrator of the hoax came publicly forward to admit the deed. pseudoprime:
n. A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with one point
missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from a mathematical method
which, rather than determining precisely whether a number is prime (has no
divisors), uses a statistical technique to decide whether the number is
"probably" prime. A number that passes this test is called a pseudoprime. The
hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as
good as a prime: it does the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that
probably won't happen. pseudosuit: n. A {suit} wannabee; a hacker who's
decided that he wants to be in management or administration and begins
wearing ties, sport coats, and (shudder!) suits voluntarily. His funeral....
psychedelicware: /sie`k@-del'-ik-weir/ [Great Britain] n. Syn. {display
hack}. see also {smoking clover}. pubic directory: [NYU] n. The `pub'
(public) directory on a machine that allows {FTP} access; the top-level
directory owned by ftp. So called because it is the default location for
{SEX} (sense #1). puff: vt. To decompress data that has been crunched by
Huffman coding. At least one widely distributed Huffman decoder program was
actually *named* `PUFF', but these days it isn't usually separate from the
encoder. Oppose {huff}. punched card:: alt. `punch card' 1. n.obs. The
signature medium of computing's {Stone Age}, now obsolescent outside of some
IBM shops. The punched card actually predated computers considerably,
originating as a control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by
Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S.
Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm, designed to fit
exactly in the currency trays used for that era's larger dollar bills. IBM
(which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the punched
card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of small
rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card. Later,
other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shape were tried. The 80-column
width of most character terminals is a legacy of the punched card; so is the
size of the quick reference cards distributed with many varieties of
computers even today. see {chad}, {chad box}, {eighty-column mind}, {green
card}, {dusty deck}, {lace card}. punt: [from the punch line of an old joke
referring to American football: "Drop back 15 yards and punt"] vt. 1. To give
up, typically without any intention of retrying. "Let's punt the movie
tonight." "I was going to hack all night to get this feature in, but I
decided to punt" may mean that you've decided not to stay up all night, and
may also mean you're not ever even going to put in the feature. 2. More
specifically, to give up on figuring out what the {Right Thing} is and resort
to an inefficient hack. Purple Book: n. The `System V Interface Definition'.
The covers of the first editions were an amazingly nauseating shade of
off-lavender. see also {Red Book}, {Blue Book}, {Green Book}, {Silver Book},
{Orange Book}, {White Book}, {Pink-Shirt Book}, {Dragon Book}, {Aluminum
Book}. push: [based on the stack operation that puts the current information
on a stack, and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on the
stack] Also PUSH or PUSHJ /push-jay/, based on the PDP-10 procedure call
instruction. 1. To put something onto a {stack} or {pdl}. If a person says
something has been pushed onto his stack, he means yet another thing has been
added to the list of things hanging over his head for him to do. This may
also imply that he will deal with it `before' other pending items; otherwise
he might have said the thing was "added to his queue". 2. vi. To enter upon a
digression, to save the current discussion for later. Antonym of {pop}; see
also {stack}, {pdl}. = Q = ===== quad: n. 1. Two bits; syn. for {quarter},
{crumb}, {tayste}. 2. The rectangle or box glyph used in the APL language for
various arcane purposes mostly related to I/O. Ex-Ivy-Leaguers and Oxbridge
types are said to associate it with nostalgic memories of dear old
University. quadruple bucky: n., obs. 1. On an MIT {space-cadet keyboard},
use of all four of the shifting keys control, meta, hyper, and super while
typing a character key. 2. On a Stanford or MIT keyboard in raw mode, use of
four shift keys while typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are
the control and meta keys on *both* sides of the keyboard. This was very
difficult to do! One accepted technique was to press the left-control and
left-meta keys with your left hand, the right-control and right-meta keys
with your right hand, and the fifth key with your nose. Quadruple-bucky
combinations were very seldom used in practice, because when one invented a
new command one usually assigned it to some character that was easier to
type. If you want to imply that a program has ridiculously many commands or
features, you can say something like "Oh, the command that makes it spin the
tapes while whistling Beethoven's 5th Symphony is
quadruple-bucky-cokebottle". see {double bucky}, {bucky bits}, {cokebottle}.
quantum bogodynamics: /kwon'tm boh`goh-die-nam'iks/ n. Theory which
characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such as politicians,
used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and {suit}s in general), bogon sinks (such
as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields. Bogon absorption,
of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and
may cause them to emit secondary bogons as well); however, the precise
mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood and
remain to be elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is most frequently invoked to
explain the sharp increase in hardware and software failures in the presence
of suits; the latter emit bogons which the former absorb. see {bogon},
{computron}, {suit}. quarter: n. Two bits; syn. {tayste}, {crumb}, {quad}.
The term comes from the `pieces of eight' famed in pirate movies --- Spanish
gold pieces that could be broken into eight pie-slice-shaped `bits' to make
change. Early in the U.S.'s history the coin was considered equal to a
dollar, so each of these `bits' was considered worth 12.5 cents. Usage: rare.
see also {nickle}, {nybble}, {{byte}}. ques: /kwess/ 1. n. The question mark
character (`?', ASCII 0111111). 2. interj. What? Also frequently verb-doubled
as "Ques ques?" see {wall}. quick and dirty: adj. Describes a {crock} put
together under time or user pressure. Used esp. when you want to convey that
you think the fast way might lead to trouble further down the road. "I can
have a quick and dirty fix in place tonight, but I'll have to rewrite the
whole module to solve the underlying design problem." see also {kluge}. quux:
/kwuhks/ [invented by Steele] Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb
quuxo, quuxare, quuxandum iri; noun form variously `quux' (plural `quuces',
anglicized to `quuxes') and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four
u-letters out of seven total, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble in one
swell foop).] 1. Originally, a meta-word like {foo} and {foobar}. Invented by
Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was young and naive and not yet
interacting with the real computing community. Many people invent such words;
this one seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little. In
an eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the originator in
the form of a nickname, as punishment for inventing the bletcherous word in
the first place. 2. interj. see {foo}; however, denotes very little disgust,
and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. Guy Steele in his
persona as `The Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light verse and
for the `Crunchly' cartoons. 4. In some circles, quux is used as a punning
opposite of `crux'. "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" implies that the
point is *not* crucial (compare {tip of the iceberg}). 5. quuxy: adj. Of or
pertaining to a quux. qux: /kwuhks/ The fourth of the standard metasyntactic
variables, after {baz} and before the quuu*x series. see {foo}, {bar}, {baz},
{quux}. Note that this appears to be a recent mutation from {quux}, and that
many versions of the standard series just run {foo}, {bar}, {baz}, {quux},
