 PPN: /P-P-N/, /pip'n/ [from `Project-Programmer Number'] n. A user-ID under
{{TOPS-10}} and its various mutant progeny at SAIL, BBN, CompuServe, and
elsewhere. Old-time hackers from the PDP-10 era sometimes use this to refer
to user IDs on other systems as well. precedence lossage: /pre's*-dens
los'*j/ [C programmers] n. Coding error in an expression due to unexpected
grouping of arithmetic or logical operators by the compiler. Used esp. of
certain common coding errors in C due to the nonintuitively low precedence
levels of `&', `|', `^', `<<', and `>>' (for this reason, experienced C
programmers deliberately forget the language's {baroque} precedence hierarchy
and parenthesize defensively). Can always be avoided by suitable use of
parentheses. {LISP} fans enjoy pointing out that this can't happen in *their*
favorite language, which eschews precedence entirely, requiring one to use
explicit parentheses everywhere. see {aliasing bug}, {memory leak}, {smash
the stack}, {fandango on core}, {overrun screw}. prepend: /pree`pend'/ [by
analogy with `append'] vt. To prefix. As with `append' (but not `prefix' or
`suffix' as a verb), the direct object is always the thing being added and
not the original word (or character string, or whatever). "If you prepend a
semicolon to the line, the translation routine will pass it through
unaltered." prestidigitization: /pres`t*-di`j*-ti:-zay'sh*n/ n. 1. The act of
putting something into digital notation via sleight of hand. 2. Data entry
through legerdemain. pretty pictures: n. [scientific computation] The next
step up from {numbers}. Interesting graphical output from a program that may
not have any sensible relationship to the system the program is intended to
model. Good for showing to {management}. prettyprint: /prit'ee-print/ (alt.
`pretty-print') v. 1. To generate `pretty' human-readable output from a
{hairy} internal representation; esp. used for the process of {grind}ing
(sense 2) LISP code. 2. To format in some particularly slick and nontrivial
way. pretzel key: [Mac users] n. see {command key}. prime time: [from TV
programming] n. Normal high-usage hours on a timesharing system; the day
shift. Avoidance of prime time is a major reason for {night mode} hacking.
priority interrupt: [from the hardware term] n. Describes any stimulus
compelling enough to yank one right out of {hack mode}. Classically used to
describe being dragged away by an {SO} for immediate sex, but may also refer
to more mundane interruptions such as a fire alarm going off in the near
vicinity. Also called an {NMI} (non-maskable interrupt), especially in
PC-land. profile: n. 1. A control file for a program, esp. a text file
automatically read from each user's home directory and intended to be easily
modified by the user in order to customize the program's behavior. Used to
avoid {hardcoded} choices. 2. [techspeak] A report on the amounts of time
spent in each routine of a program, used to find and {tune} away the {hot
spot}s in it. This sense is often verbed. Some profiling modes report units
other than time (such as call counts) and/or report at granularities other
than per-routine, but the idea is similar. proglet: /prog'let/ [UK] n. A
short extempore program written to meet an immediate, transient need. Often
written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen lines long, and contains no
subroutines. The largest amount of code that can be written off the top of
one's head, that does not need any editing, and that runs correctly the first
time (this amount varies significantly according to the language one is
using). Compare {toy program}, {noddy}, {one-liner wars}. program: n. 1. A
magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error
messages. 2. An exercise in experimental epistemology. 3. A form of art,
ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers, which is nevertheless
almost inevitably a failure if other programmers can't understand it.
Programmer's Cheer: "Shift to the left! Shift to the right! Pop up, push
down! Byte! Byte! Byte!" A joke so old it has hair on it. programming: n. 1.
The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper (or, in these days of on-line
editing, the art of debugging an empty file). 2. n. A pastime similar to
banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for reward.
3. n. The most fun you can have with your clothes on (although clothes are
not mandatory). propeller head: n. Used by hackers, this is syn. with
{computer geek}. Non-hackers sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob.
derives from SF fandom's tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray
Faraday Nelson) of propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody
actually wears them except as a joke). propeller key: [Mac users] n. see
{command key}. proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies
a product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the
company's hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and
users, inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards,
and thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge
freely on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the
customer in (that's assuming it wasn't too expensive in the first place).
protocol: n. As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the
proper form for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which
one should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care
about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules that allow
different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each other
without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties about the proper
form for addressing packets on a network or the order in which one should use
the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It implies that there is some
common message format and an accepted set of primitives or commands that all
parties involved understand, and that transactions among them follow
predictable logical sequences. see also {handshaking}, {do protocol}.
provocative maintenance: [common ironic mutation of `preventive maintenance']
n. Actions performed upon a machine at regularly scheduled intervals to
ensure that the system remains in a usable state. So called because it is all
too often performed by a {field servoid} who doesn't know what he is doing;
this results in the machine's remaining in an *un*usable state for an
indeterminate amount of time. see also {scratch monkey}. prowler: [UNIX] n. A
{daemon} that is run periodically (typically once a week) to seek out and
erase {core} files, truncate administrative logfiles, nuke `lost+found'
directories, and otherwise clean up the {cruft} that tends to pile up in the
corners of a file system. see also {GFR}, {reaper}, {skulker}. pseudo:
/soo'doh/ [USENET: truncation of `pseudonym'] n. 1. An electronic-mail or
{USENET} persona adopted by a human for amusement value or as a means of
avoiding negative repercussions of one's net.behavior; a `nom de USENET',
often associated with forged postings designed to conceal message origins.
Perhaps the best-known and funniest hoax of this type is {BIFF}. 2.
Notionally, a {flamage}-generating AI program simulating a USENET user. Many
flamers have been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact
that no AI program of the required sophistication yet exists. However, in
1989 there was a famous series of forged postings that used a
phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of several
well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their back postings
(compare {Dissociated Press}). A significant number of people were fooled by
the forgeries, and the debate over their authenticity was settled only when
the perpetrator came forward to publicly admit the hoax. pseudoprime: n. A
backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with one point missing.
This term is an esoteric pun derived from a mathematical method that, rather
than determining precisely whether a number is prime (has no divisors), uses
a statistical technique to decide whether the number is `probably' prime. A
number that passes this test is called a pseudoprime. The hacker backgammon
usage stems from the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it
does the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that probably won't
happen. pseudosuit: /soo'doh-s[y]oot`/ n. A {suit} wannabee; a hacker who has
decided that he wants to be in management or administration and begins
wearing ties, sport coats, and (shudder!) suits voluntarily. It's his
funeral. see also {lobotomy}. psychedelicware: /si:`k*-del'-ik-weir/ [UK] n.
Syn. {display hack}. see also {smoking clover}. psyton: /si:'ton/ [TMRC] n.
The elementary particle carrying the sinister force. The probability of a
process losing is proportional to the number of psytons falling on it.
Psytons are generated by observers, which is why demos are more likely to
fail when lots of people are watching. [This term appears to have been
largely superseded by {bogon}; see also {quantum bogodynamics}. --- ESR]
pubic directory: [NYU] (also `pube directory' /pyoob' d*-rek't*-ree/) n. The
`pub' (public) directory on a machine that allows {FTP} access. So called
because it is the default location for {SEX} (sense 1). "I'll have the source
in the pube directory by Friday." puff: vt. To decompress data that has been
crunched by Huffman coding. At least one widely distributed Huffman decoder
program was actually *named* `PUFF', but these days it is usually packaged
with the encoder. Oppose {huff}. punched card:: alt. `punch card' [techspeak]
n.obs. The signature medium of computing's {Stone Age}, now obsolescent
outside of some IBM shops. The punched card actually predated computers
considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for mechanical looms.
The version patented by Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating
machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215
mm, designed to fit exactly in the currency trays used for that era's larger
dollar bills. IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer)
married the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as
patterns of small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per
card. Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times. The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of
the IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
with many varieties of computers even today. see {chad}, {chad box},
{eighty-column mind}, {green card}, {dusty deck}, {lace card}, {card
walloper}. punt: [from the punch line of an old joke referring to American
football: "Drop back 15 yards and punt!"] v. 1. To give up, typically without
any intention of retrying. "Let's punt the movie tonight." "I was going to
hack all night to get this feature in, but I decided to punt" may mean that
you've decided not to stay up all night, and may also mean you're not ever
even going to put in the feature. 2. More specifically, to give up on
figuring out what the {Right Thing} is and resort to an inefficient hack. 3.
A design decision to defer solving a problem, typically because one cannot
define what is desirable sufficiently well to frame an algorithmic solution.
"No way to know what the right form to dump the graph in is --- we'll punt
that for now." 4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other
section of the design. "It's too hard to get the compiler to do that; let's
punt to the runtime system." Purple Book: n. The `System V Interface
Definition'. The covers of the first editions were an amazingly nauseating
shade of off-lavender. see also {{book titles}}. push: [from the operation
that puts the current information on a stack, and the fact that procedure
return addresses are saved on a stack] Also PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/
(the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure call instruction). 1. To put
something onto a {stack} or {pdl}. If one says that something has been pushed
onto one's stack, it means that the Damoclean list of things hanging over
ones's head has grown longer and heavier yet. This may also imply that one
will deal with it *before* other pending items; otherwise one might say that
the thing was `added to my queue'. 2. vi. To enter upon a digression, to save
the current discussion for later. Antonym of {pop}; see also {stack}, {pdl}.
= Q = ===== quad: n. 1. Two bits; syn. for {quarter}, {crumb}, {tayste}. 2. A
four-pack of anything (compare {hex}, sense 2). 3. The rectangle or box glyph
used in the APL language for various arcane purposes mostly related to I/O.
Former Ivy-Leaguers and Oxbridge types are said to associate it with
nostalgic memories of dear old University. quadruple bucky: n., obs. 1. On an
MIT {space-cadet keyboard}, use of all four of the shifting keys (control,
meta, hyper, and super) while typing a character key. 2. On a Stanford or MIT
keyboard in {raw mode}, use of four shift keys while typing a fifth
character, where the four shift keys are the control and meta keys on *both*
sides of the keyboard. This was very difficult to do! One accepted technique
was to press the left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the fifth key
with your nose. Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in
practice, because when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to
some character that was easier to type. If you want to imply that a program
has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say something like: "Oh,
the command that makes it spin the tapes while whistling Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony is quadruple-bucky-cokebottle." see {double bucky}, {bucky bits},
{cokebottle}. quantifiers:: In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric
prefixes used in the SI (Syst`eme International) conventions for scientific
measurement have dual uses. With units of time or things that come in powers
of 10, such as money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by
powers of 1000 = 10^3. But when used with bytes or other things that
naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers
of 1024 = 2^{10}. Here are the magnifying prefixes in jargon use: prefix
decimal binary kilo- 1000^1 1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 mega- 1000^2 1024^2 = 2^20
= 1,048,576 giga- 1000^3 1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 tera- 1000^4 1024^4 =
2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 peta- 1000^5 1024^5 = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624
exa- 1000^6 1024^6 = 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 Here are the fractional
prefixes: *prefix decimal jargon usage* milli- 1000^-1 (seldom used in
jargon) micro- 1000^-2 small or human-scale (see {micro-}) nano- 1000^-3 even
smaller (see {nano-}) pico- 1000^-4 even smaller yet (see {pico-}) femto-
1000^-5 (not used in jargon---yet) atto- 1000^-6 (not used in jargon---yet)
The binary peta- and exa- loadings are not in common use---yet, and the
prefix milli-, denoting multiplication by 1000^{-1}, has always been rare
(there is, however, a standard joke about the `millihelen' --- notionally,
the amount of beauty required to launch one ship). see the entries on
{micro-}, {pico-}, and {nano-} for more information on connotative jargon use
of these terms. `Femto' and `atto' (which, interestingly, derive not from
Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings, though it is
easy to predict what those will be once computing technology enters the
required realms of magnitude (however, see {attoparsec}). There are, of
course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10. In the following table,
the `prefix' column is the international standard suffix for the appropriate
power of ten; the `binary' column lists jargon abbreviations and words for
the corresponding power of 2. The B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte
quantities; the words `meg' and `gig' are nouns which may (but do not always)
pluralize with `s'. prefix decimal binary pronunciation kilo- k K, KB, /kay/
mega- M M, MB, meg /meg/ giga- G G, GB, gig /gig/,/jig/ Confusingly, hackers
often use K as though it were a suffix or numeric multiplier rather than a
prefix; thus "2K dollars". This is also true (though less commonly) of G and
M. Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use this
strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB is `kilobytes'). K, M,
and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64 gigabytes and
`a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of `a G' as short for `a grand',
that is, $1000). Whether one pronounces `gig' with hard or soft `g' depends
on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of `giga-' is. Confusing 1000 and
1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in magnitude) --- for example,
describing a memory in units of 500K or 524K instead of 512K --- is a sure
sign of the {marketroid}. quantum bogodynamics: /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/
n. A theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such
as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and {suit}s in general),
bogon sinks (such as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields.
Bogon absorption, of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and
machines to fail (and may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however,
the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet
understood and remain to be elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is most often
invoked to explain the sharp increase in hardware and software failures in
the presence of suits; the latter emit bogons, which the former absorb. see
{bogon}, {computron}, {suit}, {psyton}. quarter: n. Two bits. This in turn
comes from the `pieces of eight' famed in pirate movies --- Spanish gold
pieces that could be broken into eight pie-slice-shaped `bits' to make
change. Early in American history the Spanish coin was considered equal to a
dollar, so each of these `bits' was considered worth 12.5 cents. Syn.
{tayste}, {crumb}, {quad}. Usage: rare. see also {nickle}, {nybble},
{{byte}}, {dynner}. ques: /kwes/ 1. n. The question mark character (`?',
ASCII 0111111). 2. interj. What? Also frequently verb-doubled as "Ques ques?"
see {wall}. quick-and-dirty: adj. Describes a {crock} put together under time
or user pressure. Used esp. when you want to convey that you think the fast
way might lead to trouble further down the road. "I can have a
quick-and-dirty fix in place tonight, but I'll have to rewrite the whole
module to solve the underlying design problem." see also {kluge}. quote
chapter and verse: [by analogy with the mainstream phrase] v. To reproduce a
relevant excerpt from an appropriate {bible}. "I don't care if `rn' gets it
wrong; `Followup-To: poster' is explicitly permitted by RFC-1036. I'll quote
chapter and verse if you don't believe me." quotient: n. see {coefficient}.
quux: /kwuhks/ Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb quuxo, quuxare,
quuxandum iri; noun form variously `quux' (plural `quuces', anglicized to
`quuxes') and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four u-letters out
of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble).] 1. Originally, a
metasyntactic variable like {foo} and {foobar}. Invented by Guy Steele for
precisely this purpose when he was young and na"ive and not yet interacting
with the real computing community. Many people invent such words; this one
seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little. In an
eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the originator in the
form of a nickname. 2. interj. see {foo}; however, denotes very little
disgust, and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. Guy Steele
in his persona as `The Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light
verse and for the `Crunchly' cartoons. 4. In some circles, quux is used as a
punning opposite of `crux'. "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" implies that
the point is *not* crucial (compare {tip of the ice-cube}). 5. quuxy: adj. Of
or pertaining to a quux. qux: /kwuhks/ The fourth of the standard
metasyntactic variables, after {baz} and before the quu(u...)x series. see
{foo}, {bar}, {baz}, {quux}. This appears to be a recent mutation from
{quux}, and many versions of the standard series just run {foo}, {bar},
{baz}, {quux}, ....
