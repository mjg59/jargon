 :little-endian: adj. Describes a computer architecture in which, within a
given 16- or 32-bit word, bytes at lower addresses have lower significance
(the word is stored `little-end-first'). The {PDP-11} and {VAX} families of
computers and Intel microprocessors and a lot of communications and
networking hardware are little-endian. see {big-endian}, {middle-endian},
{NUXI problem}. The term is sometimes used to describe the ordering of units
other than bytes; most often, bits within a byte.
