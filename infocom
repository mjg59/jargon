 :Infocom: n. A now-legendary games company, active from 1979 to 1989, that
commercialized the MDL parser technology used for {Zork} to produce a line of
text adventure games that remain favorites among hackers. Infocom's games
were intelligent, funny, witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical,
and most thoroughly hackish in spirit. The physical game packages from
Infocom are now prized collector's items. The software, thankfully, is still
extant; Infocom games were written in a kind of P-code and distributed with a
P-code interpreter core, and freeware emulators for that interpreter have
been written to permit the P-code to be run on platforms the games never
originally graced.
