 :Infocom: n. A now-legendary games company, active from 1979 to 1989, that
commercialized the MDL parser technology used for {Zork} to produce a line of
text adventure games that remain favorites among hackers. Infocom's games
were intelligent, funny, witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical,
and most thoroughly hackish in spirit. The physical game packages from
Infocom are now prized collector's items. After being acquired by Activision
in 1989 they did a few more "modern" (e.g. graphics-intensive) games which
were less successful than reissues of their classics. The software,
thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were written in a kind of P-code
and distributed with a P-code interpreter core, and not only open-source
emulators for that interpreter but an actual compiler as well have been
written to permit the P-code to be run on platforms the games never
originally graced. In fact, new games written in this P-code are still being
written. There is a home page at `http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/', and it is
even possible to play these games in your browser
(http://www.xs4all.nl/~pot/infocom/) if it is Java-capable.
