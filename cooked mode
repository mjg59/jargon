 :cooked mode: [UNIX] n. The normal character-input mode, with interrupts
enabled and with erase, kill and other special-character interpretations done
directly by the tty driver. Oppose {raw mode}, {rare mode}. This is techspeak
under UNIX but jargon elsewhere; other operating systems often have similar
mode distinctions, and the raw/rare/cooked way of describing them has spread
widely along with the C language and other UNIX exports. Most generally,
`cooked mode' may refer to any mode of a system that does extensive
preprocessing before presenting data to a program.
