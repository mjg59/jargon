 BUSY-WAIT v. To wait on an event by SPINning through a tight or timed-delay
loop that polls for the event on each pass, as opposed to setting up an
interrupt handler and continuing execution on another part of the task. A
wasteful technique, best avoided on time-sharing systems where a busy-waiting
program may hog the processor.
