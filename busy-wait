 :busy-wait: vi. Used of human behavior, conveys that the subject is busy
waiting for someone or something, intends to move instantly as soon as it
shows up, and thus cannot do anything else at the moment. "Can't talk now,
I'm busy-waiting till Bill gets off the phone." Technically, `busy-wait'
means to wait on an event by {spin}ning through a tight or timed-delay loop
that polls for the event on each pass, as opposed to setting up an interrupt
handler and continuing execution on another part of the task. In applications
this is a wasteful technique, and best avoided on time-sharing systems where
a busy-waiting program may {hog} the processor. However, it is often
unavoidable in kernel programming. In the Linux world, kernel busy-waits are
usually referred to as `spinlocks'.
