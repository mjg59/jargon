 :hakspek: /hak'speek/ /n./ A shorthand method of spelling found on many
British academic bulletin boards and {talker system}s. Syllables and whole
words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names of
which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are
usually dropped. Hence, `for' becomes `4'; `two', `too', and `to' become `2';
`ck' becomes `k'. "Before I see you tomorrow" becomes "b4 i c u 2moro". First
appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by the slowness of
available talker systems, which operated on archaic machines with outdated
operating systems and no standard methods of communication. Has become rarer
since. see also {talk mode}.
