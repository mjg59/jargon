 :hakspek: /hak'speek/ n. A shorthand method of spelling found on many
British academic bulletin boards and {talker system}s. Syllables and whole
words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names of
which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are
usually dropped. Hence, `for' becomes `4'; `two', `too', and `to' become `2';
`ck' becomes `k'. "Before I see you tomorrow" becomes "b4 i c u 2moro". First
appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by the slowness of
available talker systems, which operated on archaic machines with outdated
operating systems and no standard methods of communication. Hakspek almost
diappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of the early 1990s, as fast
Internet links wiped out the old-style talker systems. However, it has
enjoyed a revival in another medium - the Short Message Service (SMS)
associated with GSM cellphones. SMS sends are limited to a maximum of 160
characters, and typing on a cellphone keypad is difficult and slow anyway.
There are now even published paper dictionaries for SMS users to help them do
hakspek-to-English and vice-versa. see also {talk mode}.
