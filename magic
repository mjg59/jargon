 :magic: adj. 1. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to explain; compare
{automagically} and (Arthur C.) Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." "TTY echoing is
controlled by a large number of magic bits." "This routine magically computes
the parity of an 8-bit byte in three instructions." 2. Characteristic of
something that works although no one really understands why (this is
especially called {black magic}). 3. [Stanford] A feature not generally
publicized that allows something otherwise impossible, or a feature formerly
in that category but now unveiled. Compare {black magic}, {wizardly}, {deep
magic}, {heavy wizardry}. For more about hackish `magic', see {A Story About
`Magic'} (in {appendix A}).
