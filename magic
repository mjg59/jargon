AUTOMAGICALLY and Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic"). "TTY echoing is controlled by a large
number of magic bits." "This routine magically computes the parity of an
eight-bit byte in three instructions." 2. Characteristic of something that
works but no one really understands why. 3. [Stanford] A feature not
generally publicized which allows something otherwise impossible, or a
feature formerly in that category but now unveiled. Example: The keyboard
commands which override the screen-hiding features.
