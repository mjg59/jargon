 :magic: 1. adj. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to explain; compare
{automagically} and (Arthur C.) Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." "TTY echoing is
controlled by a large number of magic bits." "This routine magically computes
the parity of an 8-bit byte in three instructions." 2. adj. Characteristic of
something that works although no one really understands why (this is
especially called {black magic}). 3. n. [Stanford] A feature not generally
publicized that allows something otherwise impossible, or a feature formerly
in that category but now unveiled. 4. n. The ultimate goal of all engineering
& development, elegance in the extreme; from the first corollary to Clarke's
Third Law: "Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently
advanced". Parodies playing on these senses of the term abound; some have
made their way into serious documentation, as when a MAGIC directive was
described in the Control Card Reference for GCOS c.1978. For more about
hackish `magic', see Appendix A. Compare {black magic}, {wizardly}, {deep
magic}, {heavy wizardry}.
