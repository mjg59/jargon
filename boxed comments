 :boxed comments: /n./ Comments (explanatory notes attached to program
instructions) that occupy several lines by themselves; so called because in
assembler and C code they are often surrounded by a box in a style something
like this: /************************************************* * * This is a
boxed comment in C style * *************************************************/
Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column 2 or add a
matching row of asterisks closing the right side of the box. The sparest
variant omits all but the comment delimiters themselves; the `box' is
implied. Oppose {winged comments}.
