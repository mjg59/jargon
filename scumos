 :ScumOS: /skuhm'os/ or /skuhm'O-S/ n. Unflattering hackerism for SunOS, the
BSD Unix variant supported on Sun Microsystems's Unix workstations (see also
{sun-stools}), and compare {AIDX}, {Macintrash}, {Nominal Semidestructor},
{HP-SUX}. Despite what this term might suggest, Sun was founded by hackers
and still enjoys excellent relations with hackerdom; usage is more often in
exasperation than outright loathing.
