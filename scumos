 :ScumOS: /skuhm'os/ or /skuhm'O-S/ n. Unflattering hackerism for SunOS, the
UNIX variant supported on Sun Microsystems's UNIX workstations (see also
{sun-stools}), and compare {AIDX}, {terminak}, {Macintrash} {Nominal
Semidestructor}, {Open DeathTrap}, {HP-SUX}. Despite what this term might
suggest, Sun was founded by hackers and still enjoys excellent relations with
hackerdom; usage is more often in exasperation than outright loathing.
