 :NIL: /nil/ No. Used in reply to a question, particularly one asked using
the `-P' convention. Most hackers assume this derives simply from LISP
terminology for `false' (see also {T}), but NIL as a negative reply was
well-established among radio hams decades before the advent of LISP. The
historical connection between early hackerdom and the ham radio world was
strong enough that this may have been an influence.
