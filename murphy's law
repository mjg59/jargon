 :Murphy's Law: /prov./ The correct, *original* Murphy's Law reads: "If there
are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can result in a
catastrophe, then someone will do it." This is a principle of defensive
design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms less
descriptive of the challenges of design for {luser}s. For example, you don't
make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if it
matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical
(see also the anecdote under {magic smoke}). Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of
the engineers on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air
Force in 1949 to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981). One
experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of
the subject's body. There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its
mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around.
Murphy then made the original form of his pronouncement, which the test
subject (Major John Paul Stapp) quoted at a news conference a few days later.
Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went. Most
of these are variants on "Anything that can go wrong, will"; this is
correctly referred to as {Finagle's Law}. The memetic drift apparent in these
mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!
