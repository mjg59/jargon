 :field circus: [a derogatory pun on `field service'] n. The field service
organization of any hardware manufacturer, but especially DEC. There is an
entire genre of jokes about DEC field circus engineers: Q: How can you
recognize a DEC field circus engineer with a flat tire? A: He's changing one
tire at a time to see which one is flat. Q: How can you recognize a DEC field
circus engineer who is out of gas? A: He's changing one tire at a time to see
which one is flat. [see {Easter egging} for additional insight on these
jokes.] There is also the `Field Circus Cheer' (from the {plan file} for DEC
on MIT-AI): Maynard! Maynard! Don't mess with us! We're mean and we're tough!
If you get us confused We'll screw up your stuff. (DEC's service HQ is
located in Maynard, Massachusetts.)
