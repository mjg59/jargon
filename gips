 GIPS: /gips/ or /jips/ [analogy with {MIPS}] n. Giga-Instructions per Second
(also possibly `Gillions of Instructions per Second'; see {gillion}). In
1991, this is used of only a handful of highly parallel machines, but this is
expected to change. Compare {KIPS}. glark: /glark/ vt. To figure something
out from context. "The System III manuals are pretty poor, but you can
generally glark the meaning from context." Interestingly, the word was
originally `glork'; the context was "This gubblick contains many nonsklarkish
English flutzpahs, but the overall pluggandisp can be glorked [sic] from
context" (David Moser, quoted by Douglas Hofstadter in his "Metamagical
Themas" column in the January 1981 `Scientific American'). It is conjectured
that hackish usage mutated the verb to `glark' because {glork} was already an
established jargon term. Compare {grok}, {zen}. glass: [IBM] n. Synonym for
{silicon}. glass tty: /glas T-T-Y/ or /glas ti'tee/ n. A terminal that has a
display screen but which, because of hardware or software limitations,
behaves like a teletype or some other printing terminal, thereby combining
the disadvantages of both: like a printing terminal, it can't do fancy
display hacks, and like a display terminal, it doesn't produce hard copy. An
example is the early `dumb' version of Lear-Siegler ADM 3 (without cursor
control). see {tube}, {tty}. See appendix A for an interesting true story
about a glass tty. glassfet: /glas'fet/ [by analogy with MOSFET, the acronym
for `Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor'] n. Syn.
{firebottle}, a humorous way to refer to a vacuum tube. glitch: /glich/ [from
German `glitschen' to slip, via Yiddish `glitshen', to slide or skid] 1. n. A
sudden interruption in electric service, sanity, continuity, or program
function. Sometimes recoverable. An interruption in electric service is
specifically called a `power glitch'. This is of grave concern because it
usually crashes all the computers. In jargon, though, a hacker who got to the
middle of a sentence and then forgot how he or she intended to complete it
might say, "Sorry, I just glitched". 2. vi. To commit a glitch. see {gritch}.
3. vt. [Stanford] To scroll a display screen, esp. several lines at a time.
{{WAITS}} terminals used to do this in order to avoid continuous scrolling,
which is distracting to the eye. 4. obs. Same as {magic cookie}, sense 2. All
these uses of `glitch' derive from the specific technical meaning the term
has to hardware people. If the inputs of a circuit change, and the outputs
change to some {random} value for some very brief time before they settle
down to the correct value, then that is called a glitch. This may or may not
be harmful, depending on what the circuit is connected to. This term is
techspeak, found in electronics texts. glob: /glob/, *not* /glohb/ [UNIX]
vt.,n. To expand special characters in a wildcarded name, or the act of so
doing (the action is also called `globbing'). The UNIX conventions for
filename wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use
some of them in written English, especially in email or news on technical
topics. Those commonly encountered include the following: * wildcard for any
string (see also {UN*X}) ? wildcard for any character (generally read this
way only at the beginning or in the middle of a word) [] delimits a wildcard
matching any of the enclosed characters {} alternation of comma-separated
alternatives; thus, `foo{baz,qux}' would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux' Some
examples: "He said his name was [KC]arl" (expresses ambiguity). "I don't read
talk.politics.*" (any of the talk.politics subgroups on {USENET}). Other
examples are given under the entry for {X}. Compare {regexp}. Historical
note: The jargon usage derives from `glob', the name of a subprogram that
expanded wildcards in archaic pre-Bourne versions of the UNIX shell. glork:
/glork/ 1. interj. Term of mild surprise, usually tinged with outrage, as
when one attempts to save the results of 2 hours of editing and finds that
the system has just crashed. 2. Used as a name for just about anything. see
{foo}. 3. vt. Similar to {glitch}, but usually used reflexively. "My program
just glorked itself." see also {glark}. glue: n. Generic term for any
interface logic or protocol that connects two component blocks. For example,
{Blue Glue} is IBM's SNA protocol, and hardware designers call anything used
to connect large VLSI's or circuit blocks `glue logic'. gnarly: /nar'lee/
adj. Both {obscure} and {hairy} in the sense of complex. "{Yow}! --- the
tuned assembler implementation of BitBlt is really gnarly!" From a similar
but less specific usage in surfer slang.
