 :blue wire: n. [IBM] Patch wires (esp. 30 AWG gauge) added to circuit boards
at the factory to correct design or fabrication problems. Blue wire is not
necessarily blue, the term describes function rather than color. These may be
necessary if there hasn't been time to design and qualify another board
version. In Great Britain this can be `bodge wire', after mainstream slang
`bodge' for a clumsy improvisation or sloppy job of work. Compare {purple
wire}, {red wire}, {yellow wire}, {pink wire}.
