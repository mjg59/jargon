 :dead link: n. [WWW] A World-Wide-Web URL that no longer points to the
information it was written to reach. Usually this happens because the
document has been moved or deleted. Lots of dead links make a WWW page
frustrating and useless and are the #1 sign of poor page maintainance.
Compare {dangling pointer}.
