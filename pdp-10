 PDP-10 [Programmable Digital Processor model 10] n. The machine that made
timesharing real. Looms large in hacker folklore due to early adoption in the
mid-70s by many university computing facilities and research labs including
the MIT AI lab, Stanford and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction set (most
notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed. The '10
was eventually eclipsed by the PDP-11 and VAX machines and dropped from DEC's
line in the early '80s, and to have cut one's teeth on one is considered
something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers. see TOPS-10,
ITS, Appendix B.
