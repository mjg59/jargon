 :PDP-10: [Programmed Data Processor model 10] n. The machine that made
timesharing real. It looms large in hacker folklore because of its adoption
in the mid-1970s by many university computing facilities and research labs,
including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU. Some aspects of the instruction
set (most notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered
unsurpassed. The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines (descendants
of the PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX product lines were
competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software development
effort on the more profitable VAX. The machine was finally dropped from DEC's
line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a
viable new model. (Some attempts by other companies to market clones came to
nothing; see {Foonly}) This event spelled the doom of {{ITS}} and the
technical cultures that had spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991
it had become something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers
to have cut one's teeth on a PDP-10. see {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}}, {AOS}, {BLT},
