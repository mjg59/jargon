`New Hacker's Dictionary' possibly as early as Fall 1991. The maintainers are
committed to updating the on-line version of the jargon file through and
beyond paper publication, and will continue to make it available to archives
and public-access sites as a trust of the hacker community. Here is a
chronology of the recent on-line revisions: Version 2.1.1, Jun 12 1990: the
jargon file comes alive again after a seven-year hiatus. Reorganization and
massive additions were by Eric S. Raymond, approved by Guy Steele. Many items
of UNIX, C, USENET and microcomputer-based slang were added at that time (as
well as The Untimely Demise of Mabel The Monkey). Some obsolete usages
(mostly PDP-10 derived) were moved to appendix B. Version 2.1.5, Nov 28 1990:
changes and additions by ESR in response to numerous USENET submissions and
comment from the First Edition coauthors. The bibliography (Appendix C) was
also appended. Version 2.2.1, Dec 15 1990: most of the contents of the 1983
paper edition edited by Guy Steele was merged in. Many more USENET
submissions added, including the International Style and <COMMONWEALTH
HACKISH> material. This version had 9394 lines, 75954 words, 490501 chars,
and 1046 entries. Version 2.3.1, Jan 03 1991: the great format change ---
case is no longer smashed in lexicon keys and cross-references. A very few
entries from jargon-1 which were basically straight tech-speak were deleted;
this enabled the rest of Appendix B to be merged back into main text and the
appendix replaced with the Portrait of J. Random Hacker. More USENET
submissions were added. This version had 10728 lines, 85070 words, 558261
characters, and 1138 entries. Version 2.4.1, Jan 14 1991: the Story of Mel
and many more USENET submissions merged in. More material on hackish writing
habits added. Numerous typo fixes. This version had 12362 lines, 97819 words,
