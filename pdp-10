 2. More specifically, to give up on figuring out what the {Right Thing} is
and resort to an inefficient hack. 3. A design decision to defer solving a
problem, typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently
well to frame an algorithmic solution. "No way to know what the right form to
dump the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now." 4. To hand a tricky
implementation problem off to some other section of the design. "It's too
hard to get the compiler to do that; let's punt to the runtime system." 5. To
knock someone off an Internet or chat connection; a `punter' thus, is a
person or program that does this. :Purple Book: n. 1. The "System V Interface
Definition". The covers of the first editions were an amazingly nauseating
shade of off-lavender. 2. Syn. {Wizard Book}. Donald Lewine's "POSIX
Programmer's Guide" (O'Reilly, 1991, ISBN 0-937175-73-0). see also {{book
titles}}. :purple wire: n. [IBM] Wire installed by Field Engineers to work
around problems discovered during testing or debugging. These are called
`purple wires' even when (as is frequently the case) their actual physical
color is yellow.... Compare {blue wire}, {yellow wire}, and {red wire}.
:push: [from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also PUSH
/push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure call
instruction.) 1. To put something onto a {stack} or {PDL}. If one says that
something has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the Damoclean list
of things hanging over ones's head has grown longer and heavier yet. This may
also imply that one will deal with it _before_ other pending items; otherwise
one might say that the thing was `added to my queue'. 2. vi. To enter upon a
digression, to save the current discussion for later. Antonym of {pop}; see
also {stack}, {PDL}. :Python: /pi:'thon/ In the words of its author, "the
other scripting language" (other than {Perl}, that is). Python's design is
notably clean, elegant, and well thought through; it tends to attract the
sort of programmers who find Perl grubby and exiguous. Python's relationship
with Perl is rather like the {BSD} community's relationship to {Linux} - it's
the smaller party in a (usually friendly) rivalry, but the average quality of
its developers is generally conceded to be rather higher than in the larger
community it competes with. There's a Python resource page at
`http://www.python.org'. see also {Guido}. = Q = ===== :quad: n. 1. Two bits;
syn. for {quarter}, {crumb}, {tayste}.
