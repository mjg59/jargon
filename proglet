 :proglet: /prog'let/ [UK] n. A short extempore program written to meet an
immediate, transient need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen
lines long, and contains no subroutines. The largest amount of code that can
be written off the top of one's head, that does not need any editing, and
that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies significantly
according to the language one is using). Compare {toy program}, {noddy},
{one-liner wars}.
