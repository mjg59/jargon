 :proglet: /prog´let/, n. [UK] A short extempore program written to meet an
immediate, transient need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen
lines long, and containing no subroutines. The largest amount of code that
can be written off the top of one's head, that does not need any editing, and
that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies significantly
according to one's skill and the language one is using). Compare {toy
program}, {noddy}, {one-liner wars}.
