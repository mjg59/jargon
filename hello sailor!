 :hello sailor!: interj. Occasional West Coast equivalent of {hello world};
seems to have originated at SAIL, later associated with the game {Zork}
(which also included "hello, aviator" and "hello, implementor"). Originally
from the traditional hooker's greeting to a swabbie fresh off the boat, of
course. The standard response is "Nothing happens here."; of all the
Zork/Dungeon games, only in Infocom's Zork 3 is "Hello, Sailor" actually
useful (excluding the unique situation where _knowing_ this fact is important
in Dungeon...).
