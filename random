 RANDOM adj. 1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical definition); weird.
"The system's been behaving pretty randomly." 2. Assorted; undistinguished.
"Who was at the conference?" "Just a bunch of random business types." 3.
Frivolous; unproductive; undirected (pejorative). "He's just a random loser."
4. Incoherent or inelegant; not well organized. "The program has a random set
of misfeatures." "That's a random name for that function." "Well, all the
names were chosen pretty randomly." 5. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done
and for no good apparent reason. For example, a program that handles file
name defaulting in a particularly useless way, or a routine that could easily
have been coded using only three ac's, but randomly uses seven for assorted
non-overlapping purposes, so that no one else can invoke it without first
saving four extra ac's. 6. In no particular order, though deterministic. "The
I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file is opened one is chosen
randomly." n. 7. A random hacker; used particularly of high school students
who soak up computer time and generally get in the way. 8. (occasional MIT
usage) One who lives at Random Hall. J. RANDOM is often prefixed to a noun to
make a "name" out of it (by comparison to common names such as "J. Fred
Muggs"). The most common uses are "J. Random Loser" and "J. Random Nurd"
("Should J. Random Loser be allowed to gun down other people?"), but it can
be used just as an elaborate version of RANDOM in any sense. [see also the
note at the end of the entry for HACK.]
