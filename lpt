 LPT: /lip'it/ [MIT, via DEC] n. Line printer, of course. Rare under UNIX,
commoner in hackers with MS-DOS or CP/M background. The printer device is
called `LPT:' on those systems which, like ITS, were strongly influenced by
early DEC conventions. lunatic fringe: [IBM] n. Customers who can be relied
upon to accept release 1 versions of software. lurker: n. One of the `silent
majority' in a electronic forum; one who posts occasionally or not at all but
is known to read the group regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed
is casually used reflexively: "Oh, I'm just lurking." Often used in `the
lurkers', the hypothetical audience for the group's {flamage}-emitting
regulars. luser: /loo'zr/ n. A {user}; esp. one who is also a {loser}.
({luser} and {loser} are pronounced identically.) This word was coined about
1975 at MIT. Under ITS, when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and
typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it prints out some status
information, including how many people are already using the computer; it
might print "14 users", for example. Someone thought it would be a great joke
to patch the system to print "14 losers" instead. There ensued a great
controversy, as some of the users didn't particularly want to be called
losers to their faces every time they used the computer. For a while several
hackers struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the
others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it
would say "users" or "losers". Finally, someone tried the compromise
`lusers', and it stuck. Later one of the ITS machines supported `luser' as a
request-for-help command. ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a museum
piece; the usage lives on, however, and the term `luser' is often seen in
program comments. = M = ===== M: pref. (on units) suff. (on numbers) see
{{quantifiers}}. macdink: /mak'dink/ [from the Apple Macintosh, which is said
to encourage such behavior] vt. To make many incremental and unnecessary
cosmetic changes to a program or file. Frequently the subject of the
macdinking would be better off without them. Ex: "When I left at 11pm last
night, he was still macdinking the slides for his presentation." see also
{fritterware}. machinable: adj. Machine-readable. Having the {softcopy}
nature. machoflops: /mach'oh-flops/ [pun on `megaflops', a coinage for
`millions of floating-point operations per second'] n. Refers to artificially
inflated performance figures often quoted by computer manufacturers. Real
applications are lucky to get half the quoted speed. see {Your mileage may
vary}, {benchmark}. Macintoy: /mak'in-toy/ n. The Apple Macintosh, considered
as a {toy}. Less pejorative than {Macintrash}. Macintrash: /mak'in-trash`/ n.
The Apple Macintosh, as described by a hacker who doesn't appreciate being
kept away from the *real computer* by the interface. The term `maggotbox' has
been reported in regular use in the Research Triangle (Raleigh/Durham, NC).
Compare {Macintoy}. see also {WIMP environment}, {drool-proof paper},
{user-friendly}. macro: /mak'roh/ [techspeak] n. A name (possibly followed by
a formal {arg} list) that is equated to a text or symbolic expression to
which it is to be expanded (possibly with the substitution of actual
arguments) by a macro expander. This definition can be found in any technical
dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the
term have changed over time. The term `macro' originated in early assemblers,
which encouraged the use of macros as a structuring and information-hiding
device. During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous and
sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as HLLs, only to fall from favor as
improving compiler technology marginalized assembler programming (see
{languages of choice}). Nowadays the term is most often used in connection
with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages
built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or UNIX's [nt]roff
suite). Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective `macros'
is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose application control
language (whether or not the language is actually translated by text
expansion) as well as other `expansions' such as the `keyboard macros'
supported in some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard
enhancers). macro-: pref. Large. Opposite of {micro-}. In the mainstream and
among other technical cultures (for example, medical people) this competes
with the prefix {mega-}, but hackers tend to restrict the latter to
quantification. macrology: /mak-ro'l*-jee/ n. 1. Set of usually complex or
crufty macros, e.g., as part of a large system written in {LISP}, {TECO}, or
(less commonly) assembler. 2. The art and science involved in comprehending a
macrology in sense #1. Sometimes studying the macrology of a system is not
unlike archeology, ecology, or {theology}, hence the sound-alike
construction. see also {boxology}. macrotape: /ma'kroh-tayp/ n. An industry
standard reel of tape, as opposed to a {microtape}. maggotbox: n. see
{Macintrash}. This is even more derogatory. magic: adj. 1. As yet
unexplained, or too complicated to explain; compare {automagically} and
(Arthur C.) Clarke's Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic." "TTY echoing is controlled by a large number
of magic bits." "This routine magically computes the parity of an eight-bit
byte in three instructions." 2. Characteristic of something that works but no
one really understands why (this is especially called {black magic}). 3.
[Stanford] A feature not generally publicized that allows something otherwise
impossible, or a feature formerly in that category but now unveiled. Example:
The keyboard commands which override the screen-hiding features. Compare
{black magic}, {wizardly}, {deep magic}, {heavy wizardry}. For more about
hackish `magic', see Appendix A. magic cookie: [UNIX] n. 1. Something passed
between routines or programs that enables the receiver to perform some
operation; a capability ticket or opaque identifier. Especially used of small
data objects which contain data encoded in a strange or intrinsically
machine-dependent way. E.g., on non-UNIX OSes with a non-byte-stream model of
files, the result of `ftell(3)' may be a magic cookie rather than a byte
offset; it can be passed to `fseek(3)', but not operated on in any meaningful
way. The phrase `it hands you a magic cookie' means it returns a result whose
contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the same or some
other program later. 2. An in-band code for changing graphic rendition (e.g.,
inverse video or underlining) or performing other control functions. Some
older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to
mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a {glitch}. see also
{cookie}. magic number: [UNIX/C] n. 1. In source code, some non-obvious
constant whose value is significant to the operation of a program and which
is inserted inconspicuously in-line ({hardcoded}), rather than expanded in by
a symbol set by a commented `#define'. Magic numbers in this sense are bad
style. 2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm in
some opaque way. The classic examples of these are the numbers used in hash
or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential generator for
pseudo-random numbers. This sense actually predates and was ancestral to the
more common #1. 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data
file to indicate its type to a utility. Under UNIX the system and various
applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of
executable file by looking for a magic number. Only a {wizard} knows the
magic to create magic numbers. How do you choose a fresh magic number of your
own? Simple --- you pick one at random. see? It's magic! magic smoke: n. A
substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them to function (also
called `blue smoke'; compare `phlogiston'). Its existence is demonstrated by
what happens when a chip burns up --- the magic smoke gets let out, so it
doesn't work any more. see {smoke test}, {let the smoke out}. USENETter Jay
Maynard tells the following story: "Once, while hacking on a dedicated Z80
system, I was testing code by blowing EPROMs and plugging them in the system,
then seeing what happened. One time, I plugged one in backwards. I only
discovered that *after* I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights
under the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs --- the die was glowing
white-hot. Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased it, filled it full
of zeros, then erased it again. For all I know, it's still in service. Of
course, this is because the magic smoke didn't get let out." mailing list: n.
(often shortened to `list') 1. An {email} address that is an alias (or
{macro}, though that word is never used in this connection) for many other
email addresses. Some mailing lists are simple `reflectors', redirecting mail
sent to them to the list of recipients. Others are filtered by humans or
programs of varying degrees of sophistication; lists filtered by humans are
said to be `moderated'. 2. The people who receive your email when you send it
to such an address. Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker
interaction, along with {USENET}. They predate USENET, and originated with
the first UUCP and ARPANET connections. They are often used for private
information-sharing on topics that would be too specialized for or
inappropriate to public USENET groups. While some of these maintain purely
technical content (such as the Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list),
others (like the `sf-lovers' list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe)
are recreational, and others are purely social. Perhaps the most infamous of
the social lists was the eccentric `bandykin' distribution; its latter-day
progeny, `lectroids' and `tanstaafl', still include a number of the oddest
and most interesting people in hackerdom. Mailing lists are easy to create
and (unlike USENET) don't tie up a significant amount of machine resources.
Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups who can then
collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet face-to-face. Much of
the material in this book was criticized and polished on just such a mailing
list (called `jargon-friends'), which included all the co-authors of the `The
Hacker's Dictionary' first edition. main loop: n. Software tools are often
written to perform some actions repeatedly on whatever input is handed to
them, terminating when there is no more input or they are explicitly told to
go away. In such programs, the loop that gets and processes input is called
the `main loop'. see also {driver}. mainframe: n. This term originally
referred to the cabinet containing the central processor unit or `main frame'
of a room-filling {Stone Age} batch machine. After the emergence of smaller
`minicomputer' designs in the early Seventies, the traditional {big iron}
machines were described as `mainframe computers' and eventually just as
mainframes. The term carries the connotation of a machine designed for batch
rather than interactive use, though possibly with an interactive timesharing
operating system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built
by IBM, Unisys, and the other great {dinosaur}s surviving from computing's
{Stone Age}. It is common wisdom among hackers that the mainframe
architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside of the tiny market for
{number-crunching} supercomputers (see {cray})), swamped by the recent huge
advances in IC technology and low-cost personal computing. As of 1991,
corporate America hasn't quite figured this out yet, though the wave of
failures, takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers are
certainly straws in the wind. management: n. 1. Corporate power elites
distinguished primarily by their distance from actual productive work and
their chronic failure to manage (see also {suit}). Spoken derisively, as in
"*Management* decided that...". 2. Mythically, a vast bureaucracy responsible
for all the world's minor irritations. Hackers' satirical public notices are
often signed `The Mgmt'. manged: /mahnjed/ [probably from the French `manger'
or Italian `mangiare', to eat; perh. influenced by English n. `mange',
`mangy']. adj. Refers to anything that is mangled or damaged, usually beyond
repair. "The disk was manged after the electrical storm." Compare {mung}.
mangle: vt. Used similarly to {mung} or {scribble}, but more violent in its
connotations; something that is mangled has been irreversibly and totally
trashed. mangler: [DEC] n. A manager. Compare {mango}; see also {management}.
Note that {system mangler} is somewhat different in connotation. mango:
/mang'go/ [orig. in-house jargon at Symbolics] n. A manager. Compare
{mangler}. see also {devo} and {doco}. marginal: adj. 1. Extremely small. "A
marginal increase in {core} can decrease {GC} time drastically." In everyday
terms, this means that it's a lot easier to clean off your desk if you have a
spare place to put some of the junk while you sort through it. 2. Of
extremely small merit. "This proposed new feature seems rather marginal to
me." 3. Of extremely small probability of {win}ning. "The power supply was
rather marginal anyway; no wonder it fried." Marginal Hacks: n. Margaret
Jacks Hall, a building into which the Stanford AI Lab was moved near the
beginning of the 1980s (from the {D. C. Power Lab}). marginally: adv.
Slightly. "The ravs here are only marginally better than at Small Eating
Place." see {epsilon}. marketroid: /mar'k*-troyd/ alt. `marketing slime',
`marketing droid', `marketeer' n. Member of a company's marketing department,
esp. one who promises users that the next version of a product will have
features that are not actually scheduled for inclusion, extremely difficult
to implement, and/or are in violation of the laws of physics; and/or one who
describes existing features (and misfeatures) in ebullient, buzzword-laden
adspeak. Derogatory. Compare {droid}. martian: n. A packet sent on a TCP/IP
network with a source address of the test loopback interface (127.0.0.1).
This means that it will come back at you labelled with a source address that
is clearly not of this earth. As in "The domain server is getting lots of
packets from Mars. Does that gateway have a martian filter?" massage: vt.
Vague term used to describe `smooth' transformations of a data set into a
different form, esp. transformations that do not lose information. Connotes
less pain than {munch} or {crunch}. "He wrote a program that massages X
bitmap files into GIF format." Compare {slurp}. math-out: [poss. from
`white-out' (the blizzard variety)] n. A paper or presentation so encrusted
with mathematical or other formal notation as to be incomprehensible. This
may be a device for concealing the fact that it is actually {content-free}.
see also {numbers}, {social science number}. Matrix: [FidoNet] n. 1. What the
Opus BBS software and sysops call {FidoNet}. 2. Fanciful term for a
{cyberspace} expected to emerge from current networking experiments (see
{network, the}). Some people refer to the totality of present networks this
way. Mbogo, Dr. Fred: [Stanford] n. The archetypal man you don't want to see
about a problem, esp. an incompetent professional; a shyster. Usage: "Do you
know a good eye doctor?" "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry
Cleaning." The name comes from synergy between {bogus} and the original Dr.
Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the old `Addams
Family' TV show. see also {fred}. meatware: n. Synonym for {wetware}. Less
common. meeces: [TMRC] n. Occasional furry visitors who are not {urchin}s.
[That is, mice. This may no longer be in live use; it clearly derives from
the refrain of the old Tom an Jerry cartoons "I hate meeces to *pieces*!" --
ESR] meg: /meg/ n. see {{quantifiers}}. mega-: /me'g*/ pref. see
{{quantifiers}}. megapenny: /meg'*-pen'ee/ n. $10,000 (1 cent * 10 ^ 6). Used
semi-humorously as a unit in comparing computer cost/performance figures.
