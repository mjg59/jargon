 LPT: /lip'it/ [ITS] n. Line printer, of course. Rare under UNIX, commoner in
hackers with MS-DOS or CP/M background (the printer device is called LPT: on
those systems, which like ITS were strongly influenced by early DEC
conventions). lunatic fringe: [IBM] n. Customers who can be relied upon to
accept release 1 versions of software. lurker: n. One of the `silent
majority' in a {USENET} or BBS newsgroup; one who posts occasionally or not
at all but is known to read the group regularly. Often used in `the lurkers',
the hypothetical audience for the group's {flamage}-emitting regulars. luser:
/loo'zr/ n. A {user} who is probably also a {loser}. ({luser} and {loser} are
pronounced identically.) This word was coined about 1975 at MIT. Under ITS,
when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the
computer's attention, it prints out some status information, including how
many people are already using the computer; it might print "14 users", for
example. Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to
print "14 losers" instead. There ensued a great controversy, as some of the
users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces every time
they used the computer. For a while several hackers struggled covertly, each
changing the message behind the back of the others; any time you logged into
the computer it was even money whether it would say "users" or "losers".
Finally, someone tried the compromise `lusers', and it stuck. Later one of
the ITS machines supported `luser' as a request-for-help command. ITS
effectively died in early 1990, except as a museum piece; the usage lives on,
however, and the term `luser' is often seen in program comments. M - M: [from
{mega-}] /em/ n. A megabyte (1,024 kilobytes, 1,048,576 bytes). Also written
MB (this conflicts with use of M by scientists, under which MB would denote
1,000,000-byte units). see also {kilo-}, {K}. macdink: /mak'dink/ [from the
Apple Macintosh, which is said to encourage such behavior] vt. To make many
incremental and unnecessary cosmetic changes to a program or file. Frequently
the subject of the macdinking would be better off without them. Ex: "When I
left at 11pm last night, he was still macdinking the slides for his
presentation." see also {fritterware}. machoflops: /mach'oh-flops/ [pun on
`megaflops', a coinage for `millions of floating-point operations per
second'] n. Refers to artificially inflated performance figures often quoted
by computer manufacturers. Real applications are lucky to get half the quoted
speed. see {Your mileage may vary.}, {benchmark}. Macintrash: /mak'in-trash`/
n. The Apple Macintosh, as described by a hacker who doesn't appreciate being
kept away from the *real computer* by the interface. see also {WIMP
environment}, {drool-proof paper}, {user-friendly}. macro: /mak'roh/ n. A
name (possibly followed by a formal {arg} list) which is equated to a text
expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with substitution of
actual arguments) by a language translator. This definition can be found in
any technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the hackish
connotations of the term have changed over time. The term `macro' originated
in early assemblers, which encouraged use of macros as a structuring and
information-hiding device. During the early 1970s macro assemblers became
ubiquitous and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as HLLs, only to
fall from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler
programming (see {languages of choice}). Nowadays the term is most often used
in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several
special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion facility (such as
TeX or UNIX's [nt]roff suite). Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that
the collective `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose
application-control language (whether or not the language is actually
translated by text expansion) as well as other `expansions' such as the
`keyboard macros' supported in some text editors (and PC TSR keyboard
enhancers). macro-: pref. Large. Opposite of {micro-}. In the mainstream and
among other technical cultures (for example, medical people) this competes
with the prefix {mega-}, but hackers tend to restrict the latter to
quantification. macrology: /mak-ro'l@-jee/ n. 1. Set of usually complex or
crufty macros, e.g. as part of a large system written in {LISP}, {TECO}, or
(less commonly) assembler. 2. The art and science involved in comprehending a
macrology in sense #1. Sometimes studying the macrology of a system is not
unlike archeology, ecology and {theology}, hence the sound-alike
construction. macrotape: /ma'kroh-tayp/ n. An industry standard reel of tape,
as opposed to a {microtape}. magic: adj. 1. As yet unexplained, or too
complicated to explain; compare {automagically} and (Arthur C.) Clarke's
Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic". "TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of magic bits." "This
routine magically computes the parity of an eight-bit byte in three
instructions." 2. Characteristic of something that works but no one really
understands why. 3. [Stanford] A feature not generally publicized that allows
something otherwise impossible, or a feature formerly in that category but
now unveiled. Example: The keyboard commands which override the screen-hiding
features. magic cookie: [UNIX] n. 1. Something passed between routines or
programs that enables the receiver to perform some operation; a capability
ticket or opaque identifier. Especially used of small data objects which
contain data encoded in a strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way. For
example, on non-UNIX OSes with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result
of `ftell(3)' may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be
passed to `fseek(3)', but not operated on in any meaningful way. The phrase
"It hands you a magic cookie" means it returns a result whose contents are
not defined but which can be passes back to the same program later to refer
back to this transaction. 2. An in-band code for changing graphic rendition
(e.g. inverse video or underlining) or performing other control functions.
Some older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to
mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a {glitch}. see also
{cookie}. magic number: [UNIX/C] n. 1. Special data located at the beginning
of a binary data file to indicate its type to a utility. Under UNIX the
system and various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish
between types of executable by looking for a magic number. Only a {wizard}
knows the magic to create magic numbers. How do you create a magic number
that nobody else is using? Simple --- you pick one at random. see? It's
magic! 2. In source code, some non-obvious constant whose value is
significant to the operation of a program and which is inserted
inconspicuously in line ({hardcoded}), rather than expanded in by a symbol
set by a commented #define. Magic numbers in this sense are bad style. magic
smoke: n. A notional substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them
to function (also called `blue smoke'). Its existence is demonstrated by what
happens when a chip burns up --- the magic smoke gets let out, so it doesn't
work any more. see {smoke test}, {let the smoke out}. USENETter Jay Maynard
tells the following story: "Once, while hacking on a dedicated Z-80 system, I
was testing code by blowing EPROMs and plugging them in the system, then
seeing what happened. One time, I plugged one in backwards. I only discovered
that *after* I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights under the
quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs --- the die was glowing white-hot.
Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased it, filled it full of zeros,
then erased it again. For all I know, it's still in service. Of course, this
is because the magic smoke didn't get let out." mailing list: n. (often
shortened to `list') 1. An {email} address that is an alias (or {macro},
though that word is never used in this connection) for many other email
addresses. 2. The people who receive your email when you send it to such an
address. Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
along with {USENET}. They predate USENET, and originated with the first UUCP
and ARPANET connections. They are often used for private information-sharing
on topics that would be too specialized for or inappropriate in public USENET
groups. While some of these maintain purely technical content (such as the
Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the `sf-lovers'
list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are recreational, and others
are purely social. Perhaps the most infamous of the social lists was the
eccentric `bandykin' distribution; its latter-day progeny, `lectroids' and
`tanstaafl', still include a number of the oddest and most interesting people
in hackerdom. Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike USENET) don't tie
up a significant amount of machine resources. Thus, they are often created
temporarily by working groups who can then collaborate on a project without
ever needing to meet face-to-face. Much of the material in this book was
criticized and polished on just such a mailing list (called `jargon-friends')
which included all the co-authors of the original `The Hacker's Dictionary'.
main loop: n. Software tools are often written to perform some action
repeatedly on whatever input is handed to them, terminating when there is no
more input or they are explicitly told to go away. In such programs, the loop
that gets and processes input is called the `main loop'. see also {driver}.
mainframe: n. This term originally referred to the central processor unit
cabinet or `main frame' of a room-filling {Stone Age} batch machine. After
the emergence of smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early Seventies, the
traditional {big iron} machines were described as `mainframe computers' and
eventually just as mainframes. The term carries the implication of a machine
designed for batch rather than interactive use, though possibly with an
interactive timesharing operating system retrofitted onto it; it is
especially used of machines built by IBM, Sperry Univac, Unisys and the other
great megatheria surviving from computing's Pleistocene. Outside the tiny
market for specialized number-crunching supercomputers (see {cray}), it is
common wisdom among hackers that the mainframe architectural tradition is
essentially dead now, swamped by the huge advances in IC technology and
`personal' lower-cost computing. As of 1991, corporate America hasn't quite
figured this out yet, though the wave of failures, takeovers, and mergers
among traditional mainframe makers are certainly straws in the wind. see also
{dinosaur}. management: n. 1. Corporate power elites distinguished primarily
by their distance from actual productive work and their chronic failure to
manage (see also {suit}). Spoken derisively, as in "*Management* decided
that...". 2. Mythically, a vast bureaucracy responsible for all the world's
minor irritations. Hackers' satirical public notices are often signed "The
Mgmt". manged: /mahnjed/ [probably from the French manger, to eat; perh.
influenced by English n. `mange', adj. `mangy']. Refers to anything that is
mangled or damaged, usually beyond repair. "The disk was manged after the
electrical storm." Compare {mung}. mangle: vt. Used similarly to {mung} or
{scribble}, but more violent in its connotations; something that is mangled
has been irreversibly and totally trashed. mangler: [DEC] n. A manager.
Compare {mango}; see also {management}. Note that {system mangler} is
somwehat different in connotation. mango: /mang'go/ [orig. in-house slang at
Symbolics] n. A manager. Compare {mangler}. see also {devo} and {doco}.
marginal: adj. 1. Extremely small. "A marginal increase in {core} can
decrease {GC} time drastically." In everyday terms, this means that it's a
lot easier to clean off your desk if you have a spare place to put some of
the junk while you sort through it. 2. Of extremely small merit. "This
proposed new feature seems rather marginal to me." 3. Of extremely small
probability of winning. "The power supply was rather marginal anyway; no
wonder it fried." marginally: adv. Slightly. "The ravs here are only
marginally better than at Small Eating Place." see {epsilon}. Marginal Hacks:
n. Margaret Jacks Hall, a building into which the Stanford AI Lab was moved
near the beginning of the `80s. marketroid: /mar'k@-troyd/ alt. `marketing
slime', `marketing droid', `marketeer' n. Member of a company's marketing
department, esp. one who promises users that the next version of a product
will have features that are unplanned, extremely difficult to implement,
and/or violate the laws of physics; and/or one who describes existing
features (and misfeatures) in ebullient, buzzword-laden adspeak. Derogatory.
martian: n. A packet sent on a TCP/IP network with a source address of the
test loopback interface (127.0.0.1). As in "The domain server is getting lots
of packets from Mars. Does that gateway have a martian filter?" massage: vt.
Vague term used to describe `smooth' transformations of a data set into a
more useful form, esp. transformations that do not lose information. Connotes
less pain than {munch} or {crunch}. "He wrote a program that massages X
bitmap files into GIF format." Compare {slurp}. math-out: [poss. from
`white-out' (the blizzard variety)] n. A paper or presentation so encrusted
with mathematical or other formal notation as to be incomprehensible. This
may be a device for concealing the fact that it is actually {content-free}.
see also {numbers}, {social science number}. Matrix: [FidoNet] n. 1. What the
Opus BBS software and sysops call {FidoNet}. 2. Fanciful term for a
{cyberspace} expected to emerge from current networking experiments (see
{network, the}). Some people refer to the totality of present networks this
way. Mbogo, Dr. Fred: [Stanford] n. The archetypal man you don't want to see
about a problem, esp. an incompetent professional; a shyster. Usage: "Do you
know a good eye doctor?" "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and Professional Dry
Cleaning." The name comes from synergy between {bogus} and the original Dr.
Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the old `Addams
Family' TV show. meatware: n. Synonym for {wetware}. Less common. meg: /meg/
n. A megabyte; 1024K. see {M} and {K}. mega-: /me'g@/ pref. Multiplier, 10 ^
6 or 2 ^ 20. see {M}, {kilo-}. megapenny: /meg'@-pen'ee/ n. $10,000 (1 cent *
10 ^ 6). Used semi-humorously as a unit in comparing computer
cost/performance figures.
