 :LPT: /L-P-T/ or /lip'it/ or /lip-it'/ n. 1. Line printer (originally Line
Printing Terminal). Rare under Unix, more common among hackers who grew up
with ITS, MS-DOS, CP/M and other operating systems that were strongly
influenced by early {DEC} conventions. 2. Local PorT. Used among
MS-DOS/Windows programmers (and so expanded in the MS-DOS 5 manual). It seems
likely this is a {backronym}.
