 :open source: n. [common; also adj. open-source] Term coined in March 1998
following the Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source
under licenses guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and
redistribute, the code. The intent was to be able to sell the hackers' ways
of doing software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the negative
connotations (to {suit}s) of the term "{free software}". For discussion of
the follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the Open Source Initiative
site.
