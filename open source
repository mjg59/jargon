 :open source: n. [common; also adj. open-source] Term coined in March 1998
following the Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source
under licenses guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and
redistribute, the code. The intent was to be able to sell the hackers' ways
of doing software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the negative
connotations (to {suit}s) of the term "{free software}". For discussion of
the follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the Open Source Initiative
site. Five years after this term was invented, in 2003, it is worth noting
the huge shift in assumptions it helped bring about, if only because the
hacker culture's collective memory of what went before is in some ways
blurring. Hackers have so completely refocused themselves around the idea and
ideal of open source that we are beginning to forget that we used to do most
of our work in closed-source environments. Until the late 1990s open source
was a sporadic exception that usually had to live on top of a closed-source
operating system and alongside closed-source tools; entire open-source
environments like {Linux} and the *BSD systems didn't even exist in a usable
form until around 1993 and weren't taken very seriously by anyone but a
pioneering few until about five years later.
