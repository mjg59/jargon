 :ANSI standard: /an´see stan´d@rd/ The ANSI standard usage of ANSI standard
refers to any practice which is typical or broadly done. It's most
appropriately applied to things that everyone does that are not quite
regulation. For example: ANSI standard shaking of a laser printer cartridge
to get extra life from it, or the ANSI standard word tripling in names of
usenet alt groups. This usage derives from the American National Standards
Institute. ANSI, along with the International Organization for Standards
(ISO), standardized the C programming language (see {K&R}, {Classic C}), and
promulgates many other important software standards.
