 :Zork: /zork/ n. The second of the great early experiments in computer
fantasy gaming; see {ADVENT}. Originally written on MIT-DM during the late
1970s, later distributed with BSD UNIX (as a patched, sourceless RT-11
Fortran binary; see {retrocomputing}) and commercialized as `The Zork
Trilogy' by Infocom. The Fortran source was later rewritten for portability
and released to USENET under the name "Dungeon". Both Fortran "Dungeon" and
translated C versions are available at many FTP sites.
