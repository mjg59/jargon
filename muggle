 :muggle: [from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, 1998] A non-{wizard}. Not
as disparaging as {luser}; implies vague pity rather than contempt. In the
universe of Rowling's enormously (and deservedly) popular children's series,
muggles and wizards inhabit the same modern world, but each group is ignorant
of the commonplaces of the others' existence -- most muggles are unaware that
wizards exist, and wizards (used to magical ways of doing everything) are
perplexed and fascinated by muggle artifacts. In retrospect it seems
completely inevitable that hackers would adopt this metaphor, and in hacker
usage it readily forms compounds such as muggle-friendly. Compare {luser},
{mundane}, {chainik}, {newbie}.
