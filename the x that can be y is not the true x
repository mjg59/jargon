 :the X that can be Y is not the true X: Yet another instance of hackerdom's
peculiar attraction to mystical references --- a common humorous way of

implication is often that the X is a mystery accessible only to the
enlightened. see the {trampoline} entry for an example, and compare {has the
X nature}.
