 :cow orker: n. [Usenet] n. fortuitous typo for co-worker, widely used in
Usenet, with perhaps a hint that orking cows is illegal. This term was
popularized by Scott Adams (the creator of {Dilbert}) but already appears in
the January 1996 version of the {scary devil monastery} FAQ. There are
plausible reports that it was in use on talk.bizarre as early as 1992.
Compare {hing}, {grilf}, {filk}, {newsfroup}.
