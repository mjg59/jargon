 :rip: v. 1. To extract the digital representation of a piece of music from
an audio CD. Software that does this is often called a "CD ripper". 2. [Amiga
hackers] To extract sound or graphics from a program that they have been
compiled/assembled into, or which generates them at run-time. In the case of
older Amiga games this entails searching through memory shortly after a
reboot. This sense has been in use for many years and probably gave rise to
the (now more common) sense 1.
