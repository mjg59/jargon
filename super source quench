 :super source quench: n. A special packet designed to shut up an Internet
host. The Internet Protocol (IP) has a control message called Source Quench
that asks a host to transmit more slowly on a particular connection to avoid
congestion. It also has a Redirect control message intended to instruct a
host to send certain packets to a different local router. A "super source
quench" is actually a redirect control packet, forged to look like it came
from a local router, that instructs a host to send all packets to its own
local loopback address. This will effectively tie many Internet hosts up in
knots. Compare {Godzillagram}, {breath-of-life packet}.
