 :pixel sort: n. [Commodore users] Any compression routine which
irretrievably loses valuable data in the process of {crunch}ing it.
Disparagingly used for `lossy' methods such as JPEG. The theory, of course,
is that these methods are only used on photographic images in which minor
loss-of-data is not visible to the human eye. The term `pixel sort' implies
distrust of this theory. Compare {bogo-sort}.
