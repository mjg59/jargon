 :marbles: /pl.n./ [from mainstream "lost all his/her marbles"] The minimum
needed to build your way further up some hierarchy of tools or abstractions.
After a bad system crash, you need to determine if the machine has enough
marbles to come up on its own, or enough marbles to allow a rebuild from
backups, or if you need to rebuild from scratch. "This compiler doesn't even
have enough marbles to compile {hello, world}."
