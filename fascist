 :fascist: adj. 1. [common] Said of a computer system with excessive or
annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access policies. The implication
is that said policies are preventing hackers from getting interesting work
done. The variant `fascistic' seems to have been preferred at MIT, poss. by
analogy with `touristic' (see {tourist} or under the influence of
German/Yiddish `faschistisch'). 2. In the design of languages and other
software tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most restrictive and
structured way of capturing a particular function; the implication is that
this may be desirable in order to simplify the implementation or provide
tighter error checking. Compare {bondage-and-discipline language}, although
that term is global rather than local.
