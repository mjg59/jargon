 :fossil: n. 1. In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in
historical context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break
compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string
escapes in {C}, in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to ASCII and
modern byte-addressable architectures. see {dusty deck}. 2. More
restrictively, a feature with past but no present utility. Example: the
force-all-caps (LCASE) bits in the V7 and {BSD} UNIX tty driver, designed for
use with monocase terminals. In a perversion of the usual
backward-compatibility goal, this functionality has actually been expanded
and renamed in some later {USG UNIX} releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits. 3.
The FOSSIL (Fido/Opus/Seadog Standard Interface Level) driver specification
for serial-port access to replace the {brain-dead} routines in the IBM PC
ROMs. Fossils are used by most MS-DOS {BBS} software in preference to the
`supported' ROM routines, which do not support interrupt-driven operation or
setting speeds above 9600; the use of a semistandard FOSSIL library is
preferable to the {bare metal} serial port programming otherwise required.
Since the FOSSIL specification allows additional functionality to be hooked
in, drivers that use the {hook} but do not provide serial-port access
themselves are named with a modifier, as in `video fossil'.
