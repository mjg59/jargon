 FOSSIL n. 1. In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in
historical context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break
compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string
escapes in C in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to modern
byte-addressible architectures. see DUSTY DECKS. 2. More restrictively, a
feature with past but no present utility. Example: the force-all-caps (LCASE)
bits in the V7 and BSD UNIX tty driver, designed for use with monocase
terminals. In a perversion of the usual backwards compatibility goal, this
functionality has actually been expanded and renamed in some later USG UNIX
releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits.
