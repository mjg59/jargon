 FOSSIL n. 1. In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in
historical context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break
compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string
escapes in C in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to modern
byte-addressible architectures. see DUSTY DECKS. 2. More restrictively, a
feature with past but no present utility. Example: the force-all-caps
(IUCLC/OLCUC) bits in the UNIX tty driver, designed for use with monocase
terminals.
