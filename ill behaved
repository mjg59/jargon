 ILL BEHAVED adj. Software which bypasses the defined OS interfaces to do
things (like screen, keyboard and disk I/O) itself, often in a way that
depends on the hardware of the machine it is running on or which is
nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of software. In the IBM
PC/MS-DOS world, where this term originated, there is a folk theorem to the
effect that (due to gross inadequacies and performance penalties in the OS
interface) all interesting applications are ill-behaved. Oppose WELL-BEHAVED.
see MESS-DOS.
