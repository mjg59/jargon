 :Knuth: /ka-nooth'/ n. [Donald E. Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming"]
Mythically, the reference that answers all questions about data structures or
algorithms. A safe answer when you do not know: "I think you can find that in
Knuth." Contrast {the literature}. see also {bible}. There is a Donald Knuth
home page at `http://Sunburn.Stanford.EDU/~knuth/'.
