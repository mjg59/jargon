 :regexp: /reg'eksp/ n. [UNIX] (alt. `regex' or `reg-ex') 1. Common written
and spoken abbreviation for `regular expression', one of the wildcard
patterns used, e.g., by UNIX utilities such as `grep(1)', `sed(1)', and
`awk(1)'. These use conventions similar to but more elaborate than those
described under {glob}. For purposes of this lexicon, it is sufficient to
note that regexps also allow complemented character sets using `^'; thus, one
can specify `any non-alphabetic character' with `[^A-Za-z]'. 2. Name of a
well-known PD regexp-handling package in portable C, written by revered
USENETter Henry Spencer <henry@zoo.toronto.edu>.
