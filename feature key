 :feature key: n. The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf graphic on its
keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower', `pretzel', `clover', `propeller',
`beanie' (an apparent reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie),
{splat}, or the `command key'. The Mac's equivalent of an {alt} key. The
proliferation of terms for this creature may illustrate one subtle peril of
iconic interfaces. Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like
symbol that appears on the feature key. Its oldest name is `cross of St.
Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative motif.
Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to mark sites of
historical interest. Though this symbol technically stands for the word
`sev"ardhet' (interesting feature) many of these are old churches; hence, the
Swedish idiom for the symbol is `kyrka', cognate to English `church' and
Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in modern Swedish. This is in
fact where Apple got the symbol; they give the translation "interesting
feature"!
