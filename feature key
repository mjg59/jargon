 :feature key: n. The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf graphic on its
keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower', `pretzel', `clover', `propeller',
`beanie' (an apparent reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie),
{splat}, or the `command key'. The Mac's equivalent of an {alt} key (and so
labeled on on some Mac II keyboards). The proliferation of terms for this
creature may illustrate one subtle peril of iconic interfaces. Many people
have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that appears on the feature
key. Its oldest name is `cross of St. Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian
Viking art as a decorative motif. Throughout Scandinavia today the road
agencies use it to mark sites of historical interest. Apple picked up the
symbol from an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish. Apple
documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"! There is some
dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol. It technically stands
for the word `sev"ardhet' (interesting feature) many of these are old
churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to
English `church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in modern
Swedish. Others say this is nonsense.
