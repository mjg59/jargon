 :Microsloth Windows: /mi:'kroh-sloth` win'dohz/ n. Hackerism for `Microsoft
Windows', a windowing system for the IBM-PC which is so limited by
bug-for-bug compatibility with {mess-dos} that it is agonizingly slow on
anything less than a fast 486. Also just called `Windoze', with the
implication that you can fall asleepm waiting for it to do anything; the
latter term is extremely common on USENET. Compare {X}, {sun-stools}.
