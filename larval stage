 :larval stage: /n./ Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration on
coding apparently passed through by all fledgling hackers. Common symptoms
include the perpetration of more than one 36-hour {hacking run} in a given
week; neglect of all other activities including usual basics like food,
sleep, and personal hygiene; and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye. Can
last from 6 months to 2 years, the apparent median being around 18 months. A
few so afflicted never resume a more `normal' life, but the ordeal seems to
be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to merely competent)
programmers. see also {wannabee}. A less protracted and intense version of
larval stage (typically lasting about a month) may recur when one is learning
a new {OS} or programming language.
