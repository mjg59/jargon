 LARVAL STAGE (lar'vl stayj) n. Describes a period of monomaniacal
concentration on coding apparently passed through by all fledgeling hackers.
Common symptoms include: the perpetration of more than one 36-hour HACKING
RUN in a given week, neglect of all other activities including usual basics
like food and sex, and a chronic case of advanced bleary-eye. Can last from
six months to two years, with the apparent median being around eighteen
months. A few so afflicted never resume a more `normal' life, but the ordeal
seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to merely
competent) programmers. A less protracted and intense version of larval stage
(typically lasting about a month) may recur when learning a new OS or
programming language.
