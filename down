 :down: 1. adj. Not operating. "The up escalator is down" is considered a
humorous thing to say, and "The elevator is down" always means "The elevator
isn't working" and never refers to what floor the elevator is on. With
respect to computers, this usage has passed into the mainstream; the
extension to other kinds of machine is still hackish. 2. `go down' vi. To
stop functioning; usually said of the {system}. The message from the
{console} that every hacker hates to hear from the operator is "The system
will go down in 5 minutes". 3. `take down', `bring down' vt. To deactivate
purposely, usually for repair work or {PM}. "I'm taking the system down to
work on that bug in the tape drive." Occasionally one hears the word `down'
by itself used as a verb in this vt. sense. see {crash}; oppose {up}.
