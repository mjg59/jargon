 DOWN 1. adj. Not working. "The up escalator is down." That is considered a
humorous thing to say, but "The elevator is down" always means "The elevator
isn't working" and never refers to what floor the elevator is on. 2. GO DOWN
vi. To stop functioning; usually said of the SYSTEM. The message every hacker
hates to hear from the operator is, "The system will go down in five
minutes." 3. TAKE DOWN, BRING DOWN vt. To deactivate purposely, usually for
repair work. "I'm taking the system down to work on that bug in the tape
drive."
