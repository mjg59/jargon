 :loop through: /vt./ To process each element of a list of things. "Hold on,
I've got to loop through my paper mail." Derives from the computer-language
notion of an iterative loop; compare `cdr down' (under {cdr}), which is less
common among C and Unix programmers. ITS hackers used to say `IRP over' after
an obscure pseudo-op in the MIDAS PDP-10 assembler (the same IRP op can
nowadays be found in Microsoft's assembler).
