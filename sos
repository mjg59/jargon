 SOS n. 1. /sahss/ Inverse of AOS, from the PDP-10 instruction set. 2.
/ess-oh-ess/ An infamously LOSING text editor. Once, back in the 1960's, when
a text editor was needed for the PDP-6, a hacker CRUFTED TOGETHER a
quick-and-dirty "stopgap editor" to be used until a better one was written.
Unfortunately, the old one was never really discarded when new ones (in
particular, TECO) came along. SOS is a descendant of that editor; SOS means
"Son of Stopgap", and many PDP-10 users gained the dubious pleasure of its
axquaintance. [Since then other programs similar in style to SOS have been
written, notably BILOS (bye'lohss) the Brother-In-Law Of Stopgap.] see also
TECO.
