 :SOS: n.,obs. /S-O-S/ 1. An infamously {losing} text editor. Once, back in
the 1960s, when a text editor was needed for the PDP-6, a hacker crufted
together a {quick-and-dirty} `stopgap editor' to be used until a better one
was written. Unfortunately, the old one was never really discarded when new
ones (in particular, {TECO}) came along. SOS is a descendant (`Son of
Stopgap') of that editor, and many PDP-10 users gained the dubious pleasure
of its acquaintance. Since then other programs similar in style to SOS have
been written, notably the early font editor BILOS /bye'lohs/, the
Brother-In-Law Of Stopgap (the alternate expansion `Bastard Issue, Loins of
Stopgap' has been proposed). 2. /sos/ vt. To decrease; inverse of {AOS}, from
the PDP-10 instruction set.
