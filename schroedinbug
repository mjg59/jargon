 :schroedinbug: [MIT: from the Schroedinger's Cat thought-experiment in
quantum physics] n. A design or implementation bug in a program which doesn't
manifest until someone reading source or using the program in an unusual way
notices that it never should have worked, at which point the program promptly
stops working for everybody until fixed. Though this sounds impossible, it
happens; some programs have harbored latent schroedinbugs for years. Compare
{heisenbug}, {Bohr bug}, {mandelbug}.
