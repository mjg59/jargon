 :schroedinbug: /shroh´din·buhg/, n. [MIT: from the Schroedinger's Cat
thought-experiment in quantum physics] A design or implementation bug in a
program that doesn't manifest until someone reading source or using the
program in an unusual way notices that it never should have worked, at which
point the program promptly stops working for everybody until fixed. Though
(like {bit rot}) this sounds impossible, it happens; some programs have
harbored latent schroedinbugs for years. Compare {heisenbug}, {Bohr bug},
{mandelbug}.
