 FLAKEY, FLAKY adj. Subject to frequent lossages. see LOSSAGE. This use is of
course related to the common slang use of the word, to describe a person as
eccentric or crazy. A system that is flakey is working, sort of, enough that
you are tempted to try to use it, but it fails frequently enough that the
odds in favor of finishing what you start are low. Commonwealth hackish
prefers DODGY (q.v.).
