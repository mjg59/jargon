 :This time, for sure!: excl. Ritual affirmation frequently uttered during
protracted debugging sessions involving numerous small obstacles (e.g.,
attempts to bring up a UUCP connection). For the proper effect, this must be
uttered in a fruity imitation of Bullwinkle J. Moose. Also heard: "Hey,
Rocky! Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!" The {canonical} response is, of
course, "But that trick *never* works!" see {{Humor, Hacker}}.
