 EOF (ee-oh-ef) [UNIX/C] n. End Of File. 1. Refers esp. to whatever
pseudo-character value is returned by C's sequential input functions (and
their equivalents in other environments) when the logical end of file has
been reached (this was 0 under V6 UNIX, is -1 under V7 and all subsequent
versions and all non-UNIX C library implementations). 2. Used by extension in
non-computer contexts when a human is doing something that can be modelled as
a sequential read and can't go further. "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360
mnemonics to post as a joke, but I hit EOF pretty fast, all the library had
was a JCL manual."
