 :EOF: /E-O-F/ n. [abbreviation, `End Of File'] 1. [techspeak] The
{out-of-band} value returned by C's sequential character-input functions (and
their equivalents in other environments) when end of file has been reached.
This value is usually -1 under C libraries postdating V6 Unix, but was
originally 0. DOS hackers think EOF is ^Z, and a few Amiga hackers think it's
^\. 2. [Unix] The keyboard character (usually control-D, the ASCII EOT (End
Of Transmission) character) that is mapped by the terminal driver into an
end-of-file condition. 3. Used by extension in non-computer contexts when a
human is doing something that can be modeled as a sequential read and can't
go further. "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke,
but I hit EOF pretty fast; all the library had was a {JCL} manual." see also
{EOL}.
