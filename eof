 EOF: /E-O-F/ [acronym, `End Of File'] n. 1. [techspeak] Refers esp. to
whatever {out-of-band} value is returned by C's sequential character-input
functions (and their equivalents in other environments) when end of file has
been reached. This value is -1 under C libraries postdating V6 UNIX, but was
originally 0. 2. Used by extension in non-computer contexts when a human is
doing something that can be modeled as a sequential read and can't go
further. "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke, but I
hit EOF pretty fast; all the library had was a {JCL} manual." see also {EOL}.
