 :tentacle: /n./ A covert {pseudo}, sense 1. An artificial identity created
in cyberspace for nefarious and deceptive purposes. The implication is that a
single person may have multiple tentacles. This term was originally floated
in some paranoid ravings on the cypherpunks list (see {cypherpunk}), and
adopted in a spirit of irony by other, saner members. It has since shown up,
used seriously, in the documentation for some remailer software, and is now
(1994) widely recognized on the net.
