 :Random Number God: [rec.games.roguelike.angband; often abbreviated `RNG']
The malign force which lurks behind the random number generator in {Angband}
(and by extension elsewhere). A dark god that demands sacrifices and toys
with its victims. "I just found a really great item; I suppose the RNG is
about to punish me..." Apparently, Angband's random number generator
occasionally gets locked in a repetition, so you get something with a 3%
chance happening 8 times in a row. Improbable, but far too common to be pure
chance. Compare {Shub-Internet}.
