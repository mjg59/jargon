 FUDGE FACTOR (fuhj faktr) n. A value or parameter that is varied in an ad
hoc way to produce the desired result. The terms "tolerance" and "slop" are
also used, though these usually indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer
which is made larger than necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large
it needs to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to lose
completely for not having enough. A fudge factor, on the other hand, can
often be tweaked in more than one direction. An example might be the
coefficients of an equation, where the coefficients are varied in an attempt
to make the equation fit certain criteria.
