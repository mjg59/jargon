 :fudge factor: /n./ A value or parameter that is varied in an ad hoc way to
produce the desired result. The terms `tolerance' and {slop} are also used,
though these usually indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a buffer that is
made larger than necessary because one isn't sure exactly how large it needs
to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to lose completely for
not having enough. A fudge factor, on the other hand, can often be tweaked in
more than one direction. A good example is the `fuzz' typically allowed in
floating-point calculations: two numbers being compared for equality must be
allowed to differ by a small amount; if that amount is too small, a
computation may never terminate, while if it is too large, results will be
needlessly inaccurate. Fudge factors are frequently adjusted incorrectly by
programmers who don't fully understand their import. see also {coefficient of
X}.
