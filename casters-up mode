 :casters-up mode: [IBM, prob. fr. slang belly up] n. Yet another synonym for
`broken' or `down'. Usually connotes a major failure. A system (hardware or
software) which is `down' may be already being restarted before the failure
is noticed, whereas one which is `casters up' is usually a good excuse to
take the rest of the day off (as long as you're not responsible for fixing
it).
