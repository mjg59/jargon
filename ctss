 :CTSS: /C-T-S-S/ /n./ Compatible Time-Sharing System. An early (1963)
experiment in the design of interactive time-sharing operating systems,
ancestral to {{Multics}}, {{Unix}}, and {{ITS}}. The name {{ITS}}
(Incompatible Time-sharing System) was a hack on CTSS, meant both as a joke
and to express some basic differences in philosophy about the way I/O
services should be presented to user programs.
