 3. vt. [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand craft'] To write assembler code for
something normally (and better) done by a compiler (see {hand-hacking}). 4.
n. Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of redundant or superseded code. 5.
[University of Wisconsin] n. Cruft is to hackers as gaggle is to geese; that
is, at UW one properly says "a cruft of hackers". :cruft together: vt. (also
`cruft up') To throw together something ugly but temporarily workable. Like
vt. {kluge up}, but more pejorative. "There isn't any program now to reverse
all the lines of a file, but I can probably cruft one together in about 10
minutes." see {hack together}, {hack up}, {kluge up}, {crufty}.
:cruftsmanship: /kruhfts'm*n-ship / n. [from {cruft}] The antithesis of
craftsmanship. :crufty: /kruhf'tee/ adj. [very common; origin unknown; poss.
from `crusty' or `cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex. The
{canonical} example is "This is standard old crufty {DEC} software". In fact,
one fanciful theory of the origin of `crufty' holds that was originally a
mutation of `crusty' applied to DEC software so old that the `s' characters
were tall and skinny, looking more like `f' characters. 2. Unpleasant,
especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. Like spilled coffee
smeared with peanut butter and catsup. 3. Generally unpleasant. 4. (sometimes
spelled `cruftie') n. A small crufty object (see {frob}); often one that
doesn't fit well into the scheme of things. "A LISP property list is a good
place to store crufties (or, collectively, {random} cruft)." This term is one
of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of its etymology, but it is
suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at Harvard University which is part of
the old physics building; it's said to have been the physics department's
radar lab during WWII. To this day (early 1993) the windows appear to be full
of random techno-junk. MIT or Lincoln Labs people may well have coined the
term as a knock on the competition. :crumb: n. Two binary digits; a {quad}.
Larger than a {bit}, smaller than a {nybble}. Considered silly. Syn.
{tayste}. General discussion of such terms is under {nybble}. :crunch: 1. vi.
To process, usually in a time-consuming or complicated way. Connotes an
essentially trivial operation that is nonetheless painful to perform. The
pain may be due to the triviality's being embedded in a loop from 1 to
1,000,000,000. "FORTRAN programs do mostly {number-crunching}." 2. vt. To
reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as by a
Huffman code. (The file ends up looking something like a paper document would
if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.) Since such compression usually
takes more computations than simpler methods such as run-length encoding, the
term is doubly appropriate. (This meaning is usually used in the construction
`file crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from {number-crunching}.) see
{compress}. 3. n. The character `#'. Used at XEROX and CMU, among other
places. see {{ASCII}}. 4. vt. To squeeze program source into a minimum-size
representation that will still compile or execute. The term came into being
specifically for a famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source
in order to make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so
the number of characters mattered). {Obfuscated C Contest} entries are often
crunched; see the first example under that entry. :cryppie: /krip'ee/ n. A
cryptographer. One who hacks or implements cryptographic software or
hardware. :CTSS: /C-T-S-S/ n. Compatible Time-Sharing System. An early (1963)
experiment in the design of interactive time-sharing operating systems,
ancestral to {{Multics}}, {{Unix}}, and {{ITS}}. The name {{ITS}}
(Incompatible Time-sharing System) was a hack on CTSS, meant both as a joke
and to express some basic differences in philosophy about the way I/O
services should be presented to user programs. :cube: n. 1. [short for
`cubicle'] A module in the open-plan offices used at many programming shops.
"I've got the manuals in my cube." 2. A NeXT machine (which resembles a
matte-black cube). :cubing: vi. [parallel with `tubing'] 1. Hacking on an
IPSC (Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube. "Louella's gone cubing
_again_!!" 2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles, either physically or
mathematically. 3. An indescribable form of self-torture (see sense 1 or 2).
:cup holder: n. The tray of a CD-ROM drive, or by extension the
