 ORTHOGONAL (or-tho'guh-nl) [from mathematics] n. Mutually independent;
well-separated; sometimes, irrelevant to. Used to describe sets of primitives
or capabilities which, like a vector basis in geometry, span the entire
`capability space' of the system and are in some sense non-overlapping or
mutually independent. For example, in architectures such as the MC68000 where
all or nearly all registers can be used interchangeably in any role with
respect to any instruction, the register set is said to be orthogonal. Or, in
logic, the set of operators `not' and `or' is orthogonal, but the set `and',
`or' and `not' is not (because any one of these can be expressed in terms of
the other two via De Morgan's Laws).
