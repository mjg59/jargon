 :Death Square: n. The corporate logo of Novell, the people who acquired USL
after AT&T let go of it (Novell eventually sold the Unix group to SCO).
Coined by analogy with {Death Star}, because many people believed Novell was
bungling the lead in Unix systems exactly as AT&T did for many years. [They
were right --ESR]
