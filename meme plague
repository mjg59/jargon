 MEME PLAGUE n. The spread of a successful but pernicious MEME, esp. one
which `parasitizes' the victims into giving their all to propagate it.
Astrology, BASIC, and the other guy's religion are often considered to be
examples. This usage is given point by the historical fact that `joiner'
ideologies like Naziism or various forms of millenarian Christianity have
exhibited plague-like cycles of exponential growth followed by collapse to
small `reservoir' populations.
