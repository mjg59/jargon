 :meme plague: /n./ The spread of a successful but pernicious {meme}, esp.
one that parasitizes the victims into giving their all to propagate it.
Astrology, BASIC, and the other guy's religion are often considered to be
examples. This usage is given point by the historical fact that `joiner'
ideologies like Naziism or various forms of millennarian Christianity have
exhibited plague-like cycles of exponential growth followed by collapses to
small reservoir populations.
