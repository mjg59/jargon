 :random numbers:: /n./ When one wishes to specify a large but random number
of things, and the context is inappropriate for {N}, certain numbers are
preferred by hacker tradition (that is, easily recognized as placeholders).
These include the following: 17 Long described at MIT as `the least random
number'; see 23. 23 Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17
and 5). 42 The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and
Everything. (Note that this answer is completely fortuitous. `:-)') 69 From
the sexual act. This one was favored in MIT's ITS culture. 105 69 hex = 105
decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal. 666 The Number of the Beast. For further
enlightenment, study the "Principia Discordia", "{The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy}", "The Joy of Sex", and the Christian Bible (Revelation 13:18).
