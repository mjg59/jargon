 :EOU: /E-O-U/ n. The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control character (End Of
User) that could make an ASR-33 Teletype explode on receipt. This parodied
the numerous obscure delimiter and control characters left in ASCII from the
days when it was associated more with wire-service teletypes than computers
(e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. EOT). It is worth remembering
that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a lot of clattering
parts; the notion that one might explode was nowhere near as ridiculous as it
might seem to someone sitting in front of a {tube} or flatscreen today.
