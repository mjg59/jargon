 EOU /ee oh yoo/ The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control character (End Of
User) that could make a Model 33 Teletype explode on receipt. This parodied
the numerous obscure record-delimiter control characters left in ASCII from
the days when it was more associated with wire-service teletypes than
computers (e.g. FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX and esp. EOT). It is worth
remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a lot of
clattering parts; the notion that one might explode was nowhere near as
ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in front of a TUBE or
flatscreen today.
