 EOU: /ee-oh-yoo/ n. The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control character (End
Of User) that could make a Model 33 Teletype explode on receipt. This
parodied the numerous obscure delimiter and control characters left in ASCII
from the days when it was more associated with wire-service teletypes than
computers (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX and esp. EOT). It is worth
remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a lot of
clattering parts; the notion that one might explode was nowhere near as
ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in front of a {tube} or
flatscreen today. epoch: [UNIX] [perhaps from astronomical timekeeping] n.
The time and date corresponding to zero in an operating system's clock and
timestamp values. Under most UNIX versions, 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.
System time is measured in seconds or {tick}s past the epoch. Note that weird
problems may ensue when the clock wraps around (see {wrap around}), and that
this is not a necessarily a rare event; on systems counting 10 {tick}s per
second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is good only for 6.8 years. The
1-tick-per-second clock of UNIX is good only until January 18, 2038, assuming
word lengths don't increase by then. see {tick}s, {wall time}. epsilon: [see
{delta} for etymology] 1. n. A small quantity of anything. "The cost is
epsilon." 2. adj. Very small, negligible; less than {marginal}. "We can get
this feature for epsilon cost." 3. {within epsilon of}: close enough to be
indistinguishable for all practical purposes. This is even closer than being
`within delta of'. Example: "That's not what I asked for, but it's within
epsilon of what I wanted." Alternatively, it may mean not close enough, but
very little is required to get it there: "My program is within epsilon of
working." see {asymptotic}. epsilon squared: n. A quantity even smaller than
{epsilon}, as small in comparison to it as it is to something normal;
completely negligible. If you buy a supercomputer for a million dollars, the
cost of the thousand-dollar terminal to go with it is {epsilon}, and the cost
of the ten-dollar cable to connect the two is {epsilon squared}. era, the:
Syn. {epoch}. The Webster's Unabridged makes these words almost synonymous,
but `era' usually connotes a span of time rather than a point in time. The
{epoch} usage is recommended. Eric Conspiracy: n. A shadowy group of
mustachioed hackers named Eric first pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by
an infamous talk.bizarre posting c. 1986; this was doubtless influenced by
the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to
be considerably more mustachioed Erics in hackerdom than the frequency of
these three traits can account for unless they are correlated in some arcane
way. Well-known examples include Eric Allman of {BSD} fame, and Erik Fair
(co-author of NNTP); your editor has heard from about fourteen others by
email, and the organization line `Eric Conspiracy Secret Laboratories' now
emanates regularly from more than one site. Eris: /e'ris/ pn. The Greek
goddess of Chaos, Discord, Confusion, and Things You Know Not Of; her name
was latinized to Discordia and she was worshiped by that name in Rome. Not a
very friendly deity in the Classical original, she was re-invented as a more
benign personification of creative anarchy starting in 1959 by the adherents
of {Discordianism} and has since been a semi-serious subject of veneration in
several `fringe' cultures including hackerdom. see {Discordianism}, {Church
of the Sub-Genius}. erotics: /ee-ro'tiks/ n. Reported from Scandinavia as
English-language university slang for electronics. Often used by hackers,
maybe because good electronics makes them warm. essentials: n. Things
necessary to maintain a productive and secure hacking environment. "A jug of
wine, a loaf of bread, a 20-megahertz 80386 box with 8 meg of core and a
300-megabyte disk supporting full UNIX with source and X windows and EMACS
and UUCP via a 'blazer to a friendly Internet site, and thou." evil: adj. As
used by hackers, implies that some system, program, person, or institution is
sufficiently mal-designed as to be not worth the bother of dealing with.
Unlike the adjectives in the {cretinous}/{losing}/{brain-damaged} series,
`evil' does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of goals
or design criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's. This is more an
esthetic and engineering judgement than a moral one in the mainstream sense.
"We thought about adding a {Blue Glue} interface but decided it was too evil
to deal with." "{TECO} is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're prone to
typos." Often pronounced with the first syllable lengthened, as /eeee'vil/.
exa-: /ek's@/ pref. Multiplier, 10 ^ 18 or [proposed] 2 ^ 60. see {kilo-}.
examining the entrails: n. The process of rooting through a core dump or hex
image in the attempt to discover the bug that brought your program or system
down. Compare {runes}, {incantation}, {black art}, {desk check}.
