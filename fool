 :fool: /n./ As used by hackers, specifically describes a person who
habitually reasons from obviously or demonstrably incorrect premises and
cannot be persuaded by evidence to do otherwise; it is not generally used in
its other senses, i.e., to describe a person with a native incapacity to
reason correctly, or a clown. Indeed, in hackish experience many fools are
capable of reasoning all too effectively in executing their errors. see also
{cretin}, {loser}, {fool file, the}. The Algol 68-R compiler used to
initialize its storage to the character string "F00LF00LF00LF00L..." because
as a pointer or as a floating point number it caused a crash, and as an
integer or a character string it was very recognizable in a dump. Sadly, one
day a very senior professor at Nottingham University wrote a program that
called him a fool. He proceeded to demonstrate the correctness of this
assertion by lobbying the university (not quite successfully) to forbid the
use of Algol on its computers. see also {DEADBEEF}.
