 :fool: n. As used by hackers, specifically describes a person who habitually
reasons from obviously or demonstrably incorrect premises and cannot be
persuaded by evidence to do otherwise; it is not generally used in its other
senses, i.e., to describe a person with a native incapacity to reason
correctly, or a clown. Indeed, in hackish experience many fools are capable
of reasoning all too effectively in executing their errors. see also
{cretin}, {loser}, {fool file, the}.
