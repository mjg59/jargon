 GCOS: n. A quick and dirty {clone} of System/360 DOS that emerged from GE
about 1970; originally called GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive
Operating System) and later kluged to support primitive timesharing and
transaction processing. After the buyout of GE's computer division by
Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive Operating System
(GCOS). Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as `God's Chosen
Operating System', allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowd's uninformed and
snotty attitude about the superiority of their product. All this might be of
zero interest, except for two facts: 1. the GCOS people won the political
war, resulting in the orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell {Multics},
and 2. GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on UNIX. Some early UNIX systems at
Bell Labs were used as front ends to GCOS machines; the field added to
/etc/passwd to carry GCOS ID information was called the `GECOS field' and
survives today as the pw_gecos member used for the user's full name and other
human-id information. GCOS later played a major role in keeping Honeywell a
dismal also-ran in the mainframe market, and was itself ditched for UNIX in
the late 1980s when Honeywell retired its aging {big iron} designs.
