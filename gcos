 :GCOS:: /jee'kohs/ n. A {quick-and-dirty} {clone} of System/360 DOS that
emerged from GE around 1970; originally called GECOS (the General Electric
Comprehensive Operating System). Later kluged to support primitive
timesharing and transaction processing. After the buyout of GE's computer
division by Honeywell, the name was changed to General Comprehensive
Operating System (GCOS). Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it
as `God's Chosen Operating System', allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowd's
uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their product. All
this might be of zero interest, except for two facts: (1) The GCOS people won
the political war, and this led in the orphaning and eventual death of
Honeywell {{Multics}}, and (2) GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on Unix.
Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling
and various other services; the field added to `/etc/passwd' to carry GCOS ID
information was called the `GECOS field' and survives today as the `pw_gecos'
member used for the user's full name and other human-ID information. GCOS
later played a major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the
mainframe market, and was itself mostly ditched for Unix in the late 1980s
when Honeywell began to retire its aging {big iron} designs.
