 :elite: /adj./ Clueful. Plugged-in. One of the cognoscenti. Also used as a
general positive adjective. This term is not actually hacker slang in the
strict sense; it is used primarily by crackers and {warez d00dz}. Cracker
usage is probaby related to a 19200cps modem called the `Courier Elite' that
was widely popular on pirate boards before the V.32bis standard. A true
hacker would be more likely to use `wizardly'. Oppose {lamer}.
