 :fork: In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or
more) versions of a software package's source code are being developed in
parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple versions of
the source code have irreconcilable differences between them. This should not
be confused with a development branch, which may later be folded back into
the original source code base. Nor should it be confused with what happens
when a new distribution of Linux or some other distribution is created,
because that largely assembles pieces than can and will be used in other
distributions without conflict. Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so
uncommon that individual instances loom large in hacker folklore. Notable in
this class were the Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a
merger) and the forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating
systems.
