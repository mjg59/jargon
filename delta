 DELTA n. 1. A change, especially a small or incremental change. Example: "I
just doubled the speed of my program!" "What was the delta on program size?"
"About thirty percent." (He doubled the speed of his program, but increased
its size by only thirty percent.) 2. [UNIX] A DIFF (q.v.), especially a DIFF
stored under the set of version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code
Control System). 3. n. A small quantity, but not as small as EPSILON. The
slang usage of DELTA and EPSILON stems from the traditional use of these
letters in mathematics for very small numerical quantities, particularly in
so-called "epsilon-delta" proofs in the differential calculus. DELTA is often
used once EPSILON has been mentioned to mean a quantity that is slightly
bigger than EPSILON but still very small. For example, "The cost isn't
epsilon, but it's delta" means that the cost isn't totally negligible, but it
is nevertheless very small. Compare WITHIN DELTA OF, WITHIN EPSILON OF: that
is, close to and even closer to.
