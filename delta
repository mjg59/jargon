 :delta: n. 1. [techspeak] A quantitative change, especially a small or
incremental one (this use is general in physics and engineering). "I just
doubled the speed of my program!" "What was the delta on program size?"
"About 30 percent." (He doubled the speed of his program, but increased its
size by only 30 percent.) 2. [Unix] A {diff}, especially a {diff} stored
under the set of version-control tools called SCCS (Source Code Control
System) or RCS (Revision Control System). 3. n. A small quantity, but not as
small as {epsilon}. The jargon usage of {delta} and {epsilon} stems from the
traditional use of these letters in mathematics for very small numerical
quantities, particularly in `epsilon-delta' proofs in limit theory (as in the
differential calculus). The term {delta} is often used, once {epsilon} has
been mentioned, to mean a quantity that is slightly bigger than {epsilon} but
still very small. "The cost isn't epsilon, but it's delta" means that the
cost isn't totally negligible, but it is nevertheless very small. Common
constructions include `within delta of ---', `within epsilon of ---': that
is, `close to' and `even closer to'.
