 :lots of MIPS but no I/O: adj. Used to describe a person who is technically
brilliant but can't seem to communicate with human beings effectively.
Technically it describes a machine that has lots of processing power but is
bottlenecked on input-output (in 1991, the IBM Rios, a.k.a. RS/6000, is a
notorious recent example).
