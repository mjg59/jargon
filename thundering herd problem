 :thundering herd problem: Scheduler thrashing. This can happen under Unix
when you have a number of processes that are waiting on a single event. When
that event (a connection to the web server, say) happens, every process which
could possibly handle the event is awakened. In the end, only one of those
processes will actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime, all the
others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to sleep. Thus
the system thrashes briefly while a herd of processes thunders through. If
this starts to happen many times per second, the performance impact can be
significant.
