 AI koans: pl.n. A series of pastiches of Zen teaching riddles created by
Danny Hillis at the MIT AI Lab around various major figures of the Lab's
culture. A selection are included in Appendix A. see also {ha ha only
serious} and {{Humor, Hacker}}. AIDS: /aydz/ n. Short for A* Infected Disk
Syndrome ("A*" matches, but not limited to, Apple), this condition is the
quite often the result of practicing unsafe {SEX}. see {virus}, {worm},
{Trojan horse}, {virgin}. airplane rule: n. "Complexity increases the
possibility of failure; a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine
problems as a single engine airplane." By analogy, in both software and
electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness (see also {KISS
Principle}. It is correspondingly argued that the right way to build reliable
systems is to design to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure
that you've built a *really good* basket. aliasing bug: [C programmers] n. A
class of subtle programming errors which can arise in code that does dynamic
allocation, esp. via `malloc(3)'. If more than one pointer addresses
(`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may happen that the storage is
freed through one alias and then referenced through another, leading to
subtle (and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state and the
allocation history of the malloc {arena}. Avoidable by use of allocation
strategies that never alias allocated core. Also avoidable by use of
higher-level languages such as {LISP} which employ a garbage collector (see
{GC}). Also called a {stale pointer bug}. see also {precedence lossage},
{smash the stack}, {fandango on core}, {memory leak}, {overrun screw},
{spam}. all-elbows: adj. Of a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC
program, such as the N pop-up calendar and calculator utilities that
circulate on {BBS} systems: unsociable. Used to describe a program that
rudely steals the resources that it needs without considering that other TSRs
may also be resident. One particularly common form of rudeness is lock-up due
to programs fighting over the keyboard interrupt. see also {mess-doss}.
