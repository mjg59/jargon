 :click of death: n. A syndrome of certain Iomega ZIP drives, named for the
clicking noise that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after
accepting a disk, will start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the
disk. A common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of
a paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. "Clicked" disks are
generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive. The clicking noise
is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping against its movement stops
when it fails to find track 0 on the disk, causing the head to become
misaligned. This can happen when the drive has been subjected to a physical
shock, or when the disk is exposed to an electromagnetic field, such as that
of the CRT. Another common cause is when a package of disks is armed with an
anti-theft strip at a store. When the clerk scans the product to disarm the
strip, it can demagnetize the disks, wiping out track 0. There is evidence
that the click of death is a communicable disease; a "clicked" disk can cause
the read/write head of a "clean" drive to become misaligned. Iomega at first
denied the existence of the click of death, but eventually offered to replace
free of charge any drives affected by the condition.
