 JRN, JRL /jay ahr en/, /jay ahr el/ n. The names JRN and JRL were sometimes
used as example names when discussing PPNs (q.v.); they were understood to be
programmer names for (fictitious) programmers named "J. Random Nerd" and "J.
Random Loser" (see [J. RANDOM). For example, one might say "To log in, type
log one comma jay are en" (that is, "[log1,JRN]"), and the listener will
understand that he should use his own computer id in place of "[JRN]".
