 :nude: adj. Said of machines delivered without an operating system (compare
{bare metal}). "We ordered 50 systems, but they all arrived nude, so we had
to spend an extra weekend with the installation disks." This usage is a
recent innovation reflecting the fact that most IBM-PC clones are now
delivered with an operating system pre-installed at the factory. Other kinds
of hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so this term is
particular to PC support groups.
