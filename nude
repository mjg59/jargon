 :nude: adj. Said of machines delivered without an operating system (compare
{bare metal}). "We ordered 50 systems, but they all arrived nude, so we had
to spend a an extra weekend with the installation tapes." This usage is a
recent innovation reflecting the fact that most PC clones are now delivered
with DOS or Microsoft Windows pre-installed at the factory. Other kinds of
hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so this term is particular
to PC support groups.
