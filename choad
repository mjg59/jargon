 :choad: /chohd/ /n./ Synonym for `penis' used in alt.tasteless and
popularized by the denizens thereof. They say: "We think maybe it's from
Middle English but we're all too damned lazy to check the OED." [I'm not. It
isn't. -- ESR] This term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s
underground comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and
Butthead cartoons. A speaker of the Bengali language has alleged that `choad'
is in fact a Bengali word equivalent to `fuck'; it is therefore likely to
have entered English slang via the British Raj.
