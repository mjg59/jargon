 :blitter: /blit'r/ n. [common] A special-purpose chip or hardware system
built to perform {blit} operations, esp. used for fast implementation of
bit-mapped graphics. The Commodore Amiga and a few other micros have these,
but since 1990 the trend has been away from them (however, see {cycle of
reincarnation}). Syn. {raster blaster}.
