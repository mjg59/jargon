 :blitter: /blit'r/ n. A special-purpose chip or hardware system built to
perform {blit} operations, esp. used for fast implementation of bit-mapped
graphics. The Commodore Amiga and a few other micros have these, but in 1991
the trend is away from them (however, see {cycle of reincarnation}). Syn.
{raster blaster}.
