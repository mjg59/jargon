 :laser chicken: /n./ Kung Pao Chicken, a standard Chinese dish containing
chicken, peanuts, and hot red peppers in a spicy pepper-oil sauce. Many
hackers call it `laser chicken' for two reasons: It can {zap} you just like a
laser, and the sauce has a red color reminiscent of some laser beams. In a
variation on this theme, it is reported that some Australian hackers have
redesignated the common dish `lemon chicken' as `Chernobyl Chicken'. The name
is derived from the color of the sauce, which is considered bright enough to
glow in the dark (as, mythically, do some of the inhabitants of Chernobyl).
