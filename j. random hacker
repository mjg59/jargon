 :J. Random Hacker: /J rand´m hak´r/, n. [very common] A mythical figure like
the Unknown Soldier; the archetypal hacker nerd. This term is one of the
oldest in the jargon, apparently going back to MIT in the 1960s. see
{random}, {Suzie COBOL}. This may originally have been inspired by `J. Fred
Muggs', a show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a household word back in the
early days of {TMRC}, and was probably influenced by `J. Presper Eckert' (one
of the co-inventors of the electronic computer). see also {Fred Foobar}.
