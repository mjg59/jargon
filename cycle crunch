 CYCLE CRUNCH n. The situation where the number of people trying to use the
computer simultaneously has reached the point where no one can get enough
cycles because they are spread too thin. Usually the only solution is to buy
more computer. Happily, this has rapidly become easier in recent years, so
much so that the very term CYCLE CRUNCH now has a faintly archaic flavor
(most hackers now use workstations or personal computers as opposed to
traditional timesharing systems).
