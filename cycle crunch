 :cycle crunch: /n./ A situation wherein the number of people trying to use a
computer simultaneously has reached the point where no one can get enough
cycles because they are spread too thin and the system has probably begun to
{thrash}. This scenario is an inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to
timesharing. Usually the only solution is to buy more computer. Happily, this
has rapidly become easier since the mid-1980s, so much so that the very term
`cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic flavor; most hackers now use
workstations or personal computers as opposed to traditional timesharing
systems.
