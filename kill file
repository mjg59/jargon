 KILL FILE [USENET] n. Some USENET readers allow users to set filter patterns
against which news messages are compared, then ignored (not presented by the
reader) if the match succeeds. The file in which these patterns are stored is
called the user's kill file. Thus to "add a person (or subject) to one's kill
file" is to arrange for that person to be ignored by your newsreader in
future. By extension, it may be used for a decision to ignore the person or
subject in other media.
