 KILL FILE [USENET] n. Per-user file used by some USENET reading programs to
discard summarily (without presenting for reading) articles which match some
particularly uninteresting (or unwanted) patterns of subject, author, or
other header lines. Thus to "add a person (or subject) to one's kill file" is
to arrange for that person to be ignored by your newsreader in future. By
extension, it may be used for a decision to ignore the person or subject in
other media.
