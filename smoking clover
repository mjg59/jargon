 :smoking clover: n. [ITS] A {display hack} originally due to Bill Gosper.
Many convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in such a way that every
pixel struck has its color incremented. The lines all have one endpoint in
the middle of the screen; the other endpoints are spaced one pixel apart
around the perimeter of a large square. The color map is then repeatedly
rotated. This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering four-leaf
clover. Gosper joked about keeping it hidden from the FDA (the U.S.'s Food
and Drug Administration) lest its hallucinogenic properties cause it to be
banned.
