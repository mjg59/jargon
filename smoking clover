 SMOKING CLOVER [ITS] n. A DISPLAY HACK originally due to Bill Gosper. Many
convergent lines are drawn on a color monitor in AOS mode (so that every
pixel struck has its color incremented). The color map is then rotated. The
lines all have one endpoint in the middle of the screen; the other endpoints
are spaced one pixel apart around the perimeter of a large square. This
results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering four-leaf clover. Gosper
joked about keeping it hidden from the FDA lest it be banned.
