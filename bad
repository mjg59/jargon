 BAD: [IBM; acronym, Broken As Designed] adj. Said of a program which is
{bogus} due to bad design and misfeatures rather than due to bugginess. see
{working as designed}. Bad Thing: [from the 1962 Sellars & Yeatman parody
`1066 and All That'] n. Something which can't possibly result in improvement
of the subject. This term is always capitalized, as in "Replacing all of the
9600 baud modems with bicycle couriers would be a Bad Thing." Oppose {Good
Thing}. British correspondents confirm that {Bad Thing} and {Good Thing} (and
prob. therefore {Right Thing} and {Wrong Thing}) come from the book
referenced in the etymology, which discusses rulers who were Good Kings, but
Bad Things. This has apparently created a mainstream idiom on the British
side of the pond. bagbiter: /bag'biet-@r/ n. 1. Something, such as a program
or a computer, that fails to work, or works in a remarkably clumsy manner.
Example: "This text editor won't let me make a file with a line longer than
80 characters! What a bagbiter!" 2. A person who has caused you some trouble,
inadvertently or otherwise, typically by failing to program the computer
properly. Synonyms: {loser}, {cretin}, {chomper}. 3. adj. `bagbiting' Having
the quality of a bagbiter. "This bagbiting system won't let me compute the
factorial of a negative number." Compare {losing}, {cretinous},
{bletcherous}, `barfucious' (under {barfulous}) and `chomping' (under
{chomp}). 4. `bite the bag' vi. To fail in some manner. "The computer keeps
crashing every five minutes." "Yes, the disk controller is really biting the
bag." The original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly obscene,
possibly referring to the scrotum, but in their current usage they have
become almost completely sanitized. bamf: /bamf/ 1. [from old X-men comics]
interj. Notional sound made by a person or object teleporting in or out of
the hearer's vicinity. Often used in {virtual reality} (esp. {MUD})
electronic fora when a character wishes to make a dramatic entrance or exit.
2. The sound of magical transformation, used in vertual reality fora like
sense #1. 3. [from `Don Washington's Survival Guide'] n. Acronym for `Bad-Ass
Mother Fucker', used to refer to one of the handful of nastiest monsters on
an LPMUD or similar MUD. banana label: n. The labels often used on the sides
of {macrotape} reels, so called because they're shaped roughly like
blunt-ended bananas. This term, like macrotapes themselves, is still current
but visibly headed for obsolescence. banana problem: n. [from the story of
the little girl who said "I know how to spell `banana', but I don't know when
to stop"]. Not knowing where or when to bring a production to a close
(compare {fencepost error}). One may say there is a banana problem of an
algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect termination conditions, or in
discussing the evolution of a design that may be succumbing to featuritis
(see also {creeping elegance}, {creeping featuritis}). see also item 176
under {HAKMEM}. bandwidth: n. 1. Used by hackers in a generalization of its
technical meaning as the volume of information per unit time that a computer,
person or transmission medium can handle. "Those are amazing graphics but I
missed some of the detail --- not enough bandwidth, I guess." 2. Attention
span. 3. On {USENET}, a measure of network capacity that is often wasted by
people complaining about how network news items posted by others are a waste
of bandwidth. bang: 1. n. Common spoken name for `!' (ASCII 0100001),
especially when used in pronouncing a {bang path} in spoken hackish. In elder
days this was considered a CMUish usage, with MIT and Stanford hackers
preferring {excl} or {shriek}; but the spread of UNIX has carried {bang} with
it (esp. via the term {bang path}) and it is now certainly the most common
spoken name for `!'. Note that it is used exclusively for non-emphatic
written `!'; one would not say "Congratulations bang" (except possibly for
humorous purposes), but if one wanted to specify the exact characters `FOO!',
one would speak "Eff oh oh bang". see {shriek}, {{ASCII}}. 2. interj. An
exclamation signifying roughly "I have achieved enlightenment!", or "The
dynamite has cleared out my brain!". Often used to acknowledge that one has
perpetrated a {thinko} immediately after one has been called on it. bang
path: n. An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address specifying hops to get
from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee, so called because each
{hop} is signified by a {bang} sign. Thus the path
`...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me' directs correspondents to route their mail to
machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location accessible to everybody)
and from there through the machine `foovax' to the account of user `me' on
`barbox'. In the bad old days of not so long ago, before autorouting mailers
became commonplace, people often published compound bang addresses using the
{ } convention (see {glob}) to give paths from *several* big machines, in the
hopes that one's correspondent might be able to get mail to one of them
reliably (example: ...!{seismo, ut-sally, gatech}!rice!beta!gamma!me). Bang
paths of 8 to ten hops were not uncommon in 1981. Late night dial-up uucp
links would cause week-long transmission times. Bang paths were often
selected by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would often
get lost. see {{Internet address}}, {network, the}, and {sitename}. banner:
n. 1. The title page added to printouts by most print spoolers see {spool}.
Typically includes user or account ID information in very large
character-graphics capitals. 2. A similar printout generated (typically on
multiple pages of fan-fold paper) from user-specified text, e.g. by a program
such as UNIX's `banner([16])'. 3. On interactive software, a first screen
containing a logo and/or author credits and/or copyright notice. bar: /bar/
n. 1. The second metasyntactic variable, after {foo} and before {baz}.
"Suppose we have two functions FOO and BAR. FOO calls BAR...." 2. Often
appended to {foo} to produce {foobar}. bare metal: n. 1. New computer
hardware, unadorned with such snares and delusions as an {operating system},
{HLL}, or even assembler. Commonly in the phrase `programming on the bare
metal', which refers to the arduous work of {bit bashing} needed to create
these basic tools for a new machine. Real bare-metal programming involves
things like building boot proms and BIOS chips, implementing basic monitors
used to test device drivers, and writing the assemblers that will be used to
write the compiler back ends that will give the new machine a real
development environment. 2. The same phrase is also used to describe a style
of {hand-hacking} that relies on bit-level peculiarities of a particular
hardware design, esp. tricks for speed and space optimization that rely on
crocks such as overlapping opcodes (or, as in the famous case described in
Appendix A, interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch
delays due to the device's rotational latency). This sort of thing has become
less common as the relative costs of programming time and machine resources
have changed, but is still found in heavily constrained environments like
industrial embedded systems. see {real programmer}. barf: /barf/ [from
mainstream slang meaning `vomit'] 1. interj. Term of disgust. This is the
closest hackish equivalent of the Valspeak `gag me with a spoon' (Like,
euwww!). see {bletch}. 2. To say "Barf!" or emit some similar expression of
disgust. "I showed him my latest hack and he barfed" means only that he
complained about it, not that he literally vomited. 3. vi. To fail to work
because of unacceptable input. May mean to give an error message. Examples:
"The division operation barfs if you try to divide by zero." (that is,
division by zero fails in some unspecified spectacular way) "The text editor
barfs if you try to read in a new file before writing out the old one." see
{choke}, {gag}. Note that in Commonwealth hackish, `barf' is generally
replaced by `puke' or `vom'. {barf} is sometimes also used as a metasyntactic
variable like {foo} or {bar}. barfulation: interj. Variation of {barf} used
around the Stanford area. An exclamation, expressing disgust. On seeing some
particularly bad code one might exclaim, "Barfulation! Who wrote this, Quux?"
barfulous: adj. (also `barfucious') Said of something which would make anyone
barf, if only for esthetic reasons. baroque: adj. Feature-encrusted; complex;
gaudy; verging on excessive. Said of hardware or (esp.) software designs,
this has many of the connotations of {elephantine} or {monstrosity} but is
less extreme and not pejorative in itself. see also {rococo}. BartleMUD:
/bar'tl-muhd/ n. Any of the MUDs which are derived from the original MUD game
(see {MUD}) or use the same software drivers. BartleMUDs are noted for their
(usually slightly offbeat) humor, dry but friendly syntax, and lack of
adjectives in object descriptions, so a player is likely to come across
`brand172', for instance (see {brand brand brand}). Some mudders intensely
dislike Bartle and this term, preferring to speak of `MUD-1'. bat file:
[MS-DOS] n. Abbreviation for {batch file}, the MSDOS equivalent of the UNIX
shell script, derived from the .BAT extension required for the command
interpreter to find the batch file and execute it. batch: adj.
Non-interactive. Hackers use this somewhat more loosely than the traditional
technical definitions justify; in particular, switches on a normally
interactive program that prepare it to receive non-interactive conmmand input
are often referred to as `batch mode' switches. A `batch file' is a series of
instructions written to be handed to an interactive program running in batch
mode. bathtub curve: n. Common term for the curve (resembling an end-to-end
section of one of those claw-footed antique bathtubs) that describes the
expected failure rate of electronics with time: initially high, dropping to
near zero for most of the system's lifetime, then rising again as it `tires
out'. see also {burn-in period}, {infant mortality}. baud: /bawd/ [simplified
from its technical meaning] n. Bits per second. Hence kilobaud or Kbaud,
thousand bits per second. The technical meaning is `level transitions per
second'; this coincides with bps only for two-level modulation with no
framing or stop bits. Hackers are generally aware of these nuances but
blithely ignore them. baud barf: /bawd barf/ n. The garbage one gets on the
monitor when using a modem connection with some protocol setting (esp. line
speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice extension on the same
line, or when really bad line noise disrupts the connection. Baud barf is not
completely {random}, by the way; hackers with a lot of serial-line experience
can usually tell whether the device at the other end is expecting a higher or
lower speed than the terminal is set to. *Really* experienced ones can
identify particular speeds. baz: /baz/ n. [Stanford corruption of {bar}] 1.
The third metasyntactic variable, after {foo} and {bar} and before {quux}
(or, occasionally, `qux'). "Suppose we have three functions FOO, BAR, and
BAZ. FOO calls BAR, which calls BAZ...." 2. interj. A term of mild annoyance.
In this usage the term is often drawn out for two or three seconds, producing
an effect not unlike the bleating of a sheep; /baaaaaaz/. 3. Occasionally
appended to {foo} to produce `foobaz'. bboard: /bee'bord/ [contraction of
`bulletin board'] n. 1. Any electronic bulletin board; esp. used of {BBS}
systems running on personal micros, less frequently of a USENET {newsgroup}
(in fact, use of the term for a newsgroup is generally marks one as a
{newbie}). 2. At CMU and other colleges with similar facilities, refers to
campuswide electronic bulletin boards. 3. The term `physical bboard' is
sometimes used to refer to a non-electronic old-fashioned cork memo board. At
CMU, it refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge. In either of senses
1 or 2, the term is usually prefixed by the name of the intended board (`the
Moonlight Casino bboard' or `market bboard'); however, if the context is
clear, the better-read bboards may be referred to by name alone, as in [at
CMU] "Don't post for-sale ads on general".
