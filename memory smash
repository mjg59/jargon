 :memory smash: /n./ [XEROX PARC] Writing through a pointer that doesn't
point to what you think it does. This occasionally reduces your machine to a
rubble of bits. Note that this is subtly different from (and more general
than) related terms such as a {memory leak} or {fandango on core} because it
doesn't imply an allocation error or overrun condition.
