 :dink: /dink/ adj. Said of a machine that has the {bitty box} nature; a
machine too small to be worth bothering with --- sometimes the system you're
currently forced to work on. First heard from an MIT hacker working on a CP/M
system with 64K, in reference to any 6502 system, then from fans of 32-bit
architectures about 16-bit machines. "GNUMACS will never work on that dink
machine." Probably derived from mainstream `dinky', which isn't sufficiently
pejorative. see {macdink}.
