 :control-S: vi. "Stop talking for a second." From the ASCII DC3 or XOFF
character (the pronunciation /X-of/ is therefore also used). Control-S
differs from {control-O} in that the person is asked to stop talking (perhaps
because you are on the phone) but will be allowed to continue when you're
ready to listen to him -- as opposed to control-O, which has more of the
meaning of "Shut up." Considered silly.
