 :jello: n. [Usenet: by analogy with {spam}] A message that is both
excessively cross-posted and too frequently posted, as opposed to {spam}
(which is merely too frequently posted) or {velveeta} (which is merely
excessively cross-posted). This term is widely recognized but not commonly
used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse or their combination as spam.
