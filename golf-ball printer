 :golf-ball printer: n. The IBM 2741, a slow but letter-quality printing
device and terminal based on the IBM Selectric typewriter. The `golf ball'
was a round object bearing reversed embossed images of 88 different
characters arranged on four meridians of latitude; one could change the font
by swapping in a different golf ball. This was the technology that enabled
APL to use a non-EBCDIC, non-ASCII, and in fact completely non-standard
character set. This put it 10 years ahead of its time --- where it stayed,
firmly rooted, for the next 20, until character displays gave way to
programmable bit-mapped devices with the flexibility to support other
character sets.
