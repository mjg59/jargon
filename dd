 :dd: /dee-dee/ [UNIX: from IBM {JCL}] vt. Equivalent to {cat} or {BLT}. This
was originally the name of a UNIX copy command with special options suitable
for block-oriented devices. Often used in heavy-handed system maintenance, as
in "Let's `dd' the root partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to load
it back on to a new disk". The UNIX `dd(1)' was designed with a weird,
distinctly non-UNIXy keyword option syntax reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL
(which had an elaborate DD `Data Definition' specification for I/O devices);
though the command filled a need, the interface design was clearly a prank.
The jargon usage is now very rare outside UNIX sites and now nearly obsolete
even there, as `dd(1)' has been {deprecated} for a long time (though it has
no exact replacement). Replaced by {BLT} or simple English `copy'.
