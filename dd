 :dd: /dee-dee/ vt. [Unix: from IBM {JCL}] Equivalent to {cat} or {BLT}.
Originally the name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable for
block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system maintenance,
as in "Let's `dd' the root partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to
load it back on to a new disk". The Unix `dd(1)' was designed with a weird,
distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL
(which had an elaborate DD `Dataset Definition' specification for I/O
devices); though the command filled a need, the interface design was clearly
a prank. The jargon usage is now very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly
obsolete even there, as `dd(1)' has been {deprecated} for a long time (though
it has no exact replacement). The term has been displaced by {BLT} or simple
English `copy'.
