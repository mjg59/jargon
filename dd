 DD /dee-dee/ [from IBM JCL via archaic UNIX dd(1)] vt. Equivalent to CAT or
BLT. A specialized UNIX copy command for block-oriented devices. Often used
in heavy-handed system abuse, as in "Let's dd the root partition onto a tape,
then use the boot prom to load it back on to a new disk". The UNIX dd(1) was
originally written with a weird, distinctly non-UNIXy keyword option syntax
reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had a similar DD command); though
the command filled a need the design choice looks to have been somebody's
joke. The slang usage is now very rare outside UNIX sites and now nearly
obsolescent even there, as dd(1) has been DEPRECATED for a long time (though
it has no replacement). Replaced by BLT or simple English `copy'.
