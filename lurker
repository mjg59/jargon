 :lurker: n. One of the `silent majority' in a electronic forum; one who
posts occasionally or not at all but is known to read the group's postings
regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed is casually used
reflexively: "Oh, I'm just lurking." Often used in `the lurkers', the
hypothetical audience for the group's {flamage}-emitting regulars.
