 :lurker: n. One of the `silent majority' in an electronic forum; one who
posts occasionally or not at all but is known to read the group's postings
regularly. This term is not pejorative and indeed is casually used
reflexively: "Oh, I'm just lurking." Often used in the lurkers, the
hypothetical audience for the group's {flamage}-emitting regulars. When a
lurker speaks up for the first time, this is called delurking. The creator of
the popular science-fiction TV series Babylon 5 has ties to SF fandom and the
hacker culture. In that series, the use of the term `lurker' for a homeless
or displaced person is a conscious reference to the jargon term.
