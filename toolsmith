 :toolsmith: n. The software equivalent of a tool-and-die specialist; one who
specializes in making the {tool}s with which other programmers create
applications. Many hackers consider this more fun than applications per se;
to understand why, see {uninteresting}. Jon Bentley, in the "Bumper-Sticker
Computer Science" chapter of his book "More Programming Pearls", quotes Dick
Sites from {DEC} as saying "I'd rather write programs to write programs than
write programs".
