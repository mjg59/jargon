 EVIL adj. As used by hackers, implies that some system, program, person or
institution is sufficiently mal-designed as to be not worth the bother of
dealing with. Unlike the adjectives in the CRETINOUS/LOSING/BRAIN-DAMAGED
series, EVIL does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of
goals or design criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's. This is
more an esthetic and engineering judgement than a moral one in the mainstream
sense. "We thought about adding a BLUE GLUE interface but decided it was too
evil to deal with." "TECO is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're prone
to typos." Often pronounced with the first syllable lengthened, as /eeeevil/.
