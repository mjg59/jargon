 :evil: /adj./ As used by hackers, implies that some system, program, person,
or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to be not worth the bother of
dealing with. Unlike the adjectives in the
{cretinous}/{losing}/{brain-damaged} series, `evil' does not imply
incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of goals or design criteria
fatally incompatible with the speaker's. This usage is more an esthetic and
engineering judgment than a moral one in the mainstream sense. "We thought
about adding a {Blue Glue} interface but decided it was too evil to deal
with." "{TECO} is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're prone to typos."
Often pronounced with the first syllable lengthened, as /eeee'vil/. Compare
{evil and rude}.
