 :print: v. To output, even if to a screen. If a hacker says that a program
"printed a message", he means this; if he refers to printing a file, he
probably means it in the conventional sense of writing to a hardcopy device
(compounds like `print job' and `printout', on the other hand, always refer
to the latter). This very common term is likely a holdover from the days when
printing terminals were the norm, perpetuated by programming language
constructs like {C}'s printf(3). see senses 1 and 2 of {tty}.
