 :juggling eggs: vi. Keeping a lot of {state} in your head while modifying a
program. "Don't bother me now, I'm juggling eggs", means that an interrupt is
likely to result in the program's being scrambled. In the classic 1975
first-contact SF novel The Mote in God's Eye, by Larry Niven and Jerry
Pournelle, an alien describes a very difficult task by saying "We juggle
priceless eggs in variable gravity." It is possible that this was intended as
tribute to a less colorful use of the same image in Robert Heinlein's
influential 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land. see also {hack mode} and
{on the gripping hand}.
