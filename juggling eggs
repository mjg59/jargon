 :juggling eggs: vi. Keeping a lot of {state} in your head while modifying a
program. "Don't bother me now, I'm juggling eggs", means that an interrupt is
likely to result in the program's being scrambled. In the classic
first-contact SF novel `The Mote in God's Eye', by Larry Niven and Jerry
Pournelle, an alien describes a very difficult task by saying "We juggle
priceless eggs in variable gravity." That is a very hackish use of language.
