 :condom: n. 1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies 3.5-inch
microfloppy diskettes. Rarely, also used of (paper) disk envelopes. Unlike
the write protect tab, the condom (when left on) not only impedes the
practice of {SEX} but has also been shown to have a high failure rate as
drive mechanisms attempt to access the disk -- and can even fatally frustrate
insertion. 2. The protective cladding on a {light pipe}. 3. `keyboard
condom': A flexible, transparent plastic cover for a keyboard, designed to
provide some protection against dust and {programming fluid} without impeding
typing. 4. `elephant condom': the plastic shipping bags used inside cardboard
boxes to protect hardware in transit. 5. n. obs. A dummy directory
`/usr/tmp/sh', created to foil the {Great Worm} by exploiting a portability
bug in one of its parts. So named in the title of a comp.risks article by
Gene Spafford during the Worm crisis, and again in the text of "The Internet
Worm Program: An Analysis", Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR-823.
