 :condom: n. 1. The protective plastic bag that accompanies 3.5-inch
microfloppy diskettes. Rarely, also used of (paper) disk envelopes. Unlike
the write protect tab, the condom (when left on) not only impedes the
practice of {SEX} but has also been shown to have a high failure rate as
drive mechanisms attempt to access the disk --- and can even fatally
frustrate insertion. 2. The protective cladding on a {light pipe}. 3.
`keyboard condom': A flexible, transparent plastic cover for a keyboard,
designed to provide some protection against dust and {programming fluid}
without impeding typing.
