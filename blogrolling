 :blogrolling: [From the American political term `logrolling', for supporting
another's pet bill in the legislature in exchange for reciprocal support,]
When you hotlink to other bloggers' blogs (and-or other bloggers' specific
blog entries) in your blog, you are blogrolling. This is frequently
reciprocal.
