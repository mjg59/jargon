 CYCLE n. The "basic unit of computation". What every hacker wants more of.
One might think that single machine instructions would be the measure of
computation, and indeed computers are often compared by how many instructions
they can process per second, but some instructions take longer than others.
Nearly all computers have an internal clock, though, and you can describe an
instruction as taking so many "clock cycles". Frequently the computer can
access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of
"memory cycles". These are technical meanings of "cycle". The slang meaning
comes from the observation that there are only so many cycles per second, and
when you are sharing a computer, the cycles get divided up among the users.
The more cycles the computer spends working on your program rather than
someone else's, the faster your program will run. That's why every hacker
wants more cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
respond.
