 :foo: /foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust. 2. Used very generally as a sample
name for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp. scratch files).
3. First on the standard list of {metasyntactic variable}s used in syntax
examples. see also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux}, {corge}, {grault}, {garply},
{waldo}, {fred}, {plugh}, {xyzzy}, {thud}. The etymology of hackish `foo' is
obscure. When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the
WWII-era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later
bowdlerized to {foobar}. (see also {FUBAR}). However, the use of the word
`foo' itself has more complicated antecedents, including a long history in
comic strips and cartoons. The old "Smokey Stover" comic strips by Bill
Holman often included the word `FOO', in particular on license plates of
cars; allegedly, `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips.
In the 1938 cartoon "The Daffy Doc", a very early version of Daffy Duck holds
up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!"; oddly, this seems to refer to some
approving or positive affirmative use of foo. It has been suggested that this
might be related to the Chinese word `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'),
which can mean "happiness" when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog
guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called
"fu dogs"). Paul Dickson's excellent book "Words" (Dell, 1982, ISBN
0-440-52260-7) traces "Foo" to an unspecified British naval magazine in 1946,
quoting as follows: "Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted
with bitter omniscience and sarcasm." Other sources confirm that `FOO' was a
semi-legendary subject of WWWII British-army grafitti more-or-less equivalent
to the American Kilroy. Where British troops went, the grafitti "FOO was
here" or something similar showed up. Several slang dictionaries aver that
FOO probably came from Forward Observation Officer. In this connection, the
later American military slang `foo fighters' is interesting; at least as far
back as the 1950s, radar operators used it for the kind of mysterious or
spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced in
popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better grunge-rock
bands). Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker
usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody", the title of a comic
book first issued in September 1958, a joint project of Charles and Robert
Crumb. Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens) later became one of the
most important and influential artists in underground comics, this venture
was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing
copies in disgust. The title FOO was featured in large letters on the front
cover. However, very few copies of this comic actually circulated, and
students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established that this title was a reference
to the earlier Smokey Stover comics. An old-time member reports that in the
1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language", compiled at {TMRC}, there was an
entry that went something like this: FOO: The first syllable of the sacred
chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME HUM." Our first obligation is to keep the foo
counters turning. For more about the legendary foo counters, see {TMRC}.
Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI LAB was involved with
TMRC, and probably picked the word up there. Very probably, hackish `foo' had
no single origin and derives through all these channels from Yiddish `feh'
and/or English `fooey'.
