 :foo: /foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust. 2. Used very generally as a sample
name for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp. scratch files).
3. First on the standard list of {metasyntactic variable}s used in syntax
examples. see also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux}, {corge}, {grault}, {garply},
{waldo}, {fred}, {plugh}, {xyzzy}, {thud}. The etymology of hackish `foo' is
obscure. When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the
WWII-era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later
bowdlerized to {foobar}. (see also {FUBAR}). However, the use of the word
`foo' itself has more complicated antecedents, including a long history in
comic strips and cartoons. The old "Smokey Stover" comic strips by Bill
Holman often included the word `FOO', in particular on license plates of
cars; allegedly, `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips.
In the 1938 cartoon "The Daffy Doc", a very early version of Daffy Duck holds
up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!"; oddly, this seems to refer to some
approving or positive affirmative use of foo. It has been suggested that this
might be related to the Chinese word `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'),
which can mean "happiness" when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog
guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called
"fu dogs"). Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that
hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody", the title of a
comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project of Charles and
Robert Crumb. Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens) later became one of
the most important and influential artists in underground comics, this
venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the
existing copies in disgust. The title FOO was featured in large letters on
the front cover. However, very few copies of this comic actually circulated,
and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established that this title was a
reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics. An old-time member reports
that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language", compiled at {TMRC} there
was an entry that went something like this: FOO: The first syllable of the
sacred chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME HUM." Our first obligation is to keep the
foo counters turning. For more about the legendary foo counters, see {TMRC}.
Almost the entire staff of what became the MIT AI LAB was involved with TMRC,
and probably picked the word up there. Very probably, hackish `foo' had no
single origin and derives through all these channels from Yiddish `feh'
and/or English `fooey'.
