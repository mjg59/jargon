 490501 characters, and 1046 entries. Version 2.3.1, Jan 03 1991: the great
format change --- case is no longer smashed in lexicon keys and
cross-references. A very few entries from jargon-1 which were basically
straight techspeak were deleted; this enabled the rest of Appendix B to be
merged back into main text and the appendix replaced with the Portrait of J.
Random Hacker. More USENET submissions were added. This version had 10728
lines, 85070 words, 558261 characters, and 1138 entries. Version 2.4.1, Jan
14 1991: the Story of Mel and many more USENET submissions merged in. More
material on hackish writing habits added. Numerous typo fixes. This version
had 12362 lines, 97819 words, 642899 characters, and 1239 entries. Version
2.5.1, Jan 29 1991: many new entries merged in. Discussion of inclusion
styles added. This version had 14145 lines, 111904 words, 734285 characters,
and 1425 entries. Version 2.6.1, Feb 13 1991: second great format change; no
more <> around headwords or references. Merged in results of serious
copy-editing passes by Guy Steele, Mark Brader. Still more entries added.
This version had 15011 lines, 118277 words, 774942 characters, and 1485
entries. Version 2.7.1, Mar 1 1991: new section on slang/jargon/techspeak
added. Results of Guy's 2nd edit pass merged in. This version had 16087
lines, 126885 words, 831872 characters, and 1533 entries. Version 2.8.1, Mar
22 1991: material from the TMRC Dictionary and MRC's editing pass merged in.
This version had 17154 lines, 135647 words, 888333 characters, and 1602
entries. Version numbering: Read versions as major.minor.revision. Major
version 1 is reserved for the `old' (ITS) Jargon File, jargon-1. Major
version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR (Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from
GLS (Guy L. Steele). Someday, the next maintainer will take over and spawn
`version 3'. Usually later versions will either completely supersede or
incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no point in keeping old
versions around. Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and
assistance, and to the hundreds of USENETters (too many to name here) who
contributed entries and encouragement. More thanks go to several of the
old-timers on the USENET group alt.folklore.computers, who contributed much
useful commentary and many corrections and valuable historical perspective:
Joseph M. Newcomer <jn11+@andrew.cmu.edu>, Bernie Cosell <cosell@bbn.com>,
Earl Boebert <boebert@SCTC.com>, and Joe Morris <jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org>.
We were fortunate enough to have the aid of several accomplished linguists.
David Stampe and Charles Hoequist contributed valuable criticism; Joe Keane
<jkg@osc.osc.com> helped us improve the pronunciation guides. A few bits of
this text quote previous works. We are indebted to Brian A. LaMacchia
<bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu> for obtaining permission for us to use material from
the `TMRC Dictionary'; also, Don Libes contributed some appropriate material
from his excellent book `Life With UNIX'. Scandinavian correspondent Per
Lindberg (per@front.se), author of the remarkable Swedish language 'zine
`Hackerbladet', for bringing FOO! comics to our attention and smuggling one
of the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon files out to us. Thanks also
to Maarten Litmaath for generously allowing the inclusion of the ASCII
pronunciation guide he formerly maintained. Finally, Mark Brader (msb@sq.com)
submitted many thoughtful comments and did yeoman service in catching typos
and minor usage bobbles, and Eric Tiedemann (est@thyrsus.com) contributed
sage advice on rhetoric, amphigory, and philosophunculism. Format For New
Entries ====================== Try to conform to the format already being
used --- head-words separated from text by a colon (double colon for topic
entries), cross-references in curly brackets (doubled for topic entries),
pronunciations in slashes, etymologies in square brackets, single-space after
definition numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the standard ASCII
character set (7-bit printable, no high-half characters or
[nt]roff/TeX/Scribe escapes), as one of the versions generated from the
master file is an info document that has to be viewable on a character tty.
We are looking to expand the file's range of technical specialties covered.
There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the scientific
computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in numerical
analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language design, and many
other related fields. Send us your jargon! We are *not* interested in
straight technical terms explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries
unless an entry illuminates `underground' meanings or aspects not covered by
official histories. We are also not interested in `joke' entries --- there is
a lot of humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations
of what hackers do and how they think. It is OK to submit items of jargon you
have originated if they have spread to the point of being used by people who
are not personally acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by
independent submission from two different sites.
