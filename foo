 :foo: /foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust. 2. [very common] Used very generally
as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp.
scratch files). 3. First on the standard list of {metasyntactic variable}s
used in syntax examples. see also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux}, {corge},
{grault}, {garply}, {waldo}, {fred}, {plugh}, {xyzzy}, {thud}. When `foo' is
used in connection with `bar' it has generally traced to the WWII-era Army
slang acronym {FUBAR} (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later modified to
{foobar}. Early versions of the Jargon File interpreted this change as a
post-war bowdlerization, but it it now seems more likely that FUBAR was
itself a derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German `furchtbar'
(terrible) - `foobar' may actually have been the _original_ form. For, it
seems, the word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar history in comic strips
and cartoons. The earliest documented uses were in the "Smokey Stover" comic
strip published from about 1930 to about 1952. Bill Holman, the author of the
strip, filled it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other
nonsense phrases such as "Notary Sojac" and "1506 nix nix". The word "foo"
frequently appeared in the on license plates of cars, in nonsens sayings in
the background of some frames (such as "He who foos last foos best" or "Many
smoke but foo men chew"), and Holman had Smokey say "Where there's foo,
there's fire". According to the Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion
(http://www.spumco.com/magazine/eowbcc/) Holman claimed to have found the
word "foo" on the bottom of a Chinese figurine. This is plausible; Chinese
statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this may have been the
Chinese word `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'), which can mean
"happiness" or "prosperity" when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog
guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called
"fu dogs"). English speakers' reception of Holman's `foo' nonsense word was
undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish `feh' and English `fooey' and `fool'.
Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on two
wheels. The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s, and
legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable
version of Holman's Foomobile. According to the Encyclopedia of American
Comics, `Foo' fever swept the U.S., finding its way into popular songs and
generating over 500 `Foo Clubs.' The fad left `foo' references embedded in
popular culture (including a couple of appearances in Warner Brothers
cartoons of 1938-39; notably in Robert Clampett's "Daffy Doc" of 1938, in
which a very early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS
FOO!")When the fad faded, the origin of "foo" was forgotten. One place "foo"
is known to have remained live is in the U.S. military during the WWII years.
In 1944-45, the term `foo fighters' was in use by radar operators for the
kind of mysterious or spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the
older term resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one
of the better grunge-rock bands). Because informants connected the term
directly to the Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that connects it to
French "feu" (fire) can be gently dismissed. The U.S. and British militaries
frequently swapped slang terms during the war (see {kluge} and {kludge} for
another important example) Period sources reported that `FOO' became a
semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army graffiti more or less equivalent
to the American Kilroy. Where British troops went, the graffito "FOO was
here" or something similar showed up. Several slang dictionaries aver that
FOO probably came from Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the
contemporaneous "FUBAR") was probably a {backronym} . Forty years later, Paul
Dickson's excellent book "Words" (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced
"Foo" to an unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:
"Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter
omniscience and sarcasm." Earlier versions of this entry suggested the
possibility that hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and
Parody", the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint
project of Charles and Robert Crumb. Though Robert Crumb (then in his
mid-teens) later became one of the most important and influential artists in
underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers
later burned most of the existing copies in disgust. The title FOO was
featured in large letters on the front cover. However, very few copies of
this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have
established that this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover
comics. The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived Canadian
parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52. An old-time member reports
that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language", compiled at {TMRC}, there
was an entry that went something like this: FOO: The first syllable of the
sacred chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME HUM." Our first obligation is to keep the
foo counters turning. (For more about the legendary foo counters, see
{TMRC}.) This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense word, only then two
decades old and demonstrably still live in popular culture and slang, to a
{ha ha only serious} analogy with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism. Today's hackers
would find it difficult to resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not
likely 1959's were any less susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what
later became the MIT AI Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from
there. Finally (and perhaps irrelevantly) a Russian correspondent reports
that in mainstream Russian, "Foo" (or "Fu") is an interjection commonly used
as a response to bad smell, bad taste, or other unpleasant sensatiion.
