 FOO (foo) 1. [from Yiddish "feh" or the Anglo-Saxon "fooey!"] interj. Term
of disgust. 2. [from FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition), from WWII,
often seen as FOOBAR] Name used for temporary programs, or samples of
three-letter names. Other similar words are BAR, BAZ (Stanford corruption of
BAR), and rarely RAG. These have been used in Pogo as well. 3. Used very
generally as a sample name for absolutely anything. The old `Smokey Stover'
comic strips often included the word FOO, in particular on license plates of
cars. 4. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in syntax
examples. see also: BAR, BAZ, QUX, QUUX, QUUUX, CORGE, GRAULT, GARPLY, WALDO,
FRED, PLUGH, XYZZY. MOBY FOO: see MOBY. [It is possible that hacker usage of
FOO actually springs from the title "FOO, Lampoons and Parody" of a comic
book first issued in September 1958; the byline read "C. Crumb" but my source
believes this was a sort-of pseudonym for noted weird-comix artist Robert
Crumb. The title FOO was featured in large letters on the front cover -- ESR]
