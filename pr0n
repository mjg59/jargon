 :pr0n: // [Usenet, IRC] Pornography. Originally this referred only to
Internet porn but since then it has expanded to refer to just about any kind.
The term comes from the {warez kiddies} tendency to replace letters with
numbers. At some point on IRC someone mistyped, swapped the middle two
letters, and the name stuck, then propagated over into mainstream hacker
usage. New versions of the Mozilla web browser internally refer to the image
library as "libpr0n"Compare {filk}, {grilf}, {hing} and {newsfroup}.
