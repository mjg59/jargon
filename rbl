 :RBL: /R-B-L/ Abbreviation: "Realtime Blackhole List". A service that allows
people to blacklist sites for emitting {spam}, and makes the blacklist
available in real time to electronic-mail transport programs that know how to
use RBL so they can filter out mail from those sites. Drastic (and
controversial) but effective. There is an RBL home page
(http://maps.vix.com/rbl/usage.html).
