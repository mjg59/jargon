 :gang bang: n. The use of large numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an
attempt to wedge a great many features into a product in a short time. Though
there have been memorable gang bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler
port mentioned in Steven Levy's `Hackers'), most are perpetrated by large
companies trying to meet deadlines and produce enormous buggy masses of code
entirely lacking in {orthogonal}ity. When market-driven managers make a list
of all the features the competition has and assign one programmer to
implement each, they often miss the importance of maintaining a coherent
design. see also {firefighting}, {Mongolian Hordes technique}, {Conway's
Law}.
