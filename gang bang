 :gang bang: n. The use of large numbers of loosely coupled programmers in an
attempt to wedge a great many features into a product in a short time. Though
there have been memorable gang bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler
port mentioned in Steven Levy's "Hackers"), and large numbers of
loosely-coupled programmers operating in {bazaar} mode can do very useful
work when they're not on a deadline, most are perpetrated by large companies
trying to meet unrealistic deadlines; the inevitable result is enormous buggy
masses of code entirely lacking in {orthogonal}ity. When market-driven
managers make a list of all the features the competition has and assign one
programmer to implement each, the probability of maintaining a coherent (or
even functional) design goes to {epsilon}. see also {firefighting},
{Mongolian Hordes technique}, {Conway's Law}.
