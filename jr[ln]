 :JR[LN]: /J-R-L/, /J-R-N/ n. The names JRL and JRN were sometimes used as
example names when discussing a kind of user ID used under {{TOPS-10}} and
{WAITS}; they were understood to be the initials of (fictitious) programmers
named `J. Random Loser' and `J. Random Nerd' (see {J. Random}). For example,
if one said "To log in, type log one comma jay are en" (that is, "log
1,JRN"), the listener would have understood that he should use his own
computer ID in place of `JRN'.
