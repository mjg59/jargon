 :h: [from SF fandom] infix. A method of `marking' common words, i.e.,
calling attention to the fact that they are being used in a nonstandard,
ironic, or humorous way. Originated in the fannish catchphrase "Bheer is the
One True Ghod!" from decades ago. H-infix marking of `Ghod' and other words
spread into the 1960s counterculture via underground comix, and into early
hackerdom either from the counterculture or from SF fandom (the three
overlapped heavily at the time). More recently, the h infix has become an
expected feature of benchmark names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone, etc.); this is
prob. patterning on the original Whetstone (the name of a laboratory) but
influenced by the fannish/counterculture h infix.
