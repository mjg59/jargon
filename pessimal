 PESSIMAL /pes'i-ml/ [Latin-based antonym for "optimal"] adj. Maximally bad.
"This is a pessimal situation." Also PESSIMIZE v. to make as bad as possible.
These words are the obvious Latin-based antonyms for "optimal" and
"optimize", but for some reason they do not appear in most English
dictionaries, although "pessimize" is listed in the Oxford English
Dictionary.
