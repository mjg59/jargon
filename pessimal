 :pessimal: /pes'im-l/ [Latin-based antonym for `optimal'] adj. Maximally
bad. "This is a pessimal situation." Also `pessimize' vt. To make as bad as
possible. These words are the obvious Latin-based antonyms for `optimal' and
`optimize', but for some reason they do not appear in most English
dictionaries, although `pessimize' is listed in the OED.
