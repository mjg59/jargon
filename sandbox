 :sandbox: n. 1. (also `sandbox, the') 1. Common term for the R&D department
at many software and computer companies (where hackers in commercial
environments are likely to be found). Half-derisive, but reflects the truth
that research is a form of creative play. Compare {playpen}. 2. Syn. {link
farm}. 3. A controlled environment within which potentially dangerous
programs are run. Used esp. in reference to Java implementations. 4. A
checked-out copy of a source tree, on which one may safely perform builds
without interfereing with others.
