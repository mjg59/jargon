 :washing machine: n. Old-style 14-inch hard disks in floor-standing
cabinets. So called because of the size of the cabinet and the `top-loading'
access to the media packs -- and, of course, they were always set on `spin
cycle'. The washing-machine idiom transcends language barriers; it is even
used in Russian hacker jargon. see also {walking drives}. The thick channel
cables connecting these were called `bit hoses' (see {hose}, sense 3).
