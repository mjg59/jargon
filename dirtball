 :dirtball: [XEROX PARC] n. A small, perhaps struggling outsider; not in the
major or even the minor leagues. For example, "Xerox is not a dirtball
company". [Outsiders often observe in the PARC culture an institutional
arrogance which usage of this term exemplifies. The brilliance and scope of
PARC's contributions to computer science have been such that this superior
attitude is not much resented. --- ESR]
