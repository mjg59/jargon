 SNAFU principle: [from WWII army acronym for "Situation Normal, all Fucked
Up"] n. "True communication is only possible between equals, because
inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant
lies than for telling the truth." --- a central tenet of {Discordianism}
often invoked by hackers to explain the reason authoritarian hierarchies
screw up so reliably and systematically. This lightly adapted version of a
fable dating back to the early 1960s illustrates the phenomenon perfectly: In
the beginning was the plan, and then the specification; And the plan was
without form, and the specification was void. And darkness was on the faces
of the implementors thereof; And they spake unto their leader, saying: "It is
a crock of shit, and smells as of a sewer." And the leader took pity on them,
and spoke to the project leader: "It is a crock of excrement, and none may
abide the odor thereof." And the project leader spake unto his section head,
saying: "It is a container of excrement, and it is very strong, such that
none may abide it." The section head then hurried to his department manager,
and informed him thus: "It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its
strength." The department manager carried these words to his general manager,
and spoke unto him saying: "It containeth that which aideth the growth of
plants, and it is very strong." And so it was that the General manager
rejoiced and delivered the good news unto the Vice President. "It promoteth
growth, and it is very powerful." The Vice President rushed to the
President's side, and joyously exclaimed: "This powerful new software product
will promote the growth of the company!" And the President looked upon the
product, and saw that it was very good. After the subsequent disaster, the
{suit}s protect themselves by saying "I was misinformed!", and the
implementors are demoted or fired. snail: vt. To {snail-mail} something.
"Snail me a copy of those graphics, will you?" snail-mail: n. Paper mail, as
opposed to electronic. Sometimes written as the single word `SnailMail'.
One's postal address is, correspondingly, a `snail address'. Derives from
earlier coinage `USnail' for which there have been parody posters and stamps
made. Oppose {email}. snarf: /snarf/ vt. 1. To grab, esp. a large document or
file for the purpose of using it with or without the author's permission. see
also {BLT}. Variant: `snarf down', to snarf, sometimes with the connotation
of absorbing, processing, or understanding. "I think I'll snarf down the list
of DDT commands so I'll know what's changed recently." 2. [in the UNIX
community] to fetch a file or set of files across a network. see also
{blast}. This term was mainstream in the late 1960s, meaning `to eat
piggishly'. It may still have this connotation in context. "He's in the
snarfing phase of hacking --- ftping megs of stuff a day." snarf & barf:
/snarf'n-barf/ n. Under a {WIMP environment}, the act of grabbing a region of
text and then stuffing the contents of that region into another region (or
the same one) to avoid re-typing a command line. In the late 1960s this was a
mainstream expression for an `eat now, regret it later' cheap-restaurant
expedition. snark: [Lewis Carroll, via the Michigan Terminal System] n. 1. A
system failure. When a user's process bombed, the operator would get a
message "Help, Help, Snark in MTS!". 2. More generally, any kind of
unexplained or threatening event on a computer (especially if it might be a
boojum). Often used to refer to an event or log file entry that might
indicate an attempted security violation. 3. UUCP name of snark.thyrsus.com,
home site of the Jargon File 2.*.* versions (i.e., this lexicon). sneakernet:
n. Term used (generally with ironic intent) for transfer of electronic
information by physically carrying tape, disks, or some other media from one
machine to another. "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon
filled with magtape, or a 747 filled with CD-ROMs." Also called `Tennis-Net',
`Armpit-Net', `Floppy-Net'. sniff: v.,n. Synonym for {poll}. snivitz:
/sniv'itz/ n. A hiccup in hardware or software; a small, transient problem of
unknown origin (less serious than a {snark}). SO: /ess-oh/ n. 1. (also
`S.O.') Abbrev for Significant Other, almost invariably written abbreviated
and pronounced /ess-oh/ by hackers. Used to refer to one's primary
relationship, esp. a live-in to whom one is not married. see {MOTAS},
{MOTOS}, {MOTSS}. 2. The Shift Out control character in ASCII (^N,
#b0001110). social science number: [IBM] n. A statistic which is
{content-free}, or nearly so. A measure derived via methods of questionable
validity from data of a dubious and vague nature. Predictively, having a
social science number in hand is seldom much better than nothing, and can be
considerably worse. {Management} loves them. see also {numbers}, {math-out},
{pretty pictures}. softcopy: n. [by analogy with `hardcopy'] A
machine-readable form of corresponding hardcopy. see {bits}, {softcopy}.
software bloat: n. The results of {second-system effect} or {creeping
featuritis}. Commonly cited examples include `ls(1)', {X}, {BSD},
{Missed'em-five}, and {OS/2}. software rot: n. Term used to describe the
tendency of software which has not been used in a while to {lose}; such
failure may be semi-humorously ascribed to {bit rot}. More commonly,
`software rot' strikes when a program's assumptions become out of date. If
the design was insufficiently {robust}, this may cause it to fail in
mysterious ways. For example, due to endemic shortsightedness in the design
of COBOL programs, most will succumb to software rot when their two-digit
year counters {wrap around} at the beginning of the year 2000. Actually,
related lossages often afflict centenarians that have to deal with computer
software designed by unimaginative clods. One such incident became the focus
of a minor public flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a
driver's license renewal in Raleigh, NC. The new system refused to issue the
card, probably because it did something like `if (birthyear < (thisyear -
100)) reject();'. Historical note: software rot in an even funnier sense than
the mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the
R1, see {grind crank}). If a program that depended on a peculiar instruction
hadn't been run in quite a while, the user might discover that the opcodes no
longer did the same things they used to. ("Hey, so-and-so needs an
instruction to do such-and-such. We can snarf this opcode, right? No one uses
it.") Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker
found a simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction
on a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware. Unfortunately, this broke some
fragile timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output out
of tune. This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine to
compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other words,
it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected appropriately.
Compare {bit rot}. softwarily: /soft-weir'i-lee/ adv. In a way pertaining to
software. "The system is softwarily unreliable." The adjective `softwary' is
*not* used. see {hardwarily}. softy: [IBM] n. Hardware hackers' term for a
software expert who is largely ignorant of the mysteries of hardware. some
random X: adj. Used to indicate a member of class X, with the implication
that Xs are fungible. "I think some random cracker tripped over the guest
timeout last night." see also {J. Random}. sorcerer's apprentice mode: [from
`Fantasia'] n. A bug in a protocol where, under some circumstances, the
receipt of a message causes more than one message to be sent, each of which,
when received, triggers the same bug. Used esp. of such behavior caused by
{bounce message} loops in {email} software. Compare {broadcast storm},
{network meltdown}.
