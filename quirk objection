 :Quirk objection: interj. [Named for Captain Gym Z. Quirk, the first to
raise it.] "Objection! Assumes organ not in evidence!" Used in
news.admin.net-abuse.email to point out that a comment assumes the presence
of something whose existence has not been proven, such as a spammer's brain
or gonads. This is not used to refer to things that are definitely proven not
to exist, such as a spammer's ethics. It's applicable to enough postings
there that a poster wishing to raise the objection often need merely say
"ObQuirk!", an instance of the {Ob-} convention.
