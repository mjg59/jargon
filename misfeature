 MISFEATURE n. A feature which eventually screws someone, possibly because it
is not adequate for a new situation which has evolved. It is not the same as
a bug because fixing it involves a gross philosophical change to the
structure of the system involved. Often a former feature becomes a misfeature
because a tradeoff was made whose parameters subsequently changed (possibly
only in the judgment of the implementors). "Well, yeah, it's kind of a
misfeature that file names are limited to six characters, but we're stuck
with it for now."
