 MISFEATURE /mis-fee'chr/ n. A feature which eventually screws someone,
possibly because it is not adequate for a new situation which has evolved. It
is not the same as a bug because fixing it involves a gross philosophical
change to the structure of the system involved. A misfeature is different
from a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the misfeature
was actually carefully planned to be that way, but future consequences or
circumstances just weren't predicted accurately. This is different from just
not having thought ahead about it at all. Often a former feature becomes a
misfeature because a tradeoff was made whose parameters subsequently changed
(possibly only in the judgment of the implementors). "Well, yeah, it's kind
of a misfeature that file names are limited to six characters, but the
original implementors wanted to save directory space and we're stuck with it
for now."
