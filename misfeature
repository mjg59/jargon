 :misfeature: /mis-fee'chr/ or /mis'fee`chr/ n. A feature that eventually
causes lossage, possibly because it is not adequate for a new situation which
has evolved. Since it results from a deliberate and properly-implemented
feature, a misfeature is not a bug. Nor is it a simple unforeseen side
effect; the term implies that the feature in question was carefully planned,
but its long-term consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted
(which is quite different from not having thought ahead at all). A misfeature
can be a particularly stubborn problem to resolve, because fixing it usually
involves a substantial philosophical change to the structure of the system
involved. Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise
because the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes for laws of
nature. Often a former feature becomes a misfeature because a tradeoff was
made whose parameters subsequently change (possibly only in the judgment of
the implementors). "Well, yeah, it is kind of a misfeature that file names
are limited to six characters, but the original implementors wanted to save
directory space and we're stuck with it for now."
