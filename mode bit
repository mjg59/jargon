 :mode bit: n. A {flag}, usually in hardware, that selects between two
(usually quite different) modes of operation. The connotations are different
from {flag} bit in that mode bits are mainly written during a boot or set-up
phase, are seldom explicitly read, and seldom change over the lifetime of an
ordinary program. The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII bit (#12) of
the Program Status Word of the IBM 360. Another was the bit on a PDP-12 that
controlled whether it ran the PDP-8 or the LINC instruction set.
