 :mode bit: n. [common] A {flag}, usually in hardware, that selects between
two (usually quite different) modes of operation. The connotations are
different from {flag} bit in that mode bits are mainly written during a boot
or set-up phase, are seldom explicitly read, and seldom change over the
lifetime of an ordinary program. The classic example was the EBCDIC-vs.-ASCII
bit (#12) of the Program Status Word of the IBM 360.
