 :crawling horror: n. Ancient crufty hardware or software that is kept
obstinately alive by forces beyond the control of the hackers at a site. Like
{dusty deck} or {gonkulator}, but connotes that the thing described is not
just an irritation but an active menace to health and sanity. "Mostly we code
new stuff in C, but they pay us to maintain one big FORTRAN II application
from nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling horror...." Compare {WOMBAT}.
This usage is almost certainly derived from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft.
Lovecraft may never have used the exact phrase "crawling horror" in his
writings, but one of the fearsome Elder Gods that he wrote extensively about
was Nyarlethotep, who had as an epithet "The Crawling Chaos". Certainly the
extreme, even melodramatic horror of his characters at the weird monsters
they encounter, even to the point of going insane with fear, is what hackers
are referring to with this phrase when they use it for horribly bad code.
Compare {cthulhic}.
