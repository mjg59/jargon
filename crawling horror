 :crawling horror: n. Ancient crufty hardware or software that is kept
obstinately alive by forces beyond the control of the hackers at a site. Like
{dusty deck} or {gonkulator}, but connotes that the thing described is not
just an irritation but an active menace to health and sanity. "Mostly we code
new stuff in C, but they pay us to maintain one big FORTRAN II application
from nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling horror...." Compare {WOMBAT}.
