 CRAWLING HORROR n. Ancient crufty hardware or software that forces beyond
the control of the hackers at a site refuse to let die. Like DUSTY DECK or
GONKULATOR, but connotes that the thing described is not just an irritation
but an active menace to health and sanity. "Mostly we code new stuff in C,
but they pay us to maintain one big Fortran II application from
nineteen-sixty-X that's a real crawling horror...". Compare WOMBAT.
