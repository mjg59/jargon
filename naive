 :naive: adj. 1. Untutored in the perversities of some particular program or
system; one who still tries to do things in an intuitive way, rather than the
right way (in really good designs these coincide, but most designs aren't
`really good' in the appropriate sense). This trait is completely unrelated
to general maturity or competence, or even competence at any other specific
program. It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of computing that the
natural opposite of this term is often claimed to be `experienced user' but
is really more like `cynical user'. 2. Said of an algorithm that doesn't take
advantage of some superior but advanced technique, e.g., the {bubble sort}.
It may imply naivete on the part of the programmer, although there are
situations where a naive algorithm is preferred, because it is more important
to keep the code comprehensible than to go for maximum performance. "I know
the linear search is naive, but in this case the list typically only has half
a dozen items." Compare {brute force}.
