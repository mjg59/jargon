 :legal: adj. Loosely used to mean `in accordance with all the relevant
rules', esp. in connection with some set of constraints defined by software.
"The older =+ alternate for += is no longer legal syntax in ANSI C." "This
parser processes each line of legal input the moment it sees the trailing
linefeed." Hackers often model their work as a sort of game played with the
environment in which the objective is to maneuver through the thicket of
`natural laws' to achieve a desired objective. Their use of legal is flavored
as much by this game-playing sense as by the more conventional one having to
do with courts and lawyers. Compare {language lawyer}, {legalese}.
