 :catatonic: /adj./ Describes a condition of suspended animation in which
something is so {wedged} or {hung} that it makes no response. If you are
typing on a terminal and suddenly the computer doesn't even echo the letters
back to the screen as you type, let alone do what you're asking it to do,
then the computer is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has
crashed). "There I was in the middle of a winning game of {nethack} and it
went catatonic on me! Aaargh!" Compare {buzz}.
