 :plan file: [UNIX] n. On systems that support {finger}, the `.plan' file in
a user's home directory is displayed when the user is fingered. This feature
was originally intended to be used to keep potential fingerers apprised of
one's location and near-future plans, but has been turned almost universally
to humorous and self-expressive purposes (like a {sig block}). see {Hacking X
for Y}.
