 :plan file: n. [Unix] On systems that support {finger}, the .plan file in a
user's home directory is displayed when the user is fingered. This feature
was originally intended to be used to keep potential fingerers apprised of
one's location and near-future plans, but has been turned almost universally
to humorous and self-expressive purposes (like a {sig block}). see also
{Hacking X for Y}. A recent innovation in plan files has been the
introduction of "scrolling plan files" which are one-dimensional animations
made using only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line
feed, avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the {finger} command
will (for security reasons; see {letterbomb}) not pass the escape character.
Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some sites have
started competitions to find who can create the longest running, funniest,
and most original animations. Various animation characters include:
Centipede: mmmmme Lorry/Truck: oo-oP Andalusian Video Snail: _@/ and a
compiler (ASP) is available on Usenet for producing them. see also {twirling
baton}.
