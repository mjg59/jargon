 :core: /n./ Main storage or RAM. Dates from the days of ferrite-core memory;
now archaic as techspeak most places outside IBM, but also still used in the
Unix community and by old-time hackers or those who would sound like them.
Some derived idioms are quite current; `in core', for example, means `in
memory' (as opposed to `on disk'), and both {core dump} and the `core image'
or `core file' produced by one are terms in favor. Some varieties of
Commonwealth hackish prefer {store}.
