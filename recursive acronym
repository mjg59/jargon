 :recursive acronym: n. A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to choose
acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other
acronyms/abbreviations. The original of the breed may have been TINT ("TINT
Is Not TECO"). The classic examples were two MIT editors called EINE ("EINE
Is Not EMACS") and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially"). More recently, there is
a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply Recursively), and {GNU}
(q.v., sense 1) stands for "GNU's Not Unix!" -- and a company with the name
Cygnus, which expands to "Cygnus, Your GNU Support" (though Cygnus people say
this is a {backronym}). The GNU recursive acronym may have been patterned on
XINU, "XINU Is Not Unix" -- a particularly nice example because it is a
mirror image, a backronym, and a recursive acronym. see also {mung}, {EMACS}.
