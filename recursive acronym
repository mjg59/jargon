 :recursive acronym:: n. A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to
choose acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other
acronyms/abbreviations. The classic examples were two MIT editors called EINE
("EINE Is Not EMACS") and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially"). More recently,
there is a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply Recursively), and
{GNU} (q.v., sense 1) stands for "GNU's Not UNIX!" -- and a company with the
name CYGNUS, which expands to "Cygnus, Your GNU Support". see also {mung},
{EMACS}.
