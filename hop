 :hop: n. One file transmission in a series required to get a file from point
A to point B on a store-and-forward network. On such networks (including
{UUCPNET} and {FidoNet}), the important inter-machine metric is the number of
hops in the shortest path between them, rather than their geographical
separation. see {bang path}.
