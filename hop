 :hop: 1. n. One file transmission in a series required to get a file from
point A to point B on a store-and-forward network. On such networks
(including {UUCPNET} and {FidoNet}), an important inter-machine metric is the
number of hops in the shortest path between them, which can be more
significant than their geographical separation. see {bang path}. 2. v. To log
in to a remote machine, esp. via rlogin or telnet. "I'll hop over to foovax
to FTP that."
