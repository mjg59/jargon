 :pred: // [Usenet; orig. fr. the Island MUD via Oxford University]
Abbreviation for "predictable", used to signify or preempt responses that are
extremely predictable but have to be filled in for the sake of form (the
phrase is bracketed by <pred>...</pred>). X-Pred headers in mail or news
serve the same end. Figuring out the connection between the X-Pred tagline
and the thread is part of the entertainment. For example, it is said that any
thread about taxation must contain a reference to Raquel Welch, if only to
stop other people from mentioning her. This is allegedly due to a Monty
Python sketch where a character declares that he would tax Raquel Welch, and
he has a feeling she would tax him.
