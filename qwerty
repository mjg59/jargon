 :QWERTY: /kwerÂ´tee/, adj. [from the keycaps at the upper left] Pertaining to
a standard English-language typewriter keyboard (sometimes called the Sholes
keyboard after its inventor), as opposed to Dvorak or non-US-ASCII layouts or
a {space-cadet keyboard} or APL keyboard. Historical note: The QWERTY layout
is a fine example of a {fossil}. It is sometimes said that it was designed to
slow down the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to allow faster
typing -- under a constraint now long obsolete. In early typewriters, fast
typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism. So Sholes fiddled the
layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs (he did a far from
perfect job, though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er', for example, each use two
nearby keys). Also, putting the letters of `typewriter' on one line allowed
it to be typed with particular speed and accuracy for {demo}s. The jamming
problem was essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs,
but the keyboard layout lives on. The QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some
unhelpful economic myths about how technical standards get and stay
established; see http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html. R rabbit job
