 QWERTY: /kwer'tee/ [from the keycaps at the upper left] adj. Pertaining to a
standard English-language typewriter keyboard (sometimes called the Sholes
keyboard after its inventor), as opposed to Dvorak or foreign-language
layouts or a {space-cadet keyboard} or APL keyboard. Historical note: the
QWERTY layout (one of the worst disasters in the history of human-factors
design) was actually designed to be deliberately slow! Sholes tried to put
common digraphs far apart, because fast typing of near-adjacent keys jammed
up early mechanical typewriters. He did a poor job; `th', `er' and other
common digraphs were close enough together to induce frequent jams. The
QWERTY layout is therefore more than just {cretinous}, it is {bogus} in its
very cretinosity! = R = ===== rain dance: n. 1. Any ceremonial action taken
to correct a hardware problem, with the expectation that nothing will be
accomplished. This especially applies to reseating printed circuit boards,
reconnecting cables, etc. "I can't boot up the machine. We'll have to wait
for Greg to do his rain dance." 2. Any arcane sequence of actions performed
with computers or software in order to achieve some goal; the term is usually
restricted to rituals that include both an {incantation} or two and physical
activity or motion. Compare {magic}, {voodoo programming}, {black art}.
random: adj. 1. Unpredictable (closest to mathematical definition); weird.
"The system's been behaving pretty randomly." 2. Assorted; undistinguished.
"Who was at the conference?" "Just a bunch of random business types." 3.
(pejorative) Frivolous; unproductive; undirected. "He's just a random loser."
4. Incoherent or inelegant; not well organized. "The program has a random set
of misfeatures." "That's a random name for that function." "Well, all the
names were chosen pretty randomly." 5. In no particular order, though
deterministic. "The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file is opened one
is chosen randomly." 6. Arbitrary. "It generates a random name for the
scratch file." 7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done and for no good
apparent reason. For example, a program that handles file name defaulting in
a particularly useless way, or an assembler routine that could easily have
been coded using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values
with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it without
first saving four extra registers. What {randomness}! 8. n. A random hacker;
used particularly of high school students who soak up computer time and
generally get in the way. 9. n. Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes,
anyone not known to the hacker speaking); the noun form of sense #2. "I went
to the talk, but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions".
10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall. see also {J.
Random}, {some random X}. random numbers:: n. When one wishes to specify a
large but random number of things, and the context is inappropriate for {N},
certain numbers are preferred by hacker tradition (that is, easily recognized
as placeholders). These include 17 Long described at MIT as `the least random
number', see 23. 23 Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17
and 5). 42 The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and
Everything. (Note that this answer is completely fortuitous.) 69 From the
sexual act. This one was favored in MIT's ITS culture. 105 69 hex = 105
decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal. 666 The Number of the Beast. For further
enlightenment, consult the `Principia Discordia', `The Hitchhiker's Guide To
The Galaxy', `The Joy of Sex', and the Christian Bible's `Book Of
Revelations' (chapter 13, verse 18). see also {Discordianism} or consult your
pineal gland. One common rhetorical maneuver uses any of the canonical random
numbers as placeholders for variables. One might hear "The max function takes
42 arguments, for arbitrary values of 42." or "There are 69 ways to leave
your lover, for 69 = 50." This is especially likely when the speaker has
uttered a random number and realizes that it was not recognized as such, but
even `non-random' numbers are occasionally used in this fashion. A related
joke is that "Pi equals 3 --- for small values of pi and large values of 3."
randomness: n. An unexplainable misfeature; gratuitous inelegance. Also, a
{hack} or {crock} which depends on a complex combination of coincidences (or
possibly, the combination upon which the crock depends for its accidental
failure to malfunction). "This hack can output characters 40--57 by putting
the character in the accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting 6 bits
--- the low two bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing." "What
randomness!" rape: vt. 1. To {screw} someone or something, violently; in
particular, to destroy a program or information irrecoverably. Usage: often
used in describing file-system damage. "So-and-so was running a program that
did absolute disk I/O and ended up raping the master directory." 2. To strip
a piece of hardware for parts. rare: [UNIX] adj. CBREAK mode
(character-by-character with interrupts enabled). Distinguished from {raw
mode} and `cooked mode'; the phrase "a sort of half-cooked (rare?) mode" is
used in the V7/BSD manuals to describe the mode. Usage: rare. raster blaster:
n. [Cambridge] Specialized hardware for {bitblt} operations (a {blitter}).
Allegedly inspired by analogy with `Rasta Blasta', British slang for the sort
of portable stereo/radio/tapedeck Americans call a `boom box' or `ghetto
blaster'. raster burn: n. Eyestrain brought on by too many hours of looking
at low-res, poorly tuned, or glare-ridden monitors, esp. graphics monitors.
see {terminal illness}. rat belt: n. A cable tie, esp. the sawtoothed,
self-locking plastic kind that you can only remove by cutting (as opposed to
a random twist of wire or a baggie tie or one of those humongous metal clip
frobs). Small cable ties are `mouse belts'. rave: [WPI] vi. 1. To persist in
discussing a specific subject. 2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about
which one knows very little. 3. To complain to a person who is not in a
position to correct the difficulty. 4. To purposely annoy another person
verbally. 5. To evangelize. see {flame}. 6. Also used to describe a less
negative form of blather, such as friendly bullshitting. `Rave' differs
slightly from {flame} in that `rave' implies that it is the persistence or
obliviousness of the person speaking that is annoying, while {flame} implies
somewhat more strongly that the tone is offensive as well. rave on!: imp.
Sarcastic invitation to continue a {rave}, often by someone who wishes the
raver would get a clue but realizes this is unlikely. ravs: /ravz/, also
`Chinese ravs' n. Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie (pan-fried). A
Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as dumplings, pot stickers
(the literal translation of guo-tie), and (around Boston) `Peking Ravioli'.
The term `rav' is short for `ravioli', which among hackers always means the
Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind. Both consist of a filling in a
pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, a
pork-vegetable filling (good ones include Chinese chives), and is cooked
differently, either by steaming or frying. A rav or dumpling can be cooked
any way, but a potsticker is always the fried kind (so called because it
sticks to the frying pot and has to be scraped off). "Let's get hot-and-sour
soup and three orders of ravs." see also {{Oriental Food}}. raw mode: n. A
mode that allows a program to transfer bits directly to or from an I/O device
without any processing, abstraction, or interpretation by the operating
system. Compare {rare}. This is techspeak under UNIX, jargon elsewhere.
