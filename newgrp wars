 NEWGRP WARS /n[y]oo'grp wohrz/ [USENET] n. Salvos of dueling `newgrp' and
`rmgroup' messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a
dispute over whether a NEWSGROUP should be created netwide. These usually
settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the group has a
natural constituency (usually, it doesn't). At times, especially in the
completely anarchic `alt' hierarchy, the names of newsgroups themselves
become a form of comment or humor; cf. the spinoff of
alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork from alt.tv.muppets in early 1990, or any
number of specialized abuse groups named after particularly notorious
FLAMERs.
