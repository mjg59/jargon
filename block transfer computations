 BLOCK TRANSFER COMPUTATIONS (blok trans'fer kom-pyoo-tay'shns) n. From the
Dr. Who television series: in the show, it referred to computations so
fiendishly subtle and complex that they could not be performed by machines.
Used to refer to any task that should be expressible as an algorithm in
theory, but isn't.
