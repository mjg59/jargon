 :platinum-iridium: adj. Standard, against which all others of the same
category are measured. Usage: silly. The notion is that one of whatever it is
has actually been cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault
beside the Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures near Paris. (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the
distance between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same
vault -- this replaced an earlier definition as 10^-7 times the distance
between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris;
unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the circumference
of the Earth. From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be 1650763.73 wavelengths
of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating in a vacuum. It is now
defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in the time
interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The kilogram is now the only unit of
measure officially defined in terms of a unique artifact.) "This
garbage-collection algorithm has been tested against the platinum-iridium
cons cell in Paris." Compare {golden}.
