 :silicon foundry: n. A company that {fab}s chips to the designs of others.
As of the late 1980s, the combination of silicon foundries and good
computer-aided design software made it much easier for hardware-designing
startup companies to come into being. The downside of using a silicon foundry
is that the distance from the actual chip-fabrication processes reduces
designers' control of detail. This is somewhat analogous to the use of {HLL}s
versus coding in assembler.
