 :P.O.D.: /P-O-D/ [rare; sometimes `POD' without the periods] Acronym for
`Piece Of Data' or `Plain Old Data' (as opposed to a code section, or a
section containing mixed code and data). see also {pod}. The latter expansion
was in use by the C++ standards committee, for which it indicated a struct or
class which only contains data (as in C), distinguished from one which has a
constructor and member functions. There are things which you can do with a
P.O.D. which you can't with a more general class.
