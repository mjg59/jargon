 :heatseeker: [IBM] n. A customer who can be relied upon to buy, without
fail, the latest version of an existing product (not quite the same as a
member the {lunatic fringe}). A 1993 example of a heatseeker is someone who,
owning a 286 PC and Windows 3.0, goes out and buys Windows 3.1 (which offers
no worthwhile benefits unless you have a 386). If all customers were
heatseekers, vast amounts of money could be made by just fixing the bugs in
each release (n) and selling it to them as release (n+1).
