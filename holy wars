 :holy wars: [from {Usenet}, but may predate it] n. {flame war}s over
{religious issues}. The paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the terms
{big-endian} and {little-endian} in connection with the LSB-first/MSB-first
controversy was entitled "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace". Other perennial
Holy Wars have included {EMACS} vs. {vi}, my personal computer vs. everyone
else's personal computer, {{ITS}} vs. {{UNIX}}, {{UNIX}} vs. {VMS}, {BSD}
UNIX vs. {USG UNIX}, {C} vs. {{Pascal}}, {C} vs. FORTRAN, etc., ad nauseam.
The characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical
disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time
trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as
objective technical evaluations. see also {theology}.
