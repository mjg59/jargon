 :holy wars: n. [from {Usenet}, but may predate it; common] n. {flame war}s
over {religious issues}. The paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the terms
{big-endian} and {little-endian} in connection with the LSB-first/MSB-first
controversy was entitled On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace. Great holy wars
of the past have included {ITS} vs.: {Unix}, {Unix} vs.: {VMS}, {BSD} Unix
vs.: System V, {C} vs.: {Pascal}, {C} vs.: FORTRAN, etc. In the year 2003,
popular favorites of the day are KDE vs, GNOME, vim vs. elvis, Linux vs.
[Free|Net|Open]BSD. Hardy perennials include {EMACS} vs.: {vi}, my personal
computer vs.: everyone else's personal computer, ad nauseam. The
characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical disputes is
that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time trying to pass
off personal value choices and cultural attachments as objective technical
evaluations. This happens precisely because in a true holy war, the actual
substantive differences between the sides are relatively minor. see also
{theology}.
