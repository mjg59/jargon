 HOLY WARS [from USENET, but may predate it] n. FLAME WARS over RELIGIOUS
ISSUES. The 1980 paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the terms BIG-ENDIAN
and LITTLE-ENDIAN in connection with the LSB-first/MSB-first controversy was
entitled "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace". Other perennial Holy Wars have
included: EMACS vs. VI, <my personal computer> vs. <everyone else's personal
computer>, UNIX vs. VMS, BSD UNIX vs. AT&T UNIX, C vs. Pascal, etc. etc. etc.
The characteristic that distinguishes HOLY WARS from normal technical
disputes is that (regardless of the technical merits of the case on either
side) most participants spend their time trying to pass off personal value
choices and cultural attachments as objective technical evaluations.
