 :Death, X of: [common] A construction used to imbue the subject with campy
menace, usually with intent to ridicule. The ancestor of this term is a
famous Far Side cartoon from the 1980s in which a balloon with a fierce face
painted on it is passed off as the "Floating Head of Death". Hackers and SF
fans have been using the suffix "of Death" ever since to label things which
appear to be vastly threatening but will actually pop like a balloon if you
prick them. Such constructions are properly spoken in a tone of
over-exagerrated portentiousness: "Behold! The Spinning - Pizza - of -
Death!" see {Blue Screen of Death}, {Ping O' Death}, {Spinning Pizza of
Death}, {click of death}. Compare {Doom, X of}.
