 :zeroth: /zee'rohth/ adj. First. Among software designers, comes from C's
and LISP's 0-based indexing of arrays. Hardware people also tend to start
counting at 0 instead of 1; this is natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8
bits correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices
known as `counters' count in this way. Hackers and computer scientists often
like to call the first chapter of a publication `Chapter 0', especially if it
is of an introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First
Edition of {K&R}). In recent years this trait has also been observed among
many pure mathematicians (who have an independent tradition of numbering from
0). Zero-based numbering tends to reduce {fencepost error}s, though it cannot
eliminate them entirely.
