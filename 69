 69 adj. Large quantity. Usage: Exclusive to MIT-AI. "Go away, I have 69
things to do to DDT before worrying about fixing the bug in the phase of the
moon output routine..." [Note: Actually, any number less than 100 but large
enough to have no obvious magic properties will be recognized as a "large
number". There is no denying that "69" is the local favorite. I don't know
whether its origins are related to the obscene interpretation, but I do know
that 69 decimal = 105 octal, and 69 hexadecimal = 105 decimal, which is a
nice property. - GLS]
