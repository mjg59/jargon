 :manularity: [prob. fr. techspeak `granularity' + `manual'] n. A notional
measure of the manual labor required for some task, particularly one of the
sort that automation is supposed to eliminate. "Composing English on paper
has much higher manularity than using a text editor, especially in the
revising stage." Hackers tend to consider manularity a symptom of primitive
methods; in fact, a true hacker confronted with an apparent requirement to do
a computing task {by hand} will usually consider it motivation enough to
build another tool.
