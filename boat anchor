 :boat anchor: n. [common; from ham radio] 1. Like {doorstop} but more
severe; implies that the offending hardware is irreversibly dead or useless.
"That was a working motherboard once. One lightning strike later, instant
boat anchor!" 2. A person who just takes up space. 3. Obsolete but still
working hardware, especially when used of an old S100-bus hobbyist system;
originally a term of annoyance, but became more and more affectionate as the
hardware became more and more obsolete. Auctioneers use this term for a
large, undesirable object such as a washing machine; actual boating
enthusiasts, however, use "mooring anchor" for frustrating (not actually
useless) equipment.
