 :handwave: [poss. from gestures characteristic of stage magicians] 1. v. To
gloss over a complex point; to distract a listener; to support a (possibly
actually valid) point with blatantly faulty logic. 2. n. The act of
handwaving. "Boy, what a handwave!" If someone starts a sentence with
"Clearly..." or "Obviously..." or "It is self-evident that...", it is a good
bet he is about to handwave (alternatively, use of these constructions in a
sarcastic tone before a paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that
it is a handwave). The theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands
at the right moment, the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not
notice that what you have said is {bogus}. Failing that, if a listener does
object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your hand. The
use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands up, palms
forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at the elbows and/or
shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave); alternatively,
holding the forearms in one position while rotating the hands at the wrist to
make them flutter. In context, the gestures alone can suffice as a remark; if
a speaker makes an outrageously unsupported assumption, you might simply wave
your hands in this way, as an accusation, far more eloquent than words could
express, that his logic is faulty.
