 HANDWAVE 1. v. To gloss over a complex point; to distract a listener; to
support a (possibly actually valid) point with blatantly faulty logic. If
someone starts a sentence with "Clearly..." or "Obviously..." or "It is
self-evident that...", you can be sure he is about to handwave. The theory
behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment, the
listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you have said
is BOGUS. Alternatively, if a listener does object, you might try to dismiss
the objection with a wave of your hand. 2. n. The act of handwaving. "Boy,
what a handwave!" The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both
hands up, palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at
the elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave);
alternatively, holding the forearms still while rotating the hands at the
wrist to make them flutter. In context, the gestures alone can suffice as a
remark; if a speaker makes an outrageous unsupported assumption, you might
simply wave your hands in this way, as an accusation more eloquent than words
could express that his logic is faulty
