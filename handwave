 HANDWAVE 1. v. To gloss over a complex point; to distract a listener; to
support a (possibly actually valid) point with blatantly faulty logic. 2. n.
The act of handwaving. "Boy, what a handwave!" The use of this word is often
accompanied by gestures: both hands up, palms forward, swinging the hands in
a vertical plane pivoting at the elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the
magnitude of the handwave); alternatively, holding the forearms still while
rotating the hands at the wrist to make them flutter. In context, the
gestures alone can suffice as a remark.
