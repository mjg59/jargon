 :death code: /n./ A routine whose job is to set everything in the computer
-- registers, memory, flags, everything -- to zero, including that portion of
memory where it is running; its last act is to stomp on its own "store zero"
instruction. Death code isn't very useful, but writing it is an interesting
hacking challenge on architectures where the instruction set makes it
possible, such as the PDP-8 (it has also been done on the DG Nova). Perhaps
the ultimate death code is on the TI 990 series, where all registers are
actually in RAM, and the instruction "store immediate 0" has the opcode "0".
The PC will immediately wrap around core as many times as it can until a user
hits HALT. Any empty memory location is death code. Worse, the manufacturer
recommended use of this instruction in startup code (which would be in ROM
and therefore survive).
