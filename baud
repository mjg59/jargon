 :baud: /bawd/ [simplified from its technical meaning] n. Bits per second.
Hence kilobaud or Kbaud, thousands of bits per second. The technical meaning
is `level transitions per second'; this coincides with bps only for two-level
modulation with no framing or stop bits. Most hackers are aware of these
nuances but blithely ignore them. Historical note: this was originally a unit
of telegraph signalling speed, set at one pulse per second. It was proposed
at the International Telegraph Conference of 1927, and named after J.M.E.
Baudot (1845--1903), the French engineer who constructed the first successful
teleprinter.
