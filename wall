 WALKING DRIVES An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in
the days when they were 14" wide WASHING MACHINES. Those old DINOSAURS
carried terrific angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or
worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
"walk" across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of
millimeters at a time. This could also be induced by certain patterns of
drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a
slow seek in the other direction). It is known that some bands of old-time
hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this
to particular drive models and held disk-drive races. This is not a joke!
WALL [shortened form of HELLO WALL, apparently from the phrase "up against a
blank wall"] [WPI] interj. 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken with
a quizzical tone. "Wall??" 2. A request for further explication. Compare
