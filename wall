 :wall: interj. [WPI] 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken with a
quizzical tone: "Wall??" 2. A request for further explication. Compare {octal
forty}. 3. [Unix, from `write all'] v. To send a message to everyone
currently logged in, esp. with the wall(8) utility. It is said that sense 1
came from the idiom `like talking to a blank wall'. It was originally used in
situations where, after you had carefully answered a question, the questioner
stared at you blankly, clearly having understood nothing that was explained.
You would then throw out a "Hello, wall?" to elicit some sort of response
from the questioner. Later, confused questioners began voicing "Wall?"
themselves.
