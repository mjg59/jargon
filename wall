 WALL [WPI] interj. 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken with a
quizzical tone. "Wall??" 2. A request for further explication. Compare OCTAL
FORTY. It is said that "WALL?" really came from "talking to a blank wall". It
was initially used in situations where, after one carefully answered a
question, the questioner stared at you blankly, having understood nothing
that was explained. One would then throw out a "HELLO, WALL?" to elicit some
sort of response from the questioner. Later, confused questioners began
voicing "WALL?" themselves. There is an anecdote about a child in a hospital
who is addressed by a nurse over an intercom and replies "What do you want,
Wall?"
