 :backward combatability: /bak'w*rd k*m-bat'*-bil'*-tee/ [from `backward
compatibility'] n. A property of hardware or software revisions in which
previous protocols, formats, and layouts are discarded in favor of `new and
improved' protocols, formats, and layouts. Occurs usually when making the
transition between major releases. When the change is so drastic that the old
formats are not retained in the new version, it is said to be `backward
combatable'. see {flag day}.
