 :critical mass: n. In physics, the minimum amount of fissionable material
required to sustain a chain reaction. Of a software product, describes a
condition of the software such that fixing one bug introduces one plus
{epsilon} bugs. (This malady has many causes: {creeping featurism}, ports to
too many disparate environments, poor initial design, etc.) When software
achieves critical mass, it can never be fixed; it can only be discarded and
rewritten.
