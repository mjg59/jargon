 :ICBM address: n. (Also `missile address') The form used to register a site
with the Usenet mapping project, back before the day of pervasive Internet,
included a blank for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc
accuracy. This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps
of Usenet links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to this
as one's `ICBM address' or `missile address', and some people include it in
their {sig block} with that name. (A real missile address would include
target elevation.)
