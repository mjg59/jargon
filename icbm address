 :ICBM address: n. (Also `missile address') The form used to register a site
with the Usenet mapping project includes a blank for longitude and latitude,
preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy. This is actually used for generating
geographically-correct maps of Usenet links on a plotter; however, it has
become traditional to refer to this as one's `ICBM address' or `missile
address', and many people include it in their {sig block} with that name. (A
real missile address would include target altitude.)
