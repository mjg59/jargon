 :Parkinson's Law of Data: /prov./ "Data expands to fill the space available
for storage"; buying more memory encourages the use of more memory-intensive
techniques. It has been observed over the last 10 years that the memory usage
of evolving systems tends to double roughly once every 18 months.
Fortunately, memory density available for constant dollars also tends to
double about once every 12 months (see {Moore's Law}); unfortunately, the
laws of physics guarantee that the latter cannot continue indefinitely.
