 :Parkinson's Law of Data: prov. "Data expands to fill the space available
for storage"; buying more memory encourages the use of more memory-intensive
techniques. It has been observed since the mid-1980s that the memory usage of
evolving systems tends to double roughly once every 18 months. Fortunately,
memory density available for constant dollars also tends to about double once
every 18 months (see {Moore's Law}); unfortunately, the laws of physics
guarantee that the latter cannot continue indefinitely.
