 :fontology: [XEROX PARC] n. The body of knowledge dealing with the
construction and use of new fonts (e.g. for window systems and typesetting
software). It has been said that fontology recapitulates file-ogeny.
[Unfortunately, this reference to the embryological dictum that "Ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny" is not merely a joke. On the Macintosh, for example,
System 7 has to go through contortions to compensate for an earlier design
error that created a whole different set of abstractions for fonts parallel
to `files' and `folders' --- ESR]
