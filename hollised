 :hollised: /hol'ist/ /adj./ [Usenet: sci.space] To be hollised is to have
been ordered by one's employer not to post any even remotely job-related
material to USENET (or, by extension, to other Internet media). The original
and most notorious case of this involved one Ken Hollis, a Lockheed employee
and space-program enthusiast who posted publicly available material on access
to Space Shuttle launches to sci.space. He was gagged under threat of being
fired in 1994 at the behest of NASA public-relations officers. The result
was, of course, a huge publicity black eye for NASA. Nevertheless several
other NASA contractor employees were subsequently hollised for similar
activities. Use of this term carries the strong connotation that the persons
doing the gagging are bureaucratic idiots blinded to their own best interests
by territorial reflexes.
