 DONGLE (don-gl) n. 1. A security device for commercial microcomputer
programs consisting of a serialized EPROM and some drivers in an RS-232
connector shell. Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and
programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does not respond with
the dongle's programmed validation code. Thus, users could make as many
copies of the program as they want but must pay for each dongle. The idea was
clever but initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this
way. Most dongles on the market today (1990) will pass through the port, and
monitor for "magic codes" (and combinations of status lines) with minimal if
any interference with devices further down the line (this innovation was
necessary to allow daisy chained dongles for multiple pieces of software).
The devices are still not widely used, as the industry has trended away from
copy-protection schemes in general. 2. By extension, any physical electronic
key or transferable ID required for a program to function. see DONGLE-DISK.
