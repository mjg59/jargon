 DONGLE (don-gl) n. 1. A security device for commercial microcomputer
programs consisting of a serialized EPROM and some drivers in an RS-232
connector shell. Programs that use a dongle query the port at startup and
programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it does not respond with
the dongle's programmed validation code. Thus, users could make as many
copies of the program as they want but must pay for each dongle. The idea was
clever but a practical failure, as users disliked tyng up a serial port this
way. 2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferable ID required
for a program to function. see DONGLE DISK.
