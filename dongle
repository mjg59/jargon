 :dongle: /dong'gl/ n. 1. A security or {copy protection} device for
commercial microcomputer programs consisting of a serialized EPROM and some
drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port of
the computer while the program is run. Programs that use a dongle query the
port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate if it
does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code. Thus, users
can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for each
dongle. The idea was clever, but it was initially a failure, as users
disliked tying up a serial port this way. Most dongles on the market today
(1991) will pass data through the port and monitor for {magic} codes (and
combinations of status lines) with minimal if any interference with devices
further down the line --- this innovation was necessary to allow
daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces of software. The devices are still
not widely used, as the industry has moved away from copy-protection schemes
in general. 2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferrable ID
required for a program to function. Common variations on this theme have used
parallel or even joystick ports. see {dongle-disk}. [Note: in early 1992,
advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a manufacturer of dongles)
included a claim that the word derived from "Don Gall", allegedly the
inventor of the device. The company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you
that the story is a myth invented for the ad copy. Nevertheless, I expect it
to haunt my life as a lexicographer for at least the next ten years. --- ESR]
