 :to a first approximation: adj. 1. [techspeak] When one is doing certain
numerical computations, an approximate solution may be computed by any of
several heuristic methods, then refined to a final value. By using the
starting point of a first approximation of the answer, one can write an
algorithm that converges more quickly to the correct result. 2. In jargon, a
preface to any comment that indicates that the comment is only approximately
true. The remark "To a first approximation, I feel good" might indicate that
deeper questioning would reveal that not all is perfect (e.g., a nagging
cough still remains after an illness).
