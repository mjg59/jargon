 :PETSCII: /pet'skee/ n. obs. [abbreviation of PET ASCII] The variation (many
would say perversion) of the {{ASCII}} character set used by the Commodore
Business Machines PET series of personal computers and the later Commodore
C64, C16, C128, and VIC20 machines. The PETSCII set used left-arrow and
up-arrow (as in old-style ASCII) instead of underscore and caret, placed the
unshifted alphabet at positions 65-90, put the shifted alphabet at positions
193-218, and added graphics characters.
