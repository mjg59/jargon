 WIZARD n. 1. A person who knows how a complex piece of software or hardware
works (that is, who GROKS it); esp. someone who can find and fix bugs quickly
in an emergency. This term differs somewhat from HACKER. Someone is a hacker
if he has general hacking ability, but is only a wizard with respect to
something if he has specific detailed knowledge of that thing. A good hacker
could become a wizard for something given the time to study it. 2. A person
who is permitted to do things forbidden to ordinary people. For example, an
Adventure wizard at Stanford may play the Adventure game during the day,
which is forbidden (the program simply refuses to play) to most people
because it uselessly consumes too many CYCLES. 3. A UNIX expert, esp. a UNIX
systems programmer. This usage is well enough established that UNIX WIZARD is
a recognized job title at some corporations and to most headhunters. see
GURU.
