 :chad box: /n./ A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in some models
a large wastebasket), for collecting the {chad} (sense 2) that accumulated in
{Iron Age} card punches. You had to open the covers of the card punch
periodically and empty the chad box. The {bit bucket} was notionally the
equivalent device in the CPU enclosure, which was typically across the room
in another great gray-and-blue box.
