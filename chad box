 :chad box: n. {Iron Age} card punches contained boxes inside them, about the
size of a lunchbox (or in some models a large wastebasket), that held the
{chad} (sense 2). You had to open the covers of the card punch periodically
and empty the chad box. The {bit bucket} was notionally the equivalent device
in the CPU enclosure, which was typically across the room in another great
gray-and-blue box.
