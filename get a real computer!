 :Get a real computer!: imp. Typical hacker response to news that somebody is
having trouble getting work done on a system that (a) is single-tasking, (b)
has no hard disk, or (c) has an address space smaller than 16 megabytes. This
is as of mid-1993; note that the threshold for `real computer' rises with
time, and it may well be (for example) that machines with character-only
displays will be generally considered `unreal' in a few years (GLS points out
that they already are in some circles). see {bitty box} and {toy}.
