 :Get a real computer!: imp. In 1996 when this entry first entered the File,
it was the typical hacker response to news that somebody is having trouble
getting work done on a system that (a) was single-tasking, (b) had no hard
disk, or (c) had an address space smaller than 16 megabytes. In 2003 anything
less powerful than a 500MHz Pentium with a multi-gigabyte hard disk would
probably be similarly written off. The threshold for `real computer' rises
with time. see {bitty box} and {toy}.
