 :Get a real computer!: /imp./ Typical hacker response to news that somebody
is having trouble getting work done on a system that (a) is single-tasking,
(b) has no hard disk, or (c) has an address space smaller than 16 megabytes.
This is as of early 1996; note that the threshold for `real computer' rises
with time. see {bitty box} and {toy}.
