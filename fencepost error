 :fencepost error: n. 1. A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary
condition. Often exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the following
problem: "If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how
many posts do you need?" Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious
10. For example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and want to
process items m through n; how many items are there? The obvious answer is n
- m, but that is off by one; the right answer is n - m + 1. A program that
used the `obvious' formula would have a fencepost error in it. see also
{zeroth} and {off-by-one error}, and note that not all off-by-one errors are
fencepost errors. The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic
off-by-one error where N people try to sit in N - 1 chairs, but it's not a
fencepost error. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the
spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one
should count one or both ends of a row. 2. Occasionally, an error induced by
unexpectedly regular spacing of inputs, which can (for instance) screw up
your hash table.
