 FENCEPOST ERROR n. 1. The discrete equivalent of a boundary condition. Often
exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the following problem: "If you
build a fence 100 feet long with posts ten feet apart, how many posts do you
need?" (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.) For example,
suppose you have a long list or array of items, and want to process items m
through n; how many items are there? The obvious answer is n - m, but that is
off by one; the right answer is n - m + 1. A program that used the "obvious"
formula would have a fencepost error in it. see also OFF-BY-ONE ERROR, and
note that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost errors. The game of Musical
Chairs involves an off-by-one problem where N people try to sit in N-1
chairs, but it's not a fencepost error. Fencepost errors come from counting
things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting
to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row. 2.
Occasionally, an error induced by unexpectedly regular spacing of inputs,
which can (for instance) screw up your hash table.
