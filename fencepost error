 FENCEPOST ERROR (fens'post eir'@r) n. The discrete equivalent of a boundary
condition. Often exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the following
problem: "If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts ten feet apart, how
many posts do you need?" (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious
10.)
