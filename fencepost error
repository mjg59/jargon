 FENCEPOST ERROR n. 1. The discrete equivalent of a boundary condition. Often
exhibited in programs by iterative loops. From the following problem: "If you
build a fence 100 feet long with posts ten feet apart, how many posts do you
need?" (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.) 2.
Occasionally, an error induced by unexpectedly regular spacing of inputs,
which can (for instance) screw up your hash table. see also OFF-BY-ONE ERROR.
