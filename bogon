 BOGON (bo'gon) [by analogy with proton/electron/neutron, but doubtless
reinforced by the similarity to "Vogon"] n. 1. The elementary particle of
bogosity (see QUANTUM BOGODYNAMICS). For instance, "the ethernet is emitting
bogons again," meaning that it is broken or acting in an erratic or bogus
fashion. 2. A query packet sent from a TCP/IP domain resolver to a root
server, having the reply bit set instead of the query bit. 3. Any bogus or
incorrectly formed packet sent on a network. 4. By extension, used to refer
metasyntactically to any bogus thing, such as "I'd like to go to lunch with
you but I've got to go to the weekly staff bogon."
