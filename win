 :win: [MIT] 1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if no unexpected conditions
arise, or (especially) if it sufficiently {robust} to take exceptions in
stride. 2. n. Success, or a specific instance thereof. A pleasing outcome. A
{feature}. Emphatic forms: `moby win', `super win', `hyper-win' (often used
interjectively as a reply). For some reason `suitable win' is also common at
MIT, usually in reference to a satisfactory solution to a problem. Oppose
{lose}; see also {big win}, which isn't quite just an intensification of
`win'.
