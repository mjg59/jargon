 :win: [MIT; now common everywhere] 1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if no
unexpected conditions arise, or (especially) if it is sufficiently {robust}
to take exceptions in stride. 2. n. Success, or a specific instance thereof.
A pleasing outcome. "So it turned out I could use a {lexer} generator instead
of hand-coding my own pattern recognizer. What a win!" Emphatic forms: moby
win, super win, hyper-win (often used interjectively as a reply). For some
reason suitable win is also common at MIT, usually in reference to a
satisfactory solution to a problem. Oppose {lose}; see also {big win}, which
isn't quite just an intensification of win.
