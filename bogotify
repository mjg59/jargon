 BOGOTIFY /boh-go't@-fie/ vt. To make or become bogus. A program that has
been changed so many times as to become completely disorganized has become
bogotified. If you tighten a nut too hard and strip the threads on the bolt,
the bolt has become bogotified and you'd better not use it any more. This
coinage led to the notional AUTOBOGOTIPHOBIA (aw'to-boh-got'@-foh`bee-uh) n.,
defined as the fear of becoming bogotified; but is not clear that the latter
has ever been `live' slang rather than a self-conscious joke in jargon about
jargon.
