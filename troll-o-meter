 :Troll-O-Meter: n. Common Usenet jargon for a notional instrument used to
measure the quality of a Usenet {troll}. "Come on, everyone! If the above
doesn't set off the Troll-O-Meter, we're going to have to get him to run
around with a big blinking sign saying `I am a troll, I'm only in it for the
controversy and flames' and shooting random gobs of Jell-O(tm) at us before
the point is proven." Mentions of the Troll-O-Meter are often accompanied by
an ASCII picture of an arrow pointing at a numeric scale. Compare
{bogometer}, {Indent-o-Meter}.
