 :CrApTeX: /krap'tekh/ /n./ [University of York, England] Term of abuse used
to describe TeX and LaTeX when they don't work (when used by TeXhackers), or
all the time (by everyone else). The non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it
because it is more verbose than other formatters (e.g. {{troff}}) and because
(particularly if the standard Computer Modern fonts are used) it generates
vast output files. see {religious issues}, {{TeX}}.
