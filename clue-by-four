 :clue-by-four: [Usenet: portmanteau, clue + two-by-four] The notional stick
with which one whacks an aggressively clueless person. This term derives from
a western American folk saying about training a mule "First, you got to hit
him with a two-by-four. That's to get his attention." The clue-by-four is a
close relative of the {LART}. Syn. clue stick. This metaphor is commonly
elaborated; your editor once heard a hacker say "I smite you with the great
sword Cluebringer!"
