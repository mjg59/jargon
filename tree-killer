 :tree-killer: /n./ [Sun] 1. A printer. 2. A person who wastes paper. This
epithet should be interpreted in a broad sense; `wasting paper' includes the
production of {spiffy} but {content-free} documents. Thus, most {suit}s are
tree-killers. The negative loading of this term may reflect the epithet
`tree-killer' applied by Treebeard the Ent to the Orcs in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" (see also {elvish}, {elder days}).
