 :tree-killer: n. [Sun] 1. A printer. 2. A person who wastes paper. This
epithet should be interpreted in a broad sense; `wasting paper' includes the
production of {spiffy} but {content-free} documents. Thus, most {suit}s are
tree-killers. It is likely that both senses derive their flavor from the
epithet `tree-killer' applied by Treebeard the Ent to the Orcs in J.R.R.
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. see also {elvish}, {elder days}, and especially
{dead-tree version}.
