 :lamer: n.[originally among Amiga fans] 1. Synonym for {luser}, not used
much by hackers but common among {warez d00dz}, crackers, and {phreaker}s. A
person who downloads much, but who never uploads. (Also known as `leecher').
Oppose {elite}. Has the same connotations of self-conscious elitism that use
of {luser} does among hackers. 2. Someone who tries to crack a BBS. 3.
Someone who annoys the sysop or other BBS users - for instance, by posting
lots of silly messages, uploading virus-ridden software, frequently dropping
carrier, etc. Crackers also use it to refer to cracker {wannabee}s. In phreak
culture, a lamer is one who scams codes off others rather than doing cracks
or really understanding the fundamental concepts. In {warez d00dz} culture,
where the ability to wave around cracked commercial software within days of
(or before) release to the commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer
might try to upload garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in
this context is read as a few years to anything older than 3 days). `Lamer'
is also much used in the IRC world in a similar sense to the above. This term
originated among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s. It was popularized there by
Lamer Exterminator', the most famous and feared Amiga virus ever, which
gradually corrupted non-write-protected floppy disks with bad sectors. The
bad sectors, when looked at, where overwritten with the following text:
'LAMER! LAMER! LAMER! LAMER! (x1000)'
