 :lamer: /n./ [prob. originated in skateboarder slang] Synonym for {luser},
not used much by hackers but common among {warez d00dz}, crackers, and
{phreaker}s. Oppose {elite}. Has the same connotations of self-conscious
elitism that use of {luser} does among hackers. Crackers also use it to refer
to cracker {wannabee}s. In phreak culture, a lamer is one who scams codes off
others rather than doing cracks or really understanding the fundamental
concepts. In {warez d00dz} culture, where the ability to wave around cracked
commercial software within days of (or before) release to the commercial
market is much esteemed, the lamer might try to upload garbage or shareware
or something incredibly old (old in this context is read as a few years to
anything older than 3 days).
