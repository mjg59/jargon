 :Brooks's Law: prov. "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it
later" -- a result of the fact that the expected advantage from splitting
development work among N programmers is O(N) (that is, proportional to N),
but the complexity and communications cost associated with coordinating and
then merging their work is O(N^2) (that is, proportional to the square of N).
The quote is from Fred Brooks, a manager of IBM's OS/360 project and author
of The Mythical Man-Month (Addison-Wesley, 1975, ISBN 0-201-00650-2), an
excellent early book on software engineering. The myth in question has been
most tersely expressed as "Programmer time is fungible" and Brooks
established conclusively that it is not. Hackers have never forgotten his
advice (though it's not the whole story; see {bazaar}); too often,
{management} still does. see also {creationism}, {second-system effect},
{optimism}.
