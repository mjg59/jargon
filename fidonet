 :FidoNet: n. A worldwide hobbyist network of personal computers which
exchanges mail, discussion groups, and files. Founded in 1984 and originally
consisting only of IBM PCs and compatibles, FidoNet now includes such diverse
machines as Apple ][s, Ataris, Amigas, and Unix systems. For years FidoNet
actually grew faster than Usenet, but the advent of cheap Internet access
probably means its days are numbered. In mid-2001 Fidonet has approximately
15K nodes, down from 38K in 1996 -- and most of those are probably
single-user machines rather than the thriving BBSes of yore.
