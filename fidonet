 :FidoNet: n. A worldwide hobbyist network of personal computers which
exchanges mail, discussion groups, and files. Founded in 1984 and originally
consisting only of IBM PCs and compatibles, FidoNet now includes such diverse
machines as Apple ][s, Ataris, Amigas, and Unix systems. Though it is much
younger than {Usenet}, FidoNet is already (in early 1991) a significant
fraction of Usenet's size at some 8000 systems.
