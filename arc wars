 :arc wars: [primarily MSDOS] n. {holy wars} over which archiving program one
should use. The first arc war was sparked when System Enhancement Associates
(SEA) sued PKWare for copyright and trademark infringement on its ARC
program. PKWare's PKARC outperformed ARC on both compression and speed while
largely retaining compatibility (it introduced a new compression type that
could be disabled for backward-compatibility). PKWare settled out of court to
avoid enormous legal costs (both SEA and PKWare are small companies); as part
of the settlement, the name of PKARC was changed to PKPAK. The public
backlash against SEA for bringing suit helped to hasten the demise of ARC as
a standard when PKWare and others introduced new, incompatible archivers with
better compression algorithms.
