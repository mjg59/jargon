 :alt: /awlt/ 1. n. The alt shift key on an IBM PC or {clone}. 2. n. The
`clover' or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals
that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also {feature
key}). Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `alt' for the Option key. 3.
n.obs. [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for the ASCII ESC
character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling on some older terminals.
Also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). This character was almost never pronounced
`escape' on an ITS system, in {TECO}, or under TOPS-10 --- always alt, as in
"Type alt alt to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log
onto the [ITS] system"). This was probably because alt is more convenient to
say than `escape', especially when followed by another alt or a character (or
another alt *and* a character, for that matter).
