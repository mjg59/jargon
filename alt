 ALT: /awlt/ 1. n. The ALT shift key on an IBM PC or {clone}. 2. [possibly
lowercased] n. The `clover' or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term
usually reveals that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see
also {command key}). Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `ALT' for the
Option key. 3. n.obs. [PDP-10] Alternate name for the ASCII ESC character,
after the keycap labeling on some older terminals. Also `ALTMODE'. This
character was almost never pronounced "escape" on an ITS system, in {TECO},
or under TOPS-10 --- always ALT, as in "Type ALT ALT to end a TECO command"
or "ALT U onto the system" (for "log onto the [ITS] system"). This was
probably because ALT is more convenient to say than "escape", especially when
followed by another ALT or a character (or another ALT *and* a character, for
that matter!). alt bit: /awlt bit/ [from alternate] adj. see {meta bit}.
