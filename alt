 :alt: /awlt/ 1. /n./ The alt shift key on an IBM PC or {clone} keyboard; see
{bucky bits}, sense 2 (though typical PC usage does not simply set the 0200
bit). 2. /n./ The `clover' or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term
usually reveals that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see
also {feature key}). Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `alt' for the
Option key (and it is so labeled on some Mac II keyboards). 3. /n.,obs/.
[PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for the ASCII ESC character
(ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling on some older terminals; also
`altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). This character was almost never pronounced `escape'
on an ITS system, in {TECO}, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt
alt to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log onto the
[ITS] system"). This usage probably arose because alt is more convenient to
say than `escape', especially when followed by another alt or a character (or
another alt *and* a character, for that matter). 3. The alt hierarchy on
Usenet, the tree of newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and
approval procedure. There is a myth, not entirely implausible, that alt is
acronymic for "anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists"; but in fact it is
simply short for "alternative".
