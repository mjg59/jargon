 :black hole: n. When a piece of email or netnews disappears mysteriously
between its origin and destination sites (that is, without returning a
{bounce message}) it is commonly said to have `fallen into a black hole'. "I
think there's a black hole at foovax!" conveys suspicion that site foovax has
been dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately (see {drop on the floor}).
The implied metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting in
itself. Compare {bit bucket}.
