 BLACK HOLE n. When a piece of email or netnews disappears mysteriously
between its origin and destination sites it is commonly said to have "fallen
into a black hole". Similarly, one might say "I think there's a black hole at
foovax!" to convey suspicion that site foovax has been dropping a lot of
stuff on the floor lately. The implied metaphor of email as interstellar
travel is interesting in itself.
