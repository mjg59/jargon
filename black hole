 :black hole: /n./ What a piece of email or netnews has fallen into if it
disappears mysteriously between its origin and destination sites (that is,
without returning a {bounce message}). "I think there's a black hole at
foovax!" conveys suspicion that site foovax has been dropping a lot of stuff
on the floor lately (see {drop on the floor}). The implied metaphor of email
as interstellar travel is interesting in itself. Compare {bit bucket}.
