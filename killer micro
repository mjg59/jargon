 :killer micro: n. [popularized by Eugene Brooks] A microprocessor-based
machine that infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf.
Often heard in "No one will survive the attack of the killer micros!", the
battle cry of the downsizers. Used esp. of RISC architectures. The popularity
of the phrase `attack of the killer micros' is doubtless reinforced by the
title of the movie "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" (one of the {canonical}
examples of so-bad-it's-wonderful among hackers). This has even more {flavor}
now that killer micros have gone on the offensive not just individually (in
workstations) but in hordes (within massively parallel computers). [1996
update: Eugene Brooks was right. Since this term first entered the Jargon
File in 1990, the minicomputer has effectively vanished, the {mainframe}
sector is in deep and apparently terminal decline (with IBM but a shadow of
its former self), and even the supercomputer business has contracted into a
smaller niche. It's networked killer micros as far as the eye can see. --ESR]
