 :killer micro: n. [popularized by Eugene Brooks] A microprocessor-based
machine that infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf.
Often heard in "No one will survive the attack of the killer micros!", the
battle cry of the downsizers. Used esp. of RISC architectures. The popularity
of the phrase `attack of the killer micros' is doubtless reinforced by the
movie title "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" (one of the {canonical} examples
of so-bad-it's-wonderful among hackers). This has even more flavor now that
killer micros have gone on the offensive not just individually (in
workstations) but in hordes (within massively parallel computers).
