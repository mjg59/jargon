 :crash: 1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure. Most often said of the
{system} (q.v., sense 1), esp. of magnetic disk drives (the term originally
described what happens when the air gap of a hard disk collapses). "Three
{luser}s lost their files in last night's disk crash." A disk crash that
involves the read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a head crash, whereas the
term system crash usually, though not always, implies that the operating
system or other software was at fault. 2. v. To fail suddenly. "Has the
system just crashed?" "Something crashed the OS!" see {down}. Also used
transitively to indicate the cause of the crash (usually a person or a
program, or both). "Those idiots playing {SPACEWAR} crashed the system." 3.
vi. Sometimes said of people hitting the sack after a long {hacking run}; see
{gronk out}.
