 CRASH 1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure. Most often said of the system
(q.v., definition #1), sometimes of magnetic disk drives. "Three lusers lost
their files in last night's disk crash." A disk crash which entails the
read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and scraping off the
oxide may also be referred to as a "head crash", whereas the term "system
crash" usually, though not always, implies that the operating system or other
software was at fault. 2. vi. To fail suddenly. "Has the system just
crashed?" Also used transitively to indicate the cause of the crash (usually
a person or a program, or both). "Those idiots playing SPACEWAR crashed the
system." 3. Sometimes said of people hitting the sack after a long HACKING
RUN, see GRONK OUT.
