 :fred: /n./ 1. The personal name most frequently used as a {metasyntactic
variable} (see {foo}). Allegedly popular because it's easy for a
non-touch-typist to type on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Unlike {J. Random
Hacker} or `J. Random Loser', this name has no positive or negative loading
(but see {Mbogo, Dr. Fred}). see also {barney}. 2. An acronym for `Flipping
Ridiculous Electronic Device'; other F-verbs may be substituted for
`flipping'.
