 :fred: n. 1. The personal name most frequently used as a {metasyntactic
variable} (see {foo}). Allegedly popular because it's easy for a
non-touch-typist to type on a standard QWERTY keyboard. In Great Britain,
`fred', `jim' and `sheila' are common metasyntactic variables because their
uppercase versions were _official_ names given to the 3 memory areas that
held I/O status registers on the lovingly-remembered BBC Microcomputer! (It
is reported that SHEILA was poked the most often.) Unlike {J. Random Hacker}
or `J. Random Loser', the name `fred' has no positive or negative loading
(but see {Dr. Fred Mbogo}). see also {barney}. 2. An acronym for `Flipping
Ridiculous Electronic Device'; other F-verbs may be substituted for
`flipping'.
