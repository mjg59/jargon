 :wart: n. A small, {crock}y {feature} that sticks out of an otherwise
{clean} design. Something conspicuous for localized ugliness, especially a
special-case exception to a general rule. For example, in some versions of
`csh(1)', single quotes literalize every character inside them except `!'. In
ANSI C, the `??' syntax used for obtaining ASCII characters in a foreign
environment is a wart. see also {miswart}.
