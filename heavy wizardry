 :heavy wizardry: n. Code or designs that trade on a particularly intimate
knowledge or experience of a particular operating system or language or
complex application interface. Distinguished from {deep magic}, which trades
more on arcane theoretical knowledge. Writing device drivers is heavy
wizardry; so is interfacing to {X} (sense 2) without a toolkit. Esp.: found
in source-code comments of the form "Heavy wizardry begins here". Compare
{voodoo programming}.
