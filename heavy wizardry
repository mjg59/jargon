 HEAVY WIZARDRY n. Code or designs which trade on a particularly intimate
knowledge or experience of a particular operating system or language or
complex application interface. Distinguished from DEEP MAGIC, which trades
more on arcane *theoretical* knowledge. Writing device drivers is heavy
wizardry; so is interfacing to X (sense #2) without a toolkit. Esp. found in
comments of the form "Heavy wizardry begins here...".
