 :winner: 1. n. An unexpectedly good situation, program, programmer, or
person. "So it turned out I could use a {lexer} generator instead of
hand-coding my own pattern recognizer. What a win!" 2. `real winner': Often
sarcastic, but also used as high praise (see also the note under {user}).
"He's a real winner --- never reports a bug till he can duplicate it and send
in an example."
