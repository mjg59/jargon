 :cthulhic: /kthoolÂ´hik/, adj. Having the nature of a Cthulhu, the horrific
tentacled green monstrosity from H.P. Lovecraft's seminal horror fiction.
Cthulhu sends dreams that drive men mad, feeds on the flesh of screaming
victims rent limb from limb, and is served by a cult of degenerates. Hackers
think this describes large {proprietary} systems such as traditional
{mainframe}s, installations of SAP and Oracle, or rooms full of Windows
servers remarkably well, and the adjective is used casually. Compare
{Shub-Internet} and {crawling horror}.
