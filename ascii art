(sic)]. The pronunciation of # as `pound' is common in the U.S. but a bad
idea; {Commonwealth Hackish} has its own, rather more apposite use of `pound
sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards the £ happens to replace #; thus
Britishers sometimes call # on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the
American error). The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned commercial
practice of using a # suffix to tag pound weights on bills of lading. The
character is usually pronounced `hash' outside the U.S. There are more
culture wars over the correct pronunciation of this character than any other,
which has led to the {ha ha only serious} suggestion that it be pronounced
"shibboleth" (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or Tanakh). The `uparrow'
name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for underline are historical relics
from archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those
character positions rather than the modern punctuation characters. The `swung
dash' or `approximation' sign (?1) is not quite the same as tilde ~ in
typeset material, but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare {angle
brackets}). Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The #, $, >, and &
characters, for example, are all pronounced "hex" in different communities
because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants
(in particular, # in many assembler-programming cultures, $ in the 6502
world, > at Texas Instruments, and & on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80
machines). see also {splat}. The inability of ASCII text to correctly
represent any of the world's other major languages makes the designers'
choice of 7 bits look more and more like a serious {misfeature} as the use of
international networks continues to increase (see {software rot}). Hardware
and software from the U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII is
the universal character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is a major
irritant to people who want to use a character set suited to their own
languages. Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
`national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a smaller
subset common to all those in use. :ASCII art: n. The fine art of drawing
diagrams using the ASCII character set (mainly |, -, /, \, and +). Also known
as character graphics or ASCII graphics; see also {boxology}. Here is a
