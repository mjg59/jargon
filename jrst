 JRST /jerst/ [based on the PDP-10 jump instruction] v., obs. To suddenly
change subjects, with no intention of returning to the previous topic..
Usage: rather rare, and considered silly. "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick;
Jack jrst over the candle stick." This is even sillier. Why JRST and not
JUMP? The PDP-10 JUMP instruction means "do not jump", as explained in the
definition of AOS. The JUMPA instruction ("JUMP Always") does jump, but it
isn't quite as fast as the JRST instruction (Jump and ReSTore flags). The
instruction was used so frequently that the speed matters, so all PDP-10
hackers automatically used the faster though more obscure JRST instruction.
