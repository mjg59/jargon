 :NUXI problem: /nuk'see pro'bl*m/ n. Refers to the problem of transferring
data between machines with differing byte-order. The string `UNIX' might look
like `NUXI' on a machine with a different `byte sex' (e.g., when transferring
data from a {little-endian} to a {big-endian}, or vice-versa). see also
{middle-endian}, {swab}, and {bytesexual}.
