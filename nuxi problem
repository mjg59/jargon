 NUXI PROBLEM, THE /nuk'see pro'blm, dh@/ n. This refers to the problem of
transferring data between machines with differing byte-order. The string
"UNIX" might look like "NUXI" on a machine with a different "byte sex" (i.e.
when transferring data from a little-endian to a big endian or vice-versa).
