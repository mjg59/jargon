 :forked: adj.,vi. 1. [common after 1997, esp. in the Linux community] An
open-source software project is said to have forked or be forked when the
project group fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of
development (or, less commonly, when a third party unconnected to the project
group begins its own line of development). Forking is considered a {Bad
Thing} - not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future,
but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and
acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession,
and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a
result, major forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the fissionings of
the 386BSD group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS
split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker
folklore. 2. [Unix; uncommon; prob. influenced by a mainstream expletive]
Terminally slow, or dead. Originated when one system was slowed to a snail's
pace by an inadvertent {fork bomb}.
