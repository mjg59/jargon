 SHELL (shel) [from UNIX, now used elsewhere] n. 1. On an operating system
with a well-defined KERNEL (q.v.), the SHELL is the loadable command
interpreter program used to pass commands to the kernel. A single kernel may
support several shells with different interface styles. 2. More generally,
any interface program which mediates access to a special resource or SERVER
for convenience, efficiency or security reasons; for this meaning, the usage
is usually A SHELL AROUND whatever.
