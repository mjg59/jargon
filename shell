 :shell: [orig. {{Multics}} n. techspeak, widely propagated via UNIX] 1.
[techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass commands to an operating
system; so called because it is the part of the operating system that
interfaces with the outside world. 2. More generally, any interface program
that mediates access to a special resource or {server} for convenience,
efficiency, or security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually `a
shell around' whatever. This sort of program is also called a `wrapper'.
