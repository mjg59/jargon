 :shell: [orig. {{Multics}} /n./ techspeak, widely propagated via Unix] 1.
[techspeak] The command interpreter used to pass commands to an operating
system; so called because it is the part of the operating system that
interfaces with the outside world. 2. More generally, any interface program
that mediates access to a special resource or {server} for convenience,
efficiency, or security reasons; for this meaning, the usage is usually `a
shell around' whatever. This sort of program is also called a `wrapper'. 3. A
skeleton program, created by hand or by another program (like, say, a parser
generator), which provides the necessary {incantation}s to set up some task
and the control flow to drive it (the term {driver} is sometimes used
synonymously). The user is meant to fill in whatever code is needed to get
real work done. This usage is common in the AI and Microsoft Windows worlds,
and confuses Unix hackers.
