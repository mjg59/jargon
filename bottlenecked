 BOTTLENECKED adj. 1. Used by hackers specifically to describe hardware under
which performance is usually limited by contention for one particular
resource (such as disk, memory or processor CLOCKS); the opposite condition
is called `balanced', which is more jargon in the strict sense and may be
found in technical dictionaries. 2. Less often, applied to the software
analogue of sense #1, a slow code section or algorithm through which all
computation must pass (see also HOT SPOT).
