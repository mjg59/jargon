 :Slowlaris: /slo'-lahr-is/ n. [Usenet; poss. from the variety of prosimian
called a "slow loris". The variant `Slowlartus' is also common, related to
{LART}] Common hackish term for Solaris, Sun's System VR4 version of Unix
that came out of the standardization wars of the early 1990s. So named
because especially on older hardware, responsiveness was much less crisp than
under the preceding SunOS. Early releases of Solaris (that is, Solaris 2, as
some {marketroid}s at Sun retroactively rechristened SunOS as Solaris 1) were
quite buggy, and Sun was forced by customer demand to support SunOS for quite
some time. Newer versions are acknowledged to be among the best commercial
Unix variants in 1998, but still lose single-processor benchmarks to Sparc
{Linux}. Compare {AIDX}, {HP-SUX}, {Nominal Semidestructor}, {Telerat},
{sun-stools}.
