 ARENA [UNIX] n. The area of memory attached to a process by brk(2) and
sbrk(2) and used by malloc(3) as dynamic storage. So named from a
semi-mythical "malloc: corrupt arena" message supposedly emitted when some
early versions became terminally confused. see OVERRUN SCREW, ALIASING BUG,
MEMORY LEAK, SMASH THE STACK.
