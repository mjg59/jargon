 FLAME 1. vi. To speak incessantly and/or rabidly on some relatively
uninteresting subject or with a patently ridiculous attitude. When a
discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might tell the
participants, "Now you're just flaming" or "Stop all that flamage!" to try to
get them to cool down (so to speak). 2. To post an email message intended to
insult and provoke. FLAME ON: vi. To continue to flame. see RAVE, BURBLE. The
punning reference to Marvel comics's Human Torch has been lost as recent
usage completes the circle: "Flame on" now usually means "beginning of
flame". A USENETter who was at WPI from 1972 to 1976 adds: I am 99% certain
that the use of "FLAME" originated at WPI. Those who made a nuisance of
themselves insisting that they needed to use a TTY for "real work" came to be
known as "flaming asshole lusers". Other, particularly annoying people became
"flaming asshole ravers", which shortened to "flaming ravers", and ultimately
"flamers". I remember someone picking up on the Human Torch pun, but I don't
think "FLAME ON/OFF" was ever much used at WPI.
