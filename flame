 :flame: [at MIT, orig. from the phrase flaming asshole] 1. vi. To post an
email message intended to insult and provoke. 2. vi. To speak incessantly
and/or rabidly on some relatively uninteresting subject or with a patently
ridiculous attitude. 3. vt. Either of senses 1 or 2, directed with hostility
at a particular person or people. 4. n. An instance of flaming. When a
discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might tell the
participants "Now you're just flaming" or "Stop all that flamage!" to try to
get them to cool down (so to speak). The term may have been independently
invented at several different places. It has been reported from MIT, Carleton
College and RPI (among many other places) from as far back as 1969, and from
the University of Virginia in the early 1960s. It is possible that the
hackish sense of `flame' is much older than that. The poet Chaucer was also
what passed for a wizard hacker in his time; he wrote a treatise on the
astrolabe, the most advanced computing device of the day. In Chaucer's
Troilus and Cressida, Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of a
particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes that it's
called "the fleminge of wrecches." This phrase seems to have been intended in
context as "that which puts the wretches to flight" but was probably just as
ambiguous in Middle English as "the flaming of wretches" would be today. One
suspects that Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.
