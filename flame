 FLAME v. To speak incessantly and/or rabidly on some relatively
uninteresting subject or with a patently ridiculous attitude. FLAME ON: v. To
continue to flame. see RAVE. This punning reference to Marvel comics' Human
Torch has been lost as recent usage completes the circle: "Flame on" now
usually means "beginning of flame".
