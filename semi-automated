 :semi-automated: adj. [US Geological Survey] A procedure that has yet to be
completely automated; it still requires a smidge of clueful human
interaction. Semi-automated programs usually come with written-out operator
instructions that are worth their weight in gold -- without them, very nasty
things can happen. At USGS semi-automated programs are often referred to as
"semi-automated weapons".
