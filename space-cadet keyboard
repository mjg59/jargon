 :space-cadet keyboard: n. A now-legendary device used on MIT LISP machines,
which inspired several still-current jargon terms and influenced the design
of {EMACS}. It was equipped with no fewer than seven shift keys: four keys
for {bucky bits} (`control', `meta', `hyper', and `super') and three regular
shift keys, called `shift', `top', and `front'. Many keys had three symbols
on them: a letter and a symbol on the top, and a Greek letter on the front.
For example, the `L' key had an `L' and a two-way arrow on the top, and the
Greek letter lambda on the front. By pressing this key with the right hand
while playing an appropriate `chord' with the left hand on the shift keys,
you could get the following results: L lowercase l shift-L uppercase L
front-L l front-shift-L L top-L <=> (front and shift are ignored) And of
course each of these might also be typed with any combination of the control,
meta, hyper, and super keys. On this keyboard, you could type over 8000
different characters! This allowed the user to type very complicated
mathematical text, and also to have thousands of single-character commands at
his disposal. The keyboard of the Symbolics Lisp machine was a simplified
version, lacking Top and Front keys, that could only send about 2000
characters. Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command
meanings of that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude
obviously shaped the interface of EMACS). Other hackers, however, thought
having that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard
can require three or four hands to operate. see {bucky bits}, {cokebottle},
{double bucky}, {meta bit}, {quadruple bucky}. [symbolics-keyboard.jpg]
Simplified Symbolics version of the space-cadet keyboard (Some relatively bad
photographs of the earlier, more elaborate version are available on the
Web.). Note: early versions of this entry incorrectly identified the
space-cadet keyboard with the Knight keyboard. Though both were designed by
Tom Knight, the latter term was properly applied only to a keyboard used for
ITS on the PDP-10 and modeled on the Stanford keyboard (as described under
{bucky bits}). The true space-cadet keyboard evolved from the first Knight
keyboard. [73-05-19.png] An early {space-cadet keyboard} (The next cartoon in
