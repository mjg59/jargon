 :stone knives and bearskins: n. [from the Star Trek Classic episode "The
City on the Edge of Forever"] A term traditionally used to describe (and
deprecate) computing environments that are grotesquely primitive in light of
what is known about good ways to design things. As in "Don't get too used to
the facilities here. Once you leave SAIL it's stone knives and bearskins as
far as the eye can see". Compare {steam-powered}.
