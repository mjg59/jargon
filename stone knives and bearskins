 :stone knives and bearskins: [ITS, prob. from the Star Trek Classic episode
"The City on the Edge of Forever"] n. A term traditionally used by {ITS} fans
to describe (and deprecate) computing environments they regard as less
advanced, with the (often correct) implication that said environments were
grotesquely primitive in light of what is known about good ways to design
things. As in "Don't get too used to the facilities here. Once you leave MIT
it's stone knives and bearskins as far as the eye can see". Compare
{steam-powered}.
