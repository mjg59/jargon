 :wizard hat: n. [also, after Terry Pratchett, `pointy hat'] Notional
headgear worn by whoever is the {wizard} in a particular context. The
implication is that it's a transferable role. "Talk to Alice, she's wearing
the TCP/IP wizard hat while Bob is on vacation." This metaphor is
sufficiently live that one may actually see hackers miming the act of putting
on, taking off, or transferring a phantom hat. see also {pointy hat}, compare
{patch pumpkin}.
