 FEEP 1. n. The soft bell of a display terminal (except for a VT-52!); a
beep. 2. v. To cause the display to make a feep sound. TTY's do not have
feeps. Alternate forms: BEEP, BLEEP, or just about anything suitably onomato-
poeic. The term BREEDLE is sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal
bleepers are not particularly "soft" (they sound more like the musical
equivalent of sticking out one's tongue). The "feeper" on a VT-52 has been
compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears.
