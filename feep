 :feep: /feep/ 1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound of a display terminal
(except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the microcomputer world seems to
prefer {beep}). 2. vi. To cause the display to make a feep sound. ASR-33s
(the original TTYs) do not feep; they have mechanical bells that ring.
Alternate forms: {beep}, `bleep', or just about anything suitably
onomatopoeic. (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip Shoe, uses the word `eep'
for sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this is perhaps the
closest written approximation yet.) The term `breedle' was sometimes heard at
SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not particularly soft (they sound more
like the musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close
approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek communicator's beep lasting
for five seconds). The `feeper' on a VT-52 has been compared to the sound of
a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. see also {ding}.
