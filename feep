 FEEP /feep/ 1. n. The soft bell of a display terminal (except for a VT-52!);
a beep. 2. vi. To cause the display to make a feep sound. TTY's do not have
feeps; they have mechanical bells that ring. Alternate forms: BEEP, BLEEP, or
just about anything suitably onomatopoeic. (Jeff Macnelly, in his comic strip
`Shoe', uses the word `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video
games; this is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.) The term
BREEDLE was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not
particularly "soft" (they sound more like the musical equivalent of a
raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close approximation, imagine the sound of a
Star Trek communicator's beep lasting for five seconds.). The "feeper" on a
VT-52 has been compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. see
