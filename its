 ITS: /ie-tee-ess/ n. 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential but
highly idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-10s at MIT and long
used at the MIT AI lab; much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS folklore.
After about 1982, most actual work was shifted to newer machines, with the
remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker
community. The shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the
end of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see {high
moby}). The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is maintaining one `live'
ITS site at its computer museum (right next to the only TOPS-10 system still
on the Internet), so ITS is still alleged to hold the record for OS in
longest continuous `use'. see Appendix A. 2. A mythical image of operating
system perfection worshipped by a bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time
hackers and ex-users (see {troglodyte}, sense #2). ITS worshippers manage
somehow to continue believing that an OS that supported only character I/O
and monocase 6-character filenames in one directory per account remains
superior to today's state of commercial art (their venom against UNIX is
particularly intense). see also {holy wars}, {Weenix}.
