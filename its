 :ITS:: /I-T-S/ n. 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential but
highly idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT
and long used at the MIT AI Lab. Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS
folklore, and to have been `an ITS hacker' qualifies one instantly as an
old-timer of the most venerable sort. ITS pioneered many important
innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines and
terminal-independent I/O. After about 1982, most actual work was shifted to
newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as a hobby and
service to the hacker community. The shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine
in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning
nationwide (see {high moby}). The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
maintaining one `live' ITS site at its computer museum (right next to the
only TOPS-10 system still on the Internet), so ITS is still alleged to hold
the record for OS in longest continuous use (however, {{WAITS}} is a credible
rival for this palm). see {appendix A}. 2. A mythical image of
operating-system perfection worshiped by a bizarre, fervent retro-cult of
old-time hackers and ex-users (see {troglodyte}, sense 2). ITS worshipers
manage somehow to continue believing that an OS maintained by
assembly-language hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character
filenames in one directory per account remains superior to today's state of
commercial art (their venom against UNIX is particularly intense). see also
{holy wars}, {Weenix}.
