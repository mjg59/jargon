 ITS (ie-tee-ess) n. Incompatible Time-Sharing System, an influential but
highly idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-10s at MIT and long
used at the MIT AI lab; much AI-hacker slang derives from ITS folklore. After
about 1982 most actual work was shifted to newer machines, with the remaining
ITS boxes run essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community. The
shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era
and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide. see Appendix B.
