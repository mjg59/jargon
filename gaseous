 :gaseous: adj. Deserving of being {gas}sed. Disseminated by Geoff Goodfellow
while at SRI; became particularly popular after the Moscone-Milk killings in
San Francisco, when it was learned that the defendant Dan White (a politician
who had supported Proposition 7) would get the gas chamber under Proposition
7 if convicted of first-degree murder (he was eventually convicted of
manslaughter).
