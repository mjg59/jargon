 WEDGED adj. 1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is
different from having CRASHED. If the system has crashed, then it has become
totally non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do
something but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things,
but not be fully operational. For example, the system may become wedged if
the disk controller fries; there are some things you can do without using the
disks, but not many. Being wedged is slightly milder than being HUNG. Also
see GRONK, LOCKED UP, HOSED. 2. This term is sometimes used as a synonym for
DEADLOCKED (q.v). 3. Often refers to humans suffering misconceptions. 4.
[UNIX] Specifically used to describe the state of a TTY left in a losing
state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one that has messed with the
line discipline in some obscure way. 5. WEDGITUDE (wedj'i-tood) n. The
quality or state of being wedged.
