 :wedged: [from a common description of recto-cranial inversion] adj. 1. To
be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is different from having
crashed. If the system has crashed, then it has become totally
non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do something but
cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things, but not be
fully operational. For example, a process may become wedged if it {deadlock}s
with another (but not all instances of wedging are deadlocks). see also
{gronk}, {locked up}, {hosed}. Describes a {deadlock}ed condition. 2. Often
refers to humans suffering misconceptions. "He's totally wedged --- he's
convinced that he can levitate through meditation." 3. [UNIX] Specifically
used to describe the state of a TTY left in a losing state by abort of a
screen-oriented program or one that has messed with the line discipline in
some obscure way.
