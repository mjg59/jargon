 :wedged: adj. 1. To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is
different from having crashed. If the system has crashed, it has become
totally non-functioning. If the system is wedged, it is trying to do
something but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few things,
but not be fully operational. For example, a process may become wedged if it
{deadlock}s with another (but not all instances of wedging are deadlocks).
see also {gronk}, {locked up}, {hosed}. 2. Often refers to humans suffering
misconceptions. "He's totally wedged -- he's convinced that he can levitate
through meditation." 3. [Unix] Specifically used to describe the state of a
TTY left in a losing state by abort of a screen-oriented program or one that
has messed with the line discipline in some obscure way. There is some
dispute over the origin of this term. It is usually thought to derive from a
common description of recto-cranial inversion; however, it may actually have
originated with older `hot-press' printing technology in which physical type
elements were locked into type frames with wedges driven in by mallets. Once
this had been done, no changes in the typesetting for that page could be
made.
