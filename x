(note that a Unix hacker might write these as 680[0-4]0 and 80[1-4]86 or
680?0 and 80?86 respectively; see {glob}). 2. [after the name of an earlier
window system called `W'] An over-sized, over-featured, over-engineered and
incredibly over-complicated window system developed at MIT and widely used on
