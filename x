 X (eks) Used in various speech and writing contexts in roughly its algebraic
sense of "unknown within a set defined by context" (compare `N'). Thus: the
abbreviation 680x0 stands for 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030 or 68040, and 80x86
stands for 80186, 80286 80386 or 80486 (note that a UNIX hacker might write
these as 680[01234]0 and 80[1234]86 or 680?00 and 80?86 respectively, see
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS).
