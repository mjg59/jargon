 :deep magic: n. [poss. from C. S. Lewis's Narnia books] An awesomely arcane
technique central to a program or system, esp. one neither generally
published nor available to hackers at large (compare {black art}); one that
could only have been composed by a true {wizard}. Compiler optimization
techniques and many aspects of {OS} design used to be {deep magic}; many
techniques in cryptography, signal processing, graphics, and AI still are.
Compare {heavy wizardry}. Esp.: found in comments of the form "Deep magic
begins here...". Compare {voodoo programming}.
