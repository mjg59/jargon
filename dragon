 :dragon: n. [MIT] A program similar to a {daemon}, except that it is not
invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to perform various
secondary tasks. A typical example would be an accounting program, which
keeps track of who is logged in, accumulates load-average statistics, etc.
Under ITS, many terminals displayed a list of people logged in, where they
were, what they were running, etc., along with some random picture (such as a
unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise), which was generated by the `name
dragon'. Usage: rare outside MIT --- under UNIX and most other OSes this
would be called a `background demon' or {daemon}. The best-known UNIX example
of a dragon is `cron(1)'. At SAIL, they called this sort of thing a
`phantom'.
