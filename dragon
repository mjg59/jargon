 DRAGON [ITS; UNIX calls this a DAEMON or DEMON] n. A program similar to a
DAEMON, except that it doesn't sit around waiting for something to happen,
but is instead used by the system to perform various useful tasks that just
have to be done periodically. A typical example would be an accounting
program that accumulates statistics, keeps track of who is logged in, and so
on. Another example: most timesharing systems have several terminals, and at
any given time some are in use and some are sitting idle; the idle ones
usually sit there with some idiotic message on their screens, such as "Logged
off.", from the last time someone used it. The ITS timesharing system at MIT
puts these idle terminals to good use by displaying useful information on
them, such as who is using the computer, where they are, what they're doing,
what their telephone numbers are, and so on, along with other information
such as pretty pictures (the picture collection included a unicorn, Snoopy,
and the U.S.S. Enterprise from Star Trek). All this information was displayed
on idle terminals by the `name dragon', so called because it originally
printed just the names of the users. (That it now shows all kinds of things,
including useless though pretty pictures, is an example of CREEPING
FEATURISM.) The name dragon is a program started up by the system, and it
runs about every five minutes and updates the information on all idle
terminals.
