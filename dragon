 DRAGON n. (MIT) A program similar to a "daemon" (q.v.), except that it is
not invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to perform various
secondary tasks. A typical example would be an accounting program, which
keeps track of who is logged in, accumulates load- average statistics, etc.
At MIT, all free TV's display a list of people logged in, where they are,
what they're running, etc. along with some random picture (such as a unicorn,
Snoopy, or the Enterprise) which is generated by the "NAME DRAGON." see
PHANTOM.
