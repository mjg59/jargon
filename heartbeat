 :heartbeat: n. 1. The signal emitted by a Level 2 Ethernet transceiver at
the end of every packet to show that the collision-detection circuit is still
connected. 2. A periodic synchronization signal used by software or hardware,
such as a bus clock or a periodic interrupt. 3. The `natural' oscillation
frequency of a computer's clock crystal, before frequency division down to
the machine's clock rate. 4. A signal emitted at regular intervals by
software to demonstrate that it is still alive. Sometimes hardware is
designed to reboot the machine if it stops hearing a heartbeat. see also
