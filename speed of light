 :speed of light: The absolutely fastest a particular algorithm or
application could be implemented, given a set of constraints that are assumed
to be unchangeable. For example, "This would take 60 microseconds without any
processing whatsoever, so that's the speed of light." However, as one
brilliant hacker once commented: "Remember that the speed of light only is
constant if you can't redesign the universe."
