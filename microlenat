 :microLenat: /mi:`-kroh-len'-*t/ n. The unit of {bogosity}. Consensus is
that this is the largest unit practical for everyday use. The microLenat,
originally invented by David Jefferson, was promulgated as an attack against
noted computer scientist Doug Lenat by a {tenured graduate student} at CMU.
Doug had failed the student on an important exam because the student gave
only "AI is bogus" as his answer to the questions. The slur is generally
considered unmerited, but it has become a running gag nevertheless. Some of
Doug's friends argue that _of course_ a microLenat is bogus, since it is only
one millionth of a Lenat. Others have suggested that the unit should be
redesignated after the grad student, as the microReid.
