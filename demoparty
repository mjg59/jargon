 :demoparty: n. [{demoscene}] Aboveground descendant of the {copyparty}, with
emphasis shifted away from software piracy and towards {compo}s. Smaller
demoparties, for 100 persons or less, are held quite often, sometimes even
once a month, and usually last for one to two days. On the other end of the
scale, huge demo parties are held once a year (and four of these have grown
very large and occur annually -- Assembly in Finland, The Party in Denmark,
The Gathering in Norway, and NAID somewhere in north America). These parties
usually last for three to five days, have room for 3000-5000 people, and have
a party network with connection to the internet.
