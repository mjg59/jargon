 :virtual reality: /n./ 1. Computer simulations that use 3-D graphics and
devices such as the Dataglove to allow the user to interact with the
simulation. see {cyberspace}. 2. A form of network interaction incorporating
aspects of role-playing games, interactive theater, improvisational comedy,
and `true confessions' magazines. In a virtual reality forum (such as
Usenet's alt.callahans newsgroup or the {MUD} experiments on Internet),
interaction between the participants is written like a shared novel complete
with scenery, `foreground characters' that may be personae utterly unlike the
people who write them, and common `background characters' manipulable by all
parties. The one iron law is that you may not write irreversible changes to a
character without the consent of the person who `owns' it. Otherwise anything
goes. see {bamf}, {cyberspace}, {teledildonics}.
