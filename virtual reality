 VIRTUAL REALITY n. A form of network interaction incorporating aspects of
role-playing games, interactive theater, improvisational comedy and "true
confessions" magazines. In a "virtual reality" forum (such as USENET's
alt.callahans newsgroup or the MUD experiments on Internet) interaction
between the participants is written like a shared novel complete with
scenery, "foreground characters" which may be personae utterly unlike the
people who write them, and common "background characters" manipulable by all
parties. The one iron law is that you may not write irreversible changes to a
character without the consent of the person who "owns" it. Otherwise anything
goes. see BAMF.
