 :front end: n. 1. An intermediary computer that does set-up and filtering
for another (usually more powerful but less friendly) machine (a back end).
2. What you're talking to when you have a conversation with someone who is
making replies without paying attention. "Look at the dancing elephants!"
"Uh-huh." "Do you know what I just said?" "Sorry, you were talking to the
front end." 3. Software that provides an interface to another program
`behind' it, which may not be as user-friendly. Probably from analogy with
hardware front-ends (see sense 1) that interfaced with mainframes.
