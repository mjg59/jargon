 :phase: 1. n. The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect to
the standard 24-hour cycle; a useful concept among people who often work at
night and/or according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to change
one's phase by as much as 6 hours per day on a regular basis. "What's your
phase?" "I've been getting in about 8 P.M. lately, but I'm going to {wrap
around} to the day schedule by Friday." A person who is roughly 12 hours out
of phase is sometimes said to be in `night mode'. (The term `day mode' is
also (but less frequently) used, meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or, more
likely, 10 to 6).) The act of altering one's cycle is called `changing
phase'; `phase shifting' has also been recently reported from Caltech. 2.
`change phase the hard way': To stay awake for a very long time in order to
get into a different phase. 3. `change phase the easy way': To stay asleep,
etc. However, some claim that either staying awake longer or sleeping longer
is easy, and that it is _shortening_ your day or night that is really hard
(see {wrap around}). The `jet lag' that afflicts travelers who cross many
time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct causes: the strain of
travel per se, and the strain of changing phase. Hackers who suddenly find
that they must change phase drastically in a short period of time,
particularly the hard way, experience something very like jet lag without
traveling.
