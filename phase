 PHASE 1. n. The phase of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the
standard 24-hour cycle. This is a useful concept among people who often work
at night according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to change one's
phase by as much as six hours/day on a regular basis. "What's your phase?"
"I've been getting in about 8 PM lately, but I'm going to work around to the
day schedule by Friday." A person who is roughly 12 hours out of phase is
sometimes said to be in "night mode". (The term "day mode" is also , but less
frequently, used, meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or more likely 10 to 6)) 2.
CHANGE PHASE THE HARD WAY: To stay awake for a very long time in order to get
into a different phase. 3. CHANGE PHASE THE EASY WAY: To stay asleep etc.
However, some claim that either staying awake longer or sleeping longer is
easy, an that it's *shortening* your day or night that's hard. The phenomenon
of "jet lag" that afflicts travelers who cross many time-zone boundaries may
be attributed to two distinct causes: the strain of travel per se, and the
strain of changing phase. Hackers who suddenly find that they must change
phase drastically in a short period of time, particularly the hard way,
experience something very like jet lag without travelling.
