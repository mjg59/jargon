 PHASE (fayz) 1. n. The phase of one's waking-sleeping schedule with respect
to the standard 24-hour cycle. This is a useful concept among people who
often work at night according to no fixed schedule. It is not uncommon to
change one's phase by as much as six hours/day on a regular basis. "What's
your phase?" "I've been getting in about 8 PM lately, but I'm going to work
around to the day schedule by Friday." A person who is roughly 12 hours out
of phase is sometimes said to be in "night mode". (The term "day mode" is
also used, but less frequently.) 2. CHANGE PHASE THE HARD WAY: To stay awake
for a very long time in order to get into a different phase. 3. CHANGE PHASE
THE EASY WAY: To stay asleep etc.
