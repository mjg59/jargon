 :nuke: /n[y]ook/ /vt./ 1. To intentionally delete the entire contents of a
given directory or storage volume. "On Unix, `rm -r /usr' will nuke
everything in the usr filesystem." Never used for accidental deletion. Oppose
{blow away}. 2. Syn. for {dike}, applied to smaller things such as files,
features, or code sections. Often used to express a final verdict. "What do
you want me to do with that 80-meg {wallpaper} file?" "Nuke it." 3. Used of
processes as well as files; nuke is a frequent verbal alias for `kill -9' on
Unix. 4. On IBM PCs, a bug that results in {fandango on core} can trash the
operating system, including the FAT (the in-core copy of the disk block
chaining information). This can utterly scramble attached disks, which are
then said to have been `nuked'. This term is also used of analogous lossages
on Macintoshes and other micros without memory protection.
