 :zero: vt. 1. To set to 0. Usually said of small pieces of data, such as
bits or words (esp. in the construction `zero out'). 2. To erase; to discard
all data from. Said of disks and directories, where `zeroing' need not
involve actually writing zeroes throughout the area being zeroed. One may
speak of something being `logically zeroed' rather than being `physically
zeroed'. see {scribble}.
