 :OS/2: /O S too/, n. The anointed successor to MS-DOS for Intel 286- and
386-based micros; proof that IBM/Microsoft couldn't get it right the second
time, either. Often called `Half-an-OS'. Mentioning it is usually good for a
cheap laugh among hackers -- the design was so {baroque}, and the
implementation of 1.x so bad, that three years after introduction you could
still count the major {app}s shipping for it on the fingers of two hands --
in unary. The 2.x versions were said to have improved somewhat, and informed
hackers rated them superior to Microsoft Windows (an endorsement which,
however, could easily be construed as damning with faint praise). In the
mid-1990s IBM put OS/2 on life support, refraining from killing it outright
purely for internal political reasons; by 1999 the success of {Linux} had
effectively ended any possibility of a renaissance. see {monstrosity},
{cretinous}, {second-system effect}.
