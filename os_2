 :OS/2: /O S too/ /n./ The anointed successor to MS-DOS for Intel 286- and
386-based micros; proof that IBM/Microsoft couldn't get it right the second
time, either. Often called `Half-an-OS'. Mentioning it is usually good for a
cheap laugh among hackers --- the design was so {baroque}, and the
implementation of 1.x so bad, that 3 years after introduction you could still
count the major {app}s shipping for it on the fingers of two hands -- in
unary. The 2.x versions are said to have improved somewhat, and informed
hackers now rate them superior to Microsoft Windows (an endorsement which,
however, could easily be construed as damning with faint praise). see
{monstrosity}, {cretinous}, {second-system effect}.
