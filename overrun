 :overrun: n. 1. [techspeak] Term for a frequent consequence of data arriving
faster than it can be consumed, esp. in serial line communications. For
example, at 9600 baud there is almost exactly one character per millisecond,
so if your {silo} can hold only two characters and the machine takes longer
than 2 msec to get to service the interrupt, at least one character will be
lost. 2. Also applied to non-serial-I/O communications. "I forgot to pay my
electric bill due to mail overrun." "Sorry, I got four phone calls in 3
minutes last night and lost your message to overrun." When {thrash}ing at
tasks, the next person to make a request might be told "Overrun!" Compare
{firehose syndrome}. 3. More loosely, may refer to a {buffer overflow} not
necessarily related to processing time (as in {overrun screw}).
