 :wall time: /n./ (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world' time (what the
clock on the wall shows), as opposed to the system clock's idea of time. 2.
The real running time of a program, as opposed to the number of {tick}s
required to execute it (on a timesharing system these always differ, as no
one program gets all the ticks, and on multiprocessor systems with good
thread support one may get more processor time than real time).
