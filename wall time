 :wall time: n. (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world' time (what the clock
on the wall shows), as opposed to the system clock's idea of time. 2. The
real running time of a program, as opposed to the number of {clocks} required
to execute it (on a timesharing system these will differ, as no one program
gets all the {clocks}, and on multiprocessor systems with good thread support
one may get more processor clocks than real-time clocks).
