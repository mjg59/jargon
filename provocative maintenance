 :provocative maintenance: /n./ [common ironic mutation of `preventive
maintenance'] Actions performed upon a machine at regularly scheduled
intervals to ensure that the system remains in a usable state. So called
because it is all too often performed by a {field servoid} who doesn't know
what he is doing; such `maintenance' often *induces* problems, or otherwise
results in the machine's remaining in an *un*usable state for an
indeterminate amount of time. see also {scratch monkey}.
