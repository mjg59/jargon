 BREAK v. 1. To cause to be broken (in any sense). "Your latest patch to the
editor broke the paragraph commands." 2. (of a program) To stop temporarily,
so that it may be examined for debugging purposes. The place where it stops
is a "breakpoint". 3. To send an RS-232 "break" (125 msec. of line high) over
a serial comm line. 4. [UNIX] To strike whatever key currently causes the tty
driver to send SIGINT to the current process. Normally "break" (sense 3) or
delete does this.
