 :break: 1. vt. To cause to be {broken} (in any sense). "Your latest patch to
the editor broke the paragraph commands." 2. v. (of a program) To stop
temporarily, so that it may debugged. The place where it stops is a
`breakpoint'. 3. [techspeak] vi. To send an RS-232 break (two character
widths of line high) over a serial comm line. 4. [Unix] vi. To strike
whatever key currently causes the tty driver to send SIGINT to the current
process. Normally, break (sense 3), delete or {control-C} does this. 5.
`break break' may be said to interrupt a conversation (this is an example of
verb doubling). This usage comes from radio communications, which in turn
probably came from landline telegraph/teleprinter usage, as badly abused in
the Citizen's Band craze of the early 1980s.
