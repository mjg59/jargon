 :computer geek: /n./ 1. One who eats (computer) bugs for a living. One who
fulfills all the dreariest negative stereotypes about hackers: an asocial,
malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a cheese
grater. Cannot be used by outsiders without implied insult to all hackers;
compare black-on-black usage of `nigger'. A computer geek may be either a
fundamentally clueless individual or a proto-hacker in {larval stage}. Also
called `turbo nerd', `turbo geek'. see also {propeller head},
{clustergeeking}, {geek out}, {wannabee}, {terminal junkie}, {spod},
{weenie}. 2. Some self-described computer geeks use this term in a positive
sense and protest sense 1 (this seems to be a post-1990 development).
