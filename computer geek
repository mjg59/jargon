 COMPUTER GEEK (kuhm-pyoo-tr geek) n. One who eats [computer] bugs for a
living. One who fulfills all of the dreariest negative stereotypes about
hackers: an asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all the
personality of a cheese grater. Cannot be used by outsiders without implied
insult to all hackers; compare black-on-black usage of "nigger". A computer
geek may be either a fundamentally clueless individual or a true-hacker in
LARVAL STAGE. Also called TURBO NERD, TURBO GEEK. see also CLUSTERGEEKING.
