 :chawmp: /n./ [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a machine
word). This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late 1970s/early 1980s;
it is said to have been archaic then, and may now be obsolete. It was coined
in revolt against the promiscuous use of `word' for anything between 16 and
32 bits; `word' has an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made
the overloading intolerable. For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled `gawble'
or possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or 48 bits (presumably a
full machine word, but our sources are unclear on this). These terms are more
easily understood if one thinks of them as faithful phonetic spellings of
`chomp' and `gobble' pronounced in a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.
