volleyball. The now-demolished {D. C. Power Lab} building used by the
Stanford AI Lab in the 1970s had a volleyball court on the front lawn. From 5
P.M. to 7 P.M. was the scheduled maintenance time for the computer, so every
afternoon at 5 would come over the intercom the cry: "Now hear this: bounce,
bounce!", followed by Brian McCune loudly bouncing a volleyball on the floor
outside the offices of known volleyballers. 3. To engage in sexual
intercourse; prob. from the expression `bouncing the mattress', but
influenced by Roo's psychosexually loaded "Try bouncing me, Tigger!" from the
"Winnie-the-Pooh" books. Compare {boink}. 4. To casually reboot a system in
order to clear up a transient problem. Reported primarily among {VMS} users.
