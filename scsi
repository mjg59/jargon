 SCSI: /ess see ess ie/ n. Small Computer System Interface is a system-level
interface between a computer and intelligent devices. Typically annotated in
literature with `sexy' (/sek'see/) and `scuzzy' (/skuhz'zee/) as
pronunciation guides...the latter being the predominating form, much to the
dismay of the designers and their marketing people. search-and-destroy mode:
n. Hackerism for the search-and-replace facility in an editor, so called
because an incautiously chosen match pattern can cause {infinite} damage.
second-system effect: n. (sometimes, more euphoniously,
`second-system-syndrome'.) When designing the successor to a relatively
small, elegant, and successful system, there is a tendency to become
grandiose in one's success and design an {elephantine} feature-laden
monstrosity. The term was first used by Fred Brooks in his classic book `The
Mythical Man-Month'. It described the jump from a set of nice, simple,
operating monitors on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360 series. A
similar effect can also happen in an evolving system; see {creeping
elegance}, {creaping featurism}. see also {Multics}. segfault: n.,vi. Syn for
{segment}, {seggie}. seggie: /seg'ee/ [UNIX] n. Shorthand for {segmentation
fault} reported from Britain. segment: /seg'ment/ vi. To experience a
{segmentation fault}. Confusingly, this is often accented on the first
syllable rather than on the second as for mainstream v. segment; this is
because it's actually a noun shorthand that has been verbed. segmentation
fault: n. [UNIX] 1. Error in which a running program attempts to access
memory not allocated to it and {core dump}s with a segment violation error.
2. To lose a train of thought or a line of reasoning. Also uttered as an
exclamation at the point of befuddlement. segv: /seg'vee/ n.,vi. Yet another
synonym for {segmentation fault}. self-reference: n. see {self-reference}.
selvage: /sel'v@j/ [from sewing] n. see {chad} (sense #1). semi: /se'mee/ or
/se'mie/ 1. n. Abbreviation for `semicolon', when speaking. "Commands to
{grind} are prefixed by semi-semi-star" means that the prefix is `;;*', not
1/4 of a star. 2. Prefix with words such as `immediately', as a qualifier.
"When is the system coming up?" "Semi-immediately." (That is, maybe not for
an hour). "We did consider that possibility semi-seriously." see also
{infinite}. senior bit: [IBM] n. Syn. {meta bit}. server: n. A kind of
{daemon} which performs a service for the requester, which often runs on a
computer other than the one on which the server runs. A particularly common
term on the Internet, which is rife with `name servers', `domain servers',
`news servers', `finger servers', and the like.
