 :SCSI: /n./ [Small Computer System Interface] A bus-independent standard for
system-level interfacing between a computer and intelligent devices.
Typically annotated in literature with `sexy' (/sek'see/), `sissy'
(/sis'ee/), and `scuzzy' (/skuh'zee/) as pronunciation guides -- the last
being the overwhelmingly predominant form, much to the dismay of the
designers and their marketing people. One can usually assume that a person
who pronounces it /S-C-S-I/ is clueless.
