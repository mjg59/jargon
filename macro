 MACRO (mak'ro) n. A name (possibly followed by a formal ARG list) which is
equated to a text expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with
substitution of actual arguments) by a language translator. This definition
can be found in any technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how
the hackish connotations of the term have changed over time. The term `macro'
originated in early assemblers, which encouraged use of macros as a
structuring and information-hiding device. During the early 70s macro
assemblers became ubiquitous and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as
HLLs, only to fall from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized
assembler programming (see LANGUAGES OF CHOICE). Nowadays the term is most
often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several
special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion facility (such as
TEX or UNIX's nroff, troff and pic suite). Indeed, the meaning has drifted
enough that the collective `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any
special-purpose application-control control language, whether or not the
language is actually translated by text expansion.
