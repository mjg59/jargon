 :troglodyte: n. [Commodore] 1. A hacker who never leaves his cubicle. The
term `gnoll' (from Dungeons & Dragons) is also reported. 2. A curmudgeon
attached to an obsolescent computing environment. The combination `ITS
troglodyte' was flung around some during the Usenet and email wringle-wrangle
attending the 2.x.x revision of the Jargon File; at least one of the people
it was intended to describe adopted it with pride.
