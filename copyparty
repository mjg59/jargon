 :copyparty: n. [C64/amiga {demoscene}] A computer party organized so
demosceners can meet other in real life, and to facilitate software copying
(mostly pirated software). The copyparty has become less common as the
Internet makes communication easier. The demoscene has gradually evolved the
{demoparty} to replace it.
