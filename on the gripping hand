 :on the gripping hand: In the progression that starts "On the one hand..."
and continues "On the other hand..." mainstream English may add "on the third
hand..." even though most people don't have three hands. Among hackers, it is
just as likely to be "on the gripping hand". This metaphor supplied the title
of Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle's 1993 SF novel "The Gripping Hand" which
involved a species of hostile aliens with three arms (the same species, in
fact, referenced in {juggling eggs}). As with {TANSTAAFL} and {con}, this
usage became one of the naturalized imports from SF fandom frequently
observed among hackers.
