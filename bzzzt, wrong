 :bzzzt, wrong: /bzt rong/ [USENET/Internet] From a Robin Williams routine in
the movie "Dead Poets Society" spoofing radio or TV quiz programs, such as
*Truth or Consequences*, where an incorrect answer earns one a blast from the
buzzer and condolences from the interlocutor. A way of expressing mock-rude
disagreement, usually immediately following an included quote from another
poster. The less abbreviated "*Bzzzzt*, wrong, but thank you for playing" is
also common; capitalization and emphasis of the buzzer sound varies. = C =
