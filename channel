 :channel: [IRC] n. The basic unit of discussion on {IRC}. Once one joins a
channel, everything one types is read by others on that channel. Channels can
either be named with numbers or with strings that begin with a `#' sign and
can have topic descriptions (which are generally irrelevant to the actual
subject of discussion). Some notable channels are `#initgame', `#hottub', and
`#report'. At times of international crisis, `#report' has hundreds of
members, some of whom take turns listening to various news services and
typing in summaries of the news, or in some cases, giving first-hand accounts
of the action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in Tel Aviv during the Gulf War in
1991).
