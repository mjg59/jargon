 MOUNT (mownt) v. 1. To attach a removable storage volume to a machine. In
elder days and on mainframes this verb was used almost exclusively of tapes;
nowadays (especially under UNIX) it is more likely to refer to a disk volume.
2. By extension, to attach any removable device such as a sensor, robot arm,
or MEATWARE subsystem (see Appendix A).
