 :newgroup wars: /n[y]ooÂ´groop worz/, n. [Usenet] The salvos of dueling
newgroup and rmgroup messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite
sides of a dispute over whether a {newsgroup} should be created net-wide, or
(even more frequently) whether an obsolete one should be removed. These
usually settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the group
has a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't). At times, especially in the
completely anarchic alt hierarchy, the names of newsgroups themselves become
a form of comment or humor; e.g., the group alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork
which originated as a birthday joke for a Muppets fan, or any number of
specialized abuse groups named after particularly notorious {flamer}s, e.g.,
alt.weemba.
