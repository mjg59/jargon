 :newgroup wars: /n[y]oo'groop worz/ [USENET] n. The salvos of dueling
`newgroup' and `rmgroup' messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite
sides of a dispute over whether a {newsgroup} should be created net-wide.
These usually settle out within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the
group has a natural constituency (usually, it doesn't). At times, especially
in the completely anarchic alt hierarchy, the names of newsgroups themselves
become a form of comment or humor; e.g., the spinoff of
alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork from alt.tv.muppets in early 1990, or any
number of specialized abuse groups named after particularly notorious
{flamer}s, e.g., alt.weemba.
