 :network, the: n. 1. The union of all the major noncommercial, academic, and
hacker-oriented networks, such as Internet, the old ARPANET, NSFnet,
{BITNET}, and the virtual UUCP and {USENET} `networks', plus the corporate
in-house networks and commercial time-sharing services (such as CompuServe)
that gateway to them. A site is generally considered `on the network' if it
can be reached through some combination of Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP
(bang-path) addresses. see {bang path}, {{Internet address}}, {network
address}. 2. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian hacker-subversives and
anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert Anton Wilson's novel
`Schr"odinger's Cat', to which many hackers have subsequently decided they
belong (this is an example of {ha ha only serious}). In sense 1, `network' is
often abbreviated to `net'. "Are you on the net?" is a frequent question when
hackers first meet face to face, and "see you on the net!" is a frequent
goodbye.
