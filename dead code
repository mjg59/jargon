 :dead code: n. Routines that can never be accessed because all calls to them
have been removed, or code that cannot be reached because it is guarded by a
control structure that provably must always transfer control somewhere else.
The presence of dead code may reveal either logical errors due to alterations
in the program or significant changes in the assumptions and environment of
the program (see also {software rot}); a good compiler should report dead
code so a maintainer can think about what it means. (Sometimes it simply
means that an *extremely* defensive programmer has inserted {can't happen}
tests which really can't happen -- yet.) Syn. {grunge}. see also {dead}.
