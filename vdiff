 :vdiff: /vee'dif/ v.,n. Visual diff. The operation of finding differences
between two files by {eyeball search}. The term `optical diff' has also been
reported, and is sometimes more specifically used for the act of
superimposing two nearly identical printouts on one another and holding them
up to a light to spot differences. Though this method is poor for detecting
omissions in the `rear' file, it can also be used with printouts of graphics,
a claim few if any diff programs can make. see {diff}. An interesting variant
of the vdiff technique usable by anyone who has sufficient control over the
parallax of their eyeballs (e.g. those who can easily view random-dot
stereograms), is to hold up two paper printouts and go cross-eyed to
superimpose them. This invokes deep, fast, built-in image comparison wetware
(the same machinery responsible for depth perception) and differences stand
out almost immediately. This technique is good for finding edits in graphical
images, or for comparing an image with a compressed version to spot
artifacts.
