 :ENQ: /enkw/, /enk/ [from the ASCII mnemonic ENQuire for 0000101] An on-line
convention for querying someone's availability. After opening a {talk mode}
connection to someone apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type SYN SYN
ENQ? (the SYNs representing notional synchronization bytes), and expect a
return of {ACK} or {NAK} depending on whether or not the person felt
interruptible. Compare {ping}, {finger}, and the usage of FOO? listed under
{talk mode}.
