 ENQ: /enkw/ [from the ASCII mnemonic `ENQuire' for 0000101] 1. An on-line
convention for querying someone's availability. After opening a {talk mode}
connection to someone apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type "SYN SYN
ENQ?" (the SYNs representing notional synchronization bytes) expecting a
return of {ACK} or NAK depending on whether or not the person felt
interruptible. see {ACK}; compare {ping}, {finger}, and the usage of "FOO?"
listed under {talk mode}.
