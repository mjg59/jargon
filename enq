 ENQ: /enkw/ [from the ASCII mnemonic `ENQuire' for #b0000101] ques. An
on-line convention for querying someone's availability. After opening a {talk
mode} connection to someone apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type
"SYN SYN ENQ?" (the SYNs representing notional synchronization bytes)
expecting a return of {ACK} or {NAK} depending on whether or not the person
felt interruptible. Compare {ping}, {finger}, and the usage of "FOO?" listed
under {talk mode}.
