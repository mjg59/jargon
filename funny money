 FUNNY MONEY n. 1. Notional `dollar' units of computing time and/or storage
handed to students at the beginning of a computer course by professors; also
called "purple money" (in implicit opposition to real or "green" money). When
your funny money ran out, your account froze and you needed to go to a
professor to get more. Formerly a common practice, this has now been made
sufficiently rare by the plunging cost of timesharing CYCLES that it has
become folklore. The amounts allocated were almost invariably too small, even
for the non-hackers who wanted to slide by with minimum work. In extreme
cases the practice led to small-scale black markets in bootlegged computer
accounts. 2. By extension, phantom money or quantity tickets of any kind used
as a resource-allocation hack within a system.
