 :funny money: n. 1. Notional `dollar' units of computing time and/or storage
handed to students at the beginning of a computer course; also called `play
money' or `purple money' (in implicit opposition to real or `green' money).
In New Zealand and Germany the odd usage `paper money' has been recorded; in
Germany, the particularly amusing synonym `transfer ruble' commemmorates the
worthlessness of the ex-USSR's currency. When your funny money ran out, your
account froze and you needed to go to a professor to get more. Fortunately,
the plunging cost of timesharing cycles has made this less common. The
amounts allocated were almost invariably too small, even for the non-hackers
who wanted to slide by with minimum work. In extreme cases, the practice led
to small-scale black markets in bootlegged computer accounts. 2. By
extension, phantom money or quantity tickets of any kind used as a
resource-allocation hack within a system. Antonym: `real money'.
