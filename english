 :English: 1. n. obs. The source code for a program, which may be in any
language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary produced from it by
a compiler. The idea behind the term is that to a real hacker, a program
written in his favorite programming language is at least as readable as
English. Usage: mostly by old-time hackers, though recognizable in context.
Today the preferred shorthand is simply {source}. 2. The official name of the
database language used by the old Pick Operating System, actually a sort of
crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of grandeur. The name permitted
{marketroid}s to say "Yes, and you can program our computers in English!" to
ignorant {suit}s without quite running afoul of the truth-in-advertising
laws.
