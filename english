 ENGLISH (ing'lish) n. The source code for a program, which may be in any
language, as opposed to BINARY. Usage: obsolete, used mostly by old-time
hackers, though recognizable in context. On ITS, directory SYSENG was where
the "English" for system programs is kept, and SYSBIN, the binaries. SAIL had
many such directories, but the canonical one is [CSP,SYS].
