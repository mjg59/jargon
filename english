 ENGLISH /ing'lish/ n. The source code for a program, which may be in any
language, as opposed to BINARY. The idea behind the term is that to a real
hacker, a program written in his favorite programming language is as readable
as English. Usage: obsolete, used mostly by old-time hackers, though
recognizable in context. On ITS, directory SYSENG was where the "English" for
system programs is kept, and SYSBIN, the binaries. SAIL had many such
directories, but the canonical one was [CSP,SYS].
