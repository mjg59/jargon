 ENGLISH n. The source code for a program, which may be in any language, as
opposed to BINARY. Usage: slightly obsolete, used mostly by old-time hackers,
though recognizable in context. At MIT, directory SYSENG is where the
"English" for system programs is kept, and SYSBIN, the binaries. SAIL has
many such directories, but the canonical one is [CSP,SYS].
