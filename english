 :English: 1. n.,obs. The source code for a program, which may be in any
language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary produced from it by
a compiler. The idea behind the term is that to a real hacker, a program
written in his favorite programming language is at least as readable as
English. Usage: mostly by old-time hackers, though recognizable in context.
2. The official name of the database language used by the Pick Operating
System, actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions of
grandeur. The name permits {marketroid}s to say "Yes, and you can program our
computers in English!" to ignorant {suit}s without quite running afoul of the
truth-in-advertising laws.
