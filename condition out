 :condition out: /vt./ To prevent a section of code from being compiled by
surrounding it with a conditional-compilation directive whose condition is
always false. The {canonical} examples of these directives are `#if 0' (or
`#ifdef notdef', though some find the latter {bletcherous}) and `#endif' in
C. Compare {comment out}.
