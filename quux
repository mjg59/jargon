 :quux: /kwuhks/ n. [Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb quuxo,
quuxare, quuxandum iri; noun form variously `quux' (plural `quuces',
anglicized to `quuxes') and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four
u-letters out of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble).] 1.
Originally, a {metasyntactic variable} like {foo} and {foobar}. Invented by
Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was young and naive and not yet
interacting with the real computing community. Many people invent such words;
this one seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little. In
an eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the originator in
the form of a nickname. 2. interj. see {foo}; however, denotes very little
disgust, and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. Guy Steele
in his persona as `The Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light
verse and for the `Crunchly' cartoons. 4. In some circles, used as a punning
opposite of `crux'. "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" implies that the
point is *not* crucial (compare {tip of the ice-cube}). 5. quuxy: adj. Of or
pertaining to a quux.
