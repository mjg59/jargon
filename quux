 QUUX [invented by Steele. Mythically, from the Latin semi- deponent verb
QUUXO, QUUXARE, QUUXANDUM IRI; noun form variously QUUX (plural QUUCES,
Anglicized to QUUXES) and QUUXU (genitive plural is QUUXUUM, four U's in
seven letters).] 1. Originally, a meta-word like FOO and FOOBAR. Invented by
Guy Steele for precisely this pur- pose when he was young and naive and not
yet interacting with the real computing community. Many people invent such
words; this one seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a
little. 2. interj. see FOO; however, denotes very little disgust, and is
uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. n. Refers to one of four
people who went to Boston Latin School and eventually to MIT: THE GREAT QUUX:
Guy L. Steele, Jr. THE LESSER QUUX: David J. Littleboy THE MEDIOCRE QUUX:
Alan P. Swide THE MICRO QUUX: Sam Lewis (This taxonomy is said to be
similarly applied to three Frankston brothers at MIT.) QUUX, without
qualifica- tion, usually refers to The Great Quux, who is somewhat infamous
for light verse and for the "Crunchly" car- toons. 4. QUUXY: adj. Of or
pertaining to a QUUX.
