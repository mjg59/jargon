 QUUX (kwooks) [invented by Steele] Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent
verb QUUXO, QUUXARE, QUUXANDUM IRI; noun form variously QUUX (plural QUUCES,
Anglicized to QUUXES) and QUUXU (genitive plural is QUUXUUM, four U's in
seven letters).] 1. Originally, a meta-word like FOO and FOOBAR. Invented by
Guy Steele for precisely this purpose when he was young and naive and not yet
interacting with the real computing community. Many people invent such words;
this one seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little. 2.
interj. see FOO; however, denotes very little disgust, and is uttered mostly
for the sake of the sound of it. 3. n. Refers to one of three people who went
to Boston Latin School and eventually to MIT: THE GREAT QUUX: Guy L. Steele
Jr. THE LESSER QUUX: David J. Littleboy THE MEDIOCRE QUUX: Alan P. Swide
(This taxonomy is said to be similarly applied to three Frankston brothers at
MIT.) QUUX, without qualification, usually refers to The Great Quux, who is
somewhat infamous for light verse and for the "Crunchly" cartoons. 4. QUUXY:
adj. Of or pertaining to a QUUX. 5. n. The Micro Quux (Sam Lewis). = R =
