 :breath-of-life packet: [XEROX PARC] n. An Ethernet packet that contains
bootstrap (see {boot}) code, periodically sent out from a working computer to
infuse the `breath of life' into any computer on the network that has
happened to crash. Machines depending on such packets have sufficient
hardware or firmware code to wait for (or request) such a packet during the
reboot process. see also {dickless workstation}. The `kiss-of-death packet',
with a function complementary to that of a breath-of-life packet, is
recommended for dealing with hosts that consume too many network resources.
This packet, however, is undocumented and perhaps mythical.
