 :breath-of-life packet: [XEROX PARC] n. An Ethernet packet that contained
bootstrap (see {boot}) code, periodically sent out from a working computer to
infuse the `breath of life' into any computer on the network that had
happened to crash. Machines depending on such packets have sufficient
hardware or firmware code to wait for (or request) such a packet during the
reboot process. see also {dickless workstation}.
