 :wabbit: /wab'it/ n. [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line "You
wascawwy wabbit!"] 1. A legendary early hack reported on a System/360 at RPI
and elsewhere around 1978; this may have descended (if only by inspiration)
from a hack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the
University of Washington Computer Center. The program would make two copies
of itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system. 2. By
extension, any hack that includes infinite self-replication but is not a
{virus} or {worm}. see {fork bomb} and {rabbit job}, see also {cookie
monster}.
