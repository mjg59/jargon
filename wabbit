 WABBIT (wabb'it) [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line "you
wascal wabbit!"] n. 1. A legendary early hack reported on the PDP-10s at RPI
and elsewhere around 1978. The program would reproduce itself twice every
time it was run, eventually crashing the system. 2. By extension, any hack
that includes infinite self-replication but is not a VIRUS or WORM. see also
