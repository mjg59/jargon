 :wabbit: /wab'it/ [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line "You
wascawwy wabbit!"] n. 1. A legendary early hack reported on a System/360 at
RPI and elsewhere around 1978; this may have descended (if only by
inspiration) from hack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 55000
at the University of Washington Computer Center. The program would make two
copies of itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system. 2. By
extension, any hack that includes infinite self-replication but is not a
{virus} or {worm}. see {fork bomb} and {rabbit job}, see also {cookie
monster}.
