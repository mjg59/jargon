 :chainik: /chi:Â´nik/ [Russian, literally "teapot"] Almost synonymous with
{muggle}. Implies both ignorance and a certain amount of willingness to
learn, but does not necessarily imply as little experience or short exposure
time as {newbie} and is not as derogatory as {luser}. Both a novice user and
someone using a system for a long time without any understanding of the
internals can be referred to as chainiks. Very widespread term in Russian
hackish, often used in an English context by Russian-speaking hackers esp. in
Israel (e.g. "Our new colleague is a complete chainik"). FidoNet discussion
groups often had a "chainik" subsection for newbies and, well, old chainiks
(eg. su.asm.chainik, ru.linux.chainik, ru.html.chainik). Public projects
often have a chainik mailing list to keep the chainiks off the developers'
and experienced users' discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into
mainstream Russian due to the Russian translation of the popular yellow-black
covered "foobar for dummies" series, which (correctly) uses "chainik" for
"dummy", but its frequent (though not excessive) use is still characteristic
hacker-speak.
