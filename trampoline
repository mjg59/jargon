 :trampoline: n. An incredibly {hairy} technique, found in some {HLL} and
program-overlay implementations (e.g., on the Macintosh), that involves
on-the-fly generation of small executable (and, likely as not,
self-modifying) code objects to do indirection between code sections. These
pieces of {live data} are called `trampolines'. Trampolines are notoriously
difficult to understand in action; in fact, it is said by those who use this
term that the trampoline that doesn't bend your brain is not the true
trampoline. see also {snap}.
