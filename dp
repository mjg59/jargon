 DPer: n. Data Processor. Hackers are absolutely amazed that {suit}s use this
term self-referentially. "*Computers* process data, not people!" see {DP}.
dragon: n. [MIT] A program similar to a {daemon}, except that it is not
invoked at all, but is instead used by the system to perform various
secondary tasks. A typical example would be an accounting program, which
keeps track of who is logged in, accumulates load-average statistics, etc.
Under ITS, many terminals displayed a list of people logged in, where they
were, what they were running, etc. along with some random picture (such as a
unicorn, Snoopy, or the Enterprise) which was generated by the `name dragon'.
Usage: rare outside MIT --- under UNIX and most other OSes this would be
called a `background demon' or {daemon}. The best-known UNIX example of a
dragon is `cron(1)'. At SAIL, they called this sort of thing a `phantom'.
Dragon Book: n. Aho, Sethi, and Ullman's classic text `Compilers: Principles,
Techniques and Tools', so called because of the cover design depicting a
knight slaying a dragon labelled `compiler complexity'. This actually
describes the `Red Dragon Book' (1986); an earlier edition (sans Sethi and
titled `Principles Of Compiler Design') was the `Green Dragon Book' (1977).
There is now a third edition of the Dragon Book that has the knight sitting
in front of what, for all the world, looks like a video-game display of the
dragon, with the real dragon behind it. The term `White Dragon Book' has been
proposed. see also {{book titles}}. drain: [IBM] v. Syn. for {flush} (sense
#2). Has a connotation of finality about it; one speaks of draining a device
before taking it offline. dread high-bit disease: n. A condition endemic to
PRIME (a.k.a PR1ME) minicomputers which results in all the characters having
their high (0x80) bit ON rather than OFF. This of course makes transporting
files to other systems much more difficult, not to mention talking to true
eight-bit devices. It is reported that PRIME adopted the reversed-eight-bit
convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine. This
probably qualifies as one of the most {cretinous} design tradeoffs ever made.
see {meta bit}.
