 :sig virus: /n./ A parasitic {meme} embedded in a {sig block}. There was a
{meme plague} or fad for these on Usenet in late 1991. Most were equivalents
of "I am a .sig virus. Please reproduce me in your .sig block.". Of course,
the .sig virus's memetic hook is the giggle value of going along with the
gag; this, however, was a self-limiting phenomenon as more and more people
picked up on the idea. There were creative variants on it; some people stuck
`sig virus antibody' texts in their sigs, and there was at least one instance
of a sig virus eater.
