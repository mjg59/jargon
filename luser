 :luser: /looÂ´zr/, n. [common] A {user}; esp. one who is also a {loser}.
({luser} and {loser} are pronounced identically.) This word was coined around
1975 at MIT. Under ITS, when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and
typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status
information, including how many people were already using the computer; it
might print "14 users", for example. Someone thought it would be a great joke
to patch the system to print "14 losers" instead. There ensued a great
controversy, as some of the users didn't particularly want to be called
losers to their faces every time they used the computer. For a while several
hackers struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the
others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it
would say "users" or "losers". Finally, someone tried the compromise
"lusers", and it stuck. Later one of the ITS machines supported luser as a
request-for-help command. ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a museum
piece; the usage lives on, however, and the term luser is often seen in
program comments and on Usenet. Compare {mundane}, {muggle}, {newbie},
{chainik}. M M M$ macdink machoflops Macintoy Macintrash macro macro-
