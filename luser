 LUSER /loo'zr/ n. A USER who is probably also a LOSER. (LUSER and LOSER are
pronounced identically.) This word was coined about 1975 at MIT. Under ITS,
when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the
computer's attention, it prints out some status information, including how
many people are already using the computer; it might print "14 users", for
example. Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to
print "14 losers" instead. There ensued a great controversy, as some of the
users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces every time
they used the computer. For a while several hackers struggled covertly, each
changing the message behind the back of the others; any time you logged into
the computer it was even money whether it would say "users" or "losers".
Finally, someone tried the compromise "lusers", and it stuck until ITS died
in early 1990. The usage lives on, however, and the term `luser' is often
seen in program comments. {= M =}
