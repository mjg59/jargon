 :Plan 9: n. In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike
of Kernighan & Pike fame) got bored with the limitations of UNIX and decided
to reimplement the entire system. The result was called Plan 9 in "the Bell
Labs tradition of selecting names that make marketeers wince." The developers
also wished to pay homage to the famous film, "Plan 9 From Outer Space",
considered by some to be the worst movie ever made. The source is available
for download under almost-open-source terms. The developers and a small fan
base hang out at comp.os.plan9, where one can occasionally hear "If you want
UNIX, you know where to find it"
