 CANONICAL adj. The usual or standard state or manner of something. This word
has a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics. For example, one
sometimes speaks of a formula as being in canonical form. Two formulas such
as "9 + x" and "x + 9" are said to be equivalent because they mean the same
thing, but the second one is in canonical form because it is written in the
usual way, with the highest power of x first. Usually there are fixed rules
you can use to decide whether something is in canonical form. The slang
meaning is a relaxation of the technical meaning (this generalization is
actually not confined to hackers, and may be found throughout academia). A
true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance
at the use of jargon. Over his loud objections, we made a point of using
jargon as much as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink
in. Finally, in one conversation, he used the word "canonical" in jargon-like
fashion without thinking. Steele: "Aha! We've finally got you talking jargon
too!" Stallman: "What did he say?" Steele: "Bob just used `canonical' in the
canonical way."
