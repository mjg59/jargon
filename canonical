 CANONICAL adj. The usual or standard state or manner of something. This
usage is actually not confined to hackers, and may be found throughout
academia. A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed
some annoyance at the use of jargon. Over his loud objections, we made a
point of using jargon as much as possible in his presence, and eventually it
began to sink in. Finally, in one conversation, he used the word "canonical"
in jargon-like fashion without thinking. Steele: "Aha! We've finally got you
talking jargon too!" Stallman: "What did he say?" Steele: "He just used
`canonical' in the canonical way."
