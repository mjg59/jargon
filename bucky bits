 BUCKY BITS /buh'kee bits/ [primarily Stanford] n. The bits produced by the
CTRL and META shift keys, esp. on a Stanford (or Knight) keyboard (see
SPACE-CADET KEYBOARD). It is rumored that these were in fact named for
Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at Stanford.
Unfortunately, legend also has it that "Bucky" was Niklaus Wirth's nickname
when *he* was consulting at Stanford and that he first suggested the idea of
the meta key, so its bit was named after him. see DOUBLE BUCKY, QUADRUPLE
BUCKY.
