 :bucky bits: /buh'kee bits/ n. 1. obs. The bits produced by the CONTROL and
META shift keys on a SAIL keyboard (octal 200 and 400 respectively),
resulting in a 9-bit keyboard character set. The MIT AI TV (Knight) keyboards
extended this with TOP and separate left and right CONTROL and META keys,
resulting in a 12-bit character set; later, LISP Machines added such keys as
SUPER, HYPER, and GREEK (see {space-cadet keyboard}). 2. By extension, bits
associated with `extra' shift keys on any keyboard, e.g., the ALT on an IBM
PC or command and option keys on a Macintosh. It is rumored that `bucky bits'
were named for Buckminster Fuller during a period when he was consulting at
Stanford. Actually, `Bucky' was Niklaus Wirth's nickname when *he* was at
Stanford; he first suggested the idea of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an
otherwise 7-bit ASCII character. This was used in a number of editors written
at Stanford or in its environs (TV-EDIT and NLS being the best-known). The
term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use. see {double
bucky}, {quadruple bucky}.
