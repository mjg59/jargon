 BUCKY BITS (primarily Stanford) n. The bits produced by the CTRL and META
shift keys on a Stanford (or Knight) keyboard. Rumor has it that the idea for
extra bits for characters came from Niklaus Wirth, and that his nickname was
`Bucky'. DOUBLE BUCKY: adj. Using both the CTRL and META keys. "The command
to burn all LEDs is double bucky F."
