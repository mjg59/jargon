 BUCKY BITS (buh'kee bits) [primarily Stanford] n. The bits produced by the
CTRL and META shift keys on a Stanford (or Knight) keyboard. It is rumored
that these were in fact named for Buckminster Fuller during a period when he
was consulting at Stanford. Unfortunately, legend also has it that "Bucky"
was Niklaus Wirth's nickname when *he* was consulting at Stanford and that he
first suggested the idea of the meta key, so its bit was named after him.
DOUBLE BUCKY: adj. Using both the CTRL and META keys. "The command to burn
all LEDs is double bucky F." see also META BIT, COKEBOTTLE.
