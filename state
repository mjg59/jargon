 :state: /n./ 1. Condition, situation. "What's the state of your latest
hack?" "It's winning away." "The system tried to read and write the disk
simultaneously and got into a totally {wedged} state." The standard question
"What's your state?" means "What are you doing?" or "What are you about to
do?" Typical answers are "about to gronk out", or "hungry". Another standard
question is "What's the state of the world?", meaning "What's new?" or
"What's going on?". The more terse and humorous way of asking these questions
would be "State-p?". Another way of phrasing the first question under sense 1
would be "state-p latest hack?". 2. Information being maintained in
