 STATE n. Condition, situation. "What's the state of your latest hack?" "It's
winning away." "The system tried to read and write the disk simultaneously
and got into a totally wedged state." A standard question is "What's your
state?" which means "What are you doing?" or "What are you about to do?"
Typical answers might be "I'm about to GRONK OUT", or "I'm hungry". Another
standard question is "What's the state of the world?" meaning "What's new?"
or "What's going on?". The more terse and humorous way of asking these
conventions would be "State-p?".
