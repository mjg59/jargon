 :livelock: /li:vÂ´lok/, n. A situation in which some critical stage of a task
is unable to finish because its clients perpetually create more work for it
to do after they have been serviced but before it can clear its queue.
Differs from {deadlock} in that the process is not blocked or waiting for
anything, but has a virtually infinite amount of work to do and can never
catch up.
