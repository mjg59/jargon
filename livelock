 LIVELOCK (liev'lok) n. A situation in which some critical stage of a task is
unable to finish because its clients perpetually create more work for it to
do after they've been serviced but before it can clear. Differs from DEADLOCK
in that the process is not blocked or waiting for anything, but has a
virtually infinite amount of work to do and accomplishes nothing.
