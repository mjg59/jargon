 :smoke: /vi./ 1. To {crash} or blow up, usually spectacularly. "The new
version smoked, just like the last one." Used for both hardware (where it
often describes an actual physical event), and software (where it's merely
colorful). 2. [from automotive slang] To be conspicuously fast. "That
processor really smokes." Compare {magic smoke}.
