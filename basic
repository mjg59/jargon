 :BASIC: /bay'Â·sic/, n. A programming language, originally designed for
Dartmouth's experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for
many years was the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W.
Dijkstra observed in Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective
that "It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to
students that have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they
are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." This is another case
(like {Pascal}) of the cascading {lossage} that happens when a language
deliberately designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A
novice can write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very
easily; writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad
habits that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well. This
wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on
low-end micros in the 1980s. As it is, it probably ruined tens of thousands
of potential wizards. [1995: Some languages called "BASIC" aren't quite this
nasty any more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control
structures and shed their line numbers. --ESR] BASIC stands for "Beginner's
All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code". Earlier versions of this entry
claiming this was a later {backronym} were incorrect.
