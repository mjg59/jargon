 10 and VAX product lines were competing with each other and decided to
concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable VAX. The
machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of
the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model. (Some attempts by
other companies to market clones came to nothing; see {Foonly} and {Mars}.)
This event spelled the doom of {{ITS}} and the technical cultures that had
spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of
a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth on a
PDP-10. see {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}}, {BLT}, {DDT}, {DPB}, {EXCH}, {HAKMEM},
{LDB}, {pop}, {push}. see also `http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/'. :PDP-20: n. The
most famous computer that never was. {PDP-10} computers running the
{{TOPS-10}} operating system were labeled `DECsystem-10' as a way of
differentiating them from the PDP-11. Later on, those systems running
{TOPS-20} were labeled `DECSYSTEM-20' (the block capitals being the result of
a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called
`system-10'), but contrary to popular lore there was never a `PDP-20'; the
only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the operating system and the color
of the paint. Most (but not all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted
`Basil Blue', whereas most TOPS-20 machines were painted `Chinese Red' (often
mistakenly called orange). :PEBKAC: /peb'kak/ [Abbrev., "Problem Exists
Between Keyboard And Chair"] Used by support people, particularly at call
centers and help desks. Not used with the public. Denotes pilot error as the
cause of the crash, especially stupid errors that even a {luser} could figure
out. Very derogatory. Usage: "Did you ever figure out why that guy couldn't
print?" "Yeah, he kept cancelling the operation before it could finish.
PEBKAC." :peek: n.,vt. (and {poke}) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs
for directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often extended
to mean the corresponding constructs in any {HLL} (peek reads memory, poke
modifies it). Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of
`peek'ing around memory, more or less at random, to find the location where
the system keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably accurate) lists of
such addresses for various computers circulated (see {{interrupt list}}). The
results of `poke's at these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing,
useless but neat, or (most likely) total {lossage} (see {killer poke}). Since
a {real operating system} provides useful, higher-level services for the
tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on micros, and real languages
tend not to encourage low-level memory groveling, a question like "How do I
do a peek in C?" is diagnostic of the {newbie}. (Of course, OS kernels often
have to do exactly this; a real kernel hacker would unhesitatingly, if
unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer variable and indirect
through it.) :pencil and paper: n. An archaic information storage and
transmission device that works by depositing smears of graphite on bleached
wood pulp. More recent developments in paper-based technology include
improved `write-once' update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to
mouse balls to deposit colored pigment. All these devices require an operator
skilled at so-called `handwriting' technique. These technologies are
ubiquitous outside hackerdom, but nearly forgotten inside it. Most hackers
had terrible handwriting to begin with, and years of keyboarding tend to have
encouraged it to degrade further. Perhaps for this reason, hackers deprecate
pencil-and-paper technology and often resist using it in any but the most
trivial contexts. :Pentagram Pro: n. A humorous corruption of "Pentium Pro",
with a Satanic reference, implying that the chip is inherently {evil}. Often
used with "666 MHz"; there is a T-shirt. see {Pentium} :Pentium: n. The name
given to Intel's P5 chip, the successor to the 80486. The name was chosen
because of difficulties Intel had in trademarking a number. It suggests the
number five (implying 586) while (according to Intel) conveying a meaning of
strength "like titanium". Among hackers, the plural is frequently `pentia'.
see also {Pentagram Pro}. Intel did not stick to this convention when naming
its P6 processor the Pentium Pro; many believe this is due to difficulties in
selling a chip with "sex" in its name. Successor chips have been called
`Pentium II' and `Pentium III'. :peon: n. A person with no special ({root} or
{wheel}) privileges on a computer system. "I can't create an account on
_foovax_ for you; I'm only a peon there." :percent-S: /per-sent' es'/ n.
[From the code in C's `printf(3)' library function used to insert an
arbitrary string argument] An unspecified person or object. "I was just
talking to some percent-s in administration." Compare {random}. :perf: /perf/
n. Syn. {chad} (sense 1). The term `perfory' /per'f*-ree/ is also heard. The
term {perf} may also refer to the perforations themselves, rather than the
chad they produce when torn (philatelists use it this way). :perfect
programmer syndrome: n. Arrogance; the egotistical conviction that one is
above normal human error. Most frequently found among programmers of some
native ability but relatively little experience (especially new graduates;
their perceptions may be distorted by a history of excellent performance at
solving {toy problem}s). "Of course my program is correct, there is no need
to test it." "Yes,
