 :BASIC: /bay'-sic/ /n./ [acronym: Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code] A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's
experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which has since become
the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W. Dijkstra
observed in "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that "It
is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that
have had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally
mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." This is another case (like {Pascal})
of the cascading lossage that happens when a language deliberately designed
as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short
BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything
longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it
harder to use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if
historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros. As it is,
it ruins thousands of potential wizards a year. [1995: Some languages called
`BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any more, having acquired Pascal- and C-like
procedures and control structures and shed their line numbers. --ESR]
