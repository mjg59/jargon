 RETROCOMPUTING /ret'-roh-k@m-pyoo'ting/ n. Refers to emulations of
way-behind-the state-of-the-art hardware or software, or implementations of
never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such implementations are elaborate
practical jokes and/or parodies of more `serious' designs. Perhaps the most
widely distributed retrocomputing utility was the pnch(6) program on V7 and
other early UNIX versions, which would accept up to 80 characters of text
argument and display the corresponding pattern in Hollerith card code. Other
well-known retrocomputing hacks have included the programming language
INTERCAL (q.v.), a jcl-emulating shell for UNIX, the card-punch-emulating
editor named 029, and various elaborate PDP-11 hardware emulators and RT-11
OS emulators written just to keep an old, sourceless ZORK binary running.
