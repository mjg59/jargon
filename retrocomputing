 :retrocomputing: /ret'-roh-k*m-pyoo'ting/ /n./ Refers to emulations of
way-behind-the-state-of-the-art hardware or software, or implementations of
never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such implementations are elaborate
practical jokes and/or parodies, written mostly for {hack value}, of more
`serious' designs. Perhaps the most widely distributed retrocomputing utility
was the `pnch(6)' or `bcd(6)' program on V7 and other early Unix versions,
which would accept up to 80 characters of text argument and display the
corresponding pattern in {{punched card}} code. Other well-known
retrocomputing hacks have included the programming language {INTERCAL}, a
{JCL}-emulating shell for Unix, the card-punch-emulating editor named 029,
and various elaborate PDP-11 hardware emulators and RT-11 OS emulators
written just to keep an old, sourceless {Zork} binary running.
