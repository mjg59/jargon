 RETROCOMPUTING (ret'-roh-k@m-pyoo'ting) n. Refers to emulations of
way-behind-the state-of-the-art hardware or software, or implementations of
never-was-state-of-the-art; esp. if such implementations are elaborate
practical jokes and/or parodies of more `serious' designs. Perhaps the most
widely distributed retrocomputing utility was the pnch(6) program on V7 and
other early UNIX versions, which would accept up to 80 characters of text
argument and display the corresponding pattern in Hollerith card code. Other
well-known retrocomputing hacks have included the language INTERCAL, a
jcl-emulating shell for UNIX, and the card-punch-emulating editor named 029.
