 YAUN: /yawn/ [Acronym for `Yet Another UNIX Nerd'] n. Reported from the San
Diego Computer Society (predominantly a microcomputer users' group) as a
good-natured punning insult aimed at UNIX zealots. Yellow Book: n. The print
version of this Jargon File; `The New Hacker's Dictionary', forthcoming from
MIT Press, 1991. Includes all the material in the File, plus a Foreword by
Guy L. Steele and a Preface by Eric S. Raymond. Most importantly, the book
version is nicely typeset and includes almost all of the infamous Crunchly
cartoons by the Great Quux, each attached to an appropriate entry. Yet
Another: adj. [From UNIX's `yacc(1)', `Yet Another Compiler- Compiler', a
LALR parser generator] 1. Of your own work: humorous allusion often used in
titles to acknowledge that the topic is not original, though the content is.
As in `Yet Another AI Group' or `Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm'.
2. Of other's work: describes something of which there are far too many. see
also {YA-}, {YABA}, {YAUN}. You are not expected to understand this: cav.
[UNIX] Canonical comment describing something {magic} or too complicated to
bother explaining properly. From a comment in either the context switching
code of the V6 UNIX kernel or the V6 tty driver (accounts differ). You know
you've been hacking too long when...: The set-up line for a genre of
one-liners told by hackers about themselves. These include the following: *
not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but you
remember your {network address} faster than your postal one. * your {SO}
kisses you on the neck and the first thing you think is "Uh, oh, {priority
interrupt}.". * you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're
doing it in octal. * your computers have a higher street value than your car.
* `round numbers' are powers of 2, not 10. * you've woken up more than once
to recall of a dream in some programming language. * you realize you've never
seen half of your best friends. All but one of these have been reliably
reported as hacker traits (some of them quite often). Even hackers may have
trouble spotting the ringer. Your mileage may vary: cav. [from the standard
disclaimer attached to EPA mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] 1.
A ritual warning often found in UNIX freeware distributions. Translates
roughly as "Hey, I tried to write this portably but who *knows* what'll
happen on your system?" 2. A qualifier more generally attached to advice. "I
find that sending flowers works well, but your mileage may vary." Yow!: /yow/
[from Zippy the Pinhead comix] interj. Favored hacker expression of humorous
surprise or emphasis. "Yow! Check out what happens when you twiddle the foo
option on this display hack!" Compare {gurfle}. yoyo mode: n. State in which
the system is said to be when it rapidly alternates several times between
being up and being down. Interestingly (and perhaps not by coincidence), many
hardware vendors give out free yoyos at Usenix exhibits. Sun Microsystems
gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88. Tourists staying at one of Atlanta's
most respectable hotels were subsequently treated to the sight of 200 of the
country's top computer scientists testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.
Yu-Shiang Whole Fish: /yoo-shyang hohl fish/ n. obs. The character gamma
(extended SAIL ASCII #b1001011), which with a loop in its tail looks like a
little fish swimming down the page. The term is actually the name of a
Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not {parse}d) and covered with
Yu Shiang sauce. Usage: was used primarily by people on the MIT LISP Machine,
which could display this character on the screen. Tends to elicit incredulity
from people who hear about it second-hand. = Z = ===== zap: 1. n. Spiciness.
2. vt. To make food spicy. 3. vt. To make someone `suffer' by making his food
spicy. (Most hackers love spicy food. Hot-and-sour soup is considered wimpy
unless it makes you wipe your nose for the rest of the meal.) see {zapped}.
4. vt. To modify, usually to correct; esp. used when the action is performed
with a debugger or binary patching tool. Also implies surgical precision. In
the IBM mainframe world, binary patches are applied to programs or to the OS
with a program called `superzap', whose file name is `IMASPZAP' (I M A
SuPerZAP). 5. vt. To erase or reset. 6. To {fry} a chip with static
electricity. zapped: adj. Spicy. This term is used to distinguish between
food that is hot (in temperature) and food that is *spicy*-hot. For example,
the Chinese appetizer Bon Bon Chicken is a kind of chicken salad that is cold
but zapped; by contrast, {vanilla} wonton soup is hot but not zapped. see
also {{Oriental Food}}, {laser chicken}. see {zap}, senses #1 and #2. zen:
vt. To figure out something by meditation, or by a sudden flash of
enlightenment. Originally applied to bugs, but occasionally applied to
problems of life in general. "How'd you figure out the buffer allocation
problem?" "Oh, I zenned it". Contrast {grok}, which connotes a time-extended
version of zenning a system. Compare {hack mode}. see also {guru}. zero: vt.
1. To set to zero. Usually said of small pieces of data, such as bits or
words. 2. To erase; to discard all data from. Said of disks and directories,
where `zeroing' need not involve actually writing zeroes throughout the area
being zeroed. One may speak of something being `logically zeroed' rather than
being `physically zeroed'. see {scribble}. zero-content: adj. Syn.
{content-free}. zeroth: /zee'rohth/ adj. First. Among software designers,
comes from C's and LISP's 0-based indexing of arrays. Hardware people also
tend to start counting at zero instead of one; this is natural since, e.g.,
the 256 states of 8 bits correspond to the binary numbers 0,1,...,255 and the
digital devices known as `counters' count in this way. Hackers and computer
scientists often like to call the first chapter of a publication `Chapter 0',
especially if it is of an introductory nature (one of the classic instances
was in the First Edition of {K&R}). In recent years this trait has also been
observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an independent tradition of
numbering from 0). Zero-based numbering tends to reduce {fencepost error}s,
though it cannot eliminate them entirely. zigamorph: /zig'*-morf/ n. Hex FF
(binary #b11111111) when used as a delimiter or {fence} character. Usage:
primarily IBM shops. zip: [primarily MSDOS] vt. To create a compressed
archive from a group of files using PKWare's PKZIP or a compatible archiver.
Its use is spreading now that portable implementations of the algorithm have
been written. Commonly used as "I'll zip it up and send it to you." see
{arc}, {tar and feather}. zipperhead: [IBM] n. A person with a closed mind.
zombie: [UNIX] n. A process that has died but has not yet relinquished its
process table slot (because the parent process hasn't executed a `wait(2)'
for it yet). These can be seen in `ps(1)' listings occasionally. Compare
{orphan}. zorch: [TMRC] v. 1. To attack with an inverse heat sink. 2. To
travel, v approaching c [that is, with velocity approaching lightspeed ---
ESR]. Zork: /zork/ n. Second of the great early experiments in computer
fantasy gaming; see {ADVENT}. Originally written on MIT-DM during the late
seventies, later distributed with BSD UNIX and commercialized as `The Zork
Trilogy' by Infocom. zorkmid: n. The canonical unit of currency in
hacker-written games. This originated in zork: but has spread to {nethack}
and is referred to in several other games. Appendix A: Hacker Folklore
*************************** This appendix contains several legends and fables
which illuminate the meaning of various entries in the lexicon. The Meaning
of `Hack' ===================== "The word {hack} doesn't really have 69
different meanings", according to Phil Agre, an MIT hacker. "In fact, {hack}
has only one meaning, an extremely subtle and profound one which defies
articulation. Which connotation is implied by a given use of the word depends
in similarly profound ways on the context. Similar remarks apply to a couple
of other hacker words, most notably {random}." Hacking might be characterized
as "an appropriate application of ingenuity". Whether the result is a
quick-and-dirty patchwork job or a carefully crafted work of art, you have to
admire the cleverness that went into it. An important secondary meaning of
{hack} is `a creative practical joke'. This kind of hack is easier to explain
to non-hackers than the programming kind. Accordingly, here are some examples
of practical joke hacks: In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game. One student
posed as a reporter and `interviewed' the director of the University of
Washington card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who hold up
colored cards to make pictures). The reporter learned exactly how the stunts
were operated, and also that the director would be out to dinner later. While
the director was eating, the students (who called themselves the `Fiendish
Fourteen') picked a lock and stole one of the direction sheet blanks for the
card stunts. They then had a printer run off
