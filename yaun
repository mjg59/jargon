 YAUN: /yawn/ [Acronym for `Yet Another UNIX Nerd'] n. Reported from the San
Diego Computer Society (predominantly a microcomputer users' group) as a
good-natured punning insult aimed at UNIX zealots. Yellow Book: n. The print
version of this Jargon File; `The New Hacker's Dictionary', forthcoming from
MIT Press, 1991. Includes all the material in the File, plus a Foreword by
Guy Steele and a Preface by Eric S. Raymond. Most importantly, the book
version is nicely typeset and includes almost all of the infamous Crunchly
cartoons by the Great Quux, each attached to an appropriate entry. Yet
Another: adj. [From UNIX's `yacc(1)', `Yet Another Compiler- Compiler' LALR
parser generator] 1. Of your own work: humorous allusion often used in titles
to acknowledge that the topic is not original, though the content is. As in
`Yet Another AI Group' or `Yet Another Simulated Annealing Algorithm'. 2. Of
other's work: describes something of which there are far too many. see also
{YA-}, {YABA}, {YAUN}. You are not expected to understand this.: cav. [UNIX]
Canonical comment describing something {magic} or too complicated to bother
explaining properly. From a comment in the either the context-switching code
of the V6 UNIX kernel or the V6 tty driver (accounts differ). You know you've
been hacking too long when...: The set-up line for a genre of one-liners told
by hackers about themselves. These include the following: * not only do you
check your email more often than your paper mail, but you remember your
{network address} faster than your postal one. * your {SO} kisses you on the
neck and the first thing you think is "Uh, oh, {priority interrupt}". * you
go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're doing it in octal. *
your computers have a higher street value than your car. * `round numbers'
are powers of 2, not 10. * you've woken up more than once to recall of a
dream in some programming language. * you realize you've never met half of
your best friends. All but one of these have been reliably reported as hacker
traits (some of them quite often). Even hackers may have trouble spotting the
ringer. Your mileage may vary.: cav. [from the standard disclaimer attached
to EPA mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] A ritual warning often
found in UNIX freeware distributions. Translates roughly as "Hey, I tried to
write this portably but who *knows* what'll happen on your system?" Yow!:
/yow/ [from Zippy the Pinhead comix] interj. Favored hacker expression of
humorous surprise or emphasis. "Yow! Check out what happens when you twiddle
the foo option on this display hack!" Compare {gurfle}. yoyo mode: n. State
in which the system is said to be when it rapidly alternates several times
between being up and being down. Interestingly (and perhaps not by
coincidence), many hardware vendors give out free yoyos at Usenix exhibits.
Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN `88. Tourists staying at
one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were subsequently treated to the
sight of 200 of the country's top computer scientists testing yo-yo
algorithms in the lobby. Yu-Shiang whole fish: /yoo-shyang hohl fish/ n. obs.
The character gamma (extended SAIL ASCII 1001011), which with a loop in its
tail looks like a little fish swimming down the page. The term is actually
the name of a Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not {parse}d) and
covered with Yu Shiang sauce. Usage: was used primarily by people on the MIT
LISP Machine, which could display this character on the screen. Tends to
elicit incredulity from people who hear about it second-hand. Z - zap: 1. n.
Spiciness. 2. vt. To make food spicy. 3. vt. To make someone `suffer' by
making his food spicy. (Most hackers love spicy food. Hot-and-sour soup is
considered wimpy unless it makes you blow your nose for the rest of the
meal.) see {zapped}. 4. vt. To modify, usually to correct. Also implies
surgical precision. In some communities, this used to describe modifying a
program's binary executable. In the IBM mainframe world, binary patches are
applied to programs or to the OS with a program called `superzap', whose file
name is `IMASPZAP' (I Am A SuperZap) 5. vt. To erase or reset. 6. To {fry} a
chip with static electricity. zapped: adj. Spicy. This term is used to
distinguish between food that is hot (in temperature) and food that is
*spicy*-hot. For example, the Chinese appetizer Bon Bon Chicken is a kind of
chicken salad that is cold but zapped; by contrast, {vanilla} wonton soup is
hot but not zapped. see also {{Oriental Food}}, {laser chicken}. see {zap},
senses #1 and #2. zen: vt. To figure out something by meditation, or by a
sudden flash of enlightenment. Originally applied to bugs, but occasionally
applied to problems of life in general. "How'd you figure out the buffer
allocation problem?" "Oh, I zenned it". Contrast {grok}, which connotes a
time-extended version of zenning a system. Compare {hack mode}. zero: vt. 1.
To set to zero. Usually said of small pieces of data, such as bits or words.
2. To erase; to discard all data from. Said of disks and directories, where
`zeroing' need not involve actually writing zeroes throughout the area being
zeroed. One may speak of something being `logically zeroed' rather than being
`physically zeroed'. see {scribble}. zero-content: adj. Syn. {content-free}.
zeroth: /zee'rohth/ adj. First. Among software designers, comes from C's and
LISP's 0-based indexing of arrays. Hardware people also tend to start
counting at zero instead of one; this is natural since e.g. the 256 states of
8 bits correspond to the binary numbers 0,1,...,255 and the digital devices
known as `counters' count in this way. Hackers and computer scientists often
like to call the first chapter of a publication `Chapter 0', especially if it
is of an introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First
Edition of {K&R}). In recent years this trait has also been observed among
many pure mathematicians (who have an independent tradition of numbering from
0). zigamorph: /zie'-g@-morf/ n. Hex FF (binary 11111111) when used as a
delimiter or {fence} character. zip: [primarily MSDOS] vt. To create a
compressed archive from a group of files using PKWare's PKZIP or a compatible
archiver. Its use is spreading now that portable implementations of the
algorithm have been written. Commonly used as "I'll zip it up and send it to
you". see {arc}, {tar and feather}. zipperhead: [IBM] n. A person with a
closed mind. zombie: [UNIX] n. A process that has died but has not yet
relinquished its process table slot (because the parent process hasn't
executed a `wait(2)' for it yet). These show up in `ps(1)' listings
occasionally. Compare {orphan}. zork: /zork/ n. Second of the great early
experiments in computer fantasy gaming; see {ADVENT}. Originally written on
MIT-DMS during the late seventies, later distributed with BSD UNIX and
commercialized as `The Zork Trilogy' by Infocom. Hacker Folklore
*************** This appendix contains several fables and legends which
illuminate the meaning of various entries in the main text. Some of this
material appeared in the 1983 paper edition of the Jargon File (but not in
the previous on-line versions). The Meaning of `Hack' =====================
"The word {hack} doesn't really have 69 different meanings", according to
Phil Agre, an MIT hacker. "In fact, {hack} has only one meaning, an extremely
subtle and profound one which defies articulation. Which connotation is
implied by a given use of the word depends in similarly profound ways on the
context. Similar remarks apply to a couple of other hacker words, most
notably {random}." Hacking might be characterized as "an appropriate
application of ingenuity". Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork
job or a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness
that went into it. An important secondary meaning of {hack} is `a creative
practical joke'. This kind of hack is often easier to explain to non-hackers
than the programming kind. Accordingly, here are some examples of practical
joke hacks: In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game. One student posed
as a reporter and `interviewed' the director of the University of Washington
card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who hold up colored
cards to make pictures). The reporter learned exactly how the stunts were
operated, and also that the director would be out to dinner later. While the
director was eating, the students (who called themselves the `Fiendish
Fourteen') picked a lock and stole one of the direction sheets for the card
stunts. They then had a printer run off 2300 copies of the sheet. The next
day they picked the lock again and stole the master plans for the stunts,
large sheets of graph paper colored in with the stunt pictures. Using these
as a guide, they carefully made `corrections' for three of the stunts on the
duplicate instruction sheets. Finally, they broke in once more, replacing the
stolen master plans and substituting the stack of altered instruction sheets
for the original set. The result was that three of the pictures were totally
different. Instead of spelling "WASHINGTON", the word "CALTECH" was flashed.
Another stunt showed the word "HUSKIES", the Washington nickname, but spelled
it backwards. And what was supposed to have been a picture of a husky instead
showed a beaver. (Both Caltech and MIT use the beaver as a mascot. Beavers
are nature's engineers.) After the game, the Washington faculty athletic
representative said, "Some thought it ingenious; others were indignant." The
Washington student body president remarked, "No hard feelings, but at the
time it was unbelievable. We were amazed." This is now considered a classic
hack, particularly because revising the direction sheets constituted a form
of programming not unlike computer programming. Another classic hack: Some
MIT students once illicitly used a quantity of thermite to weld a trolley car
to its tracks. The hack was actually not dangerous, as they did this at night
to a parked trolley. It took the transit people quite a while to figure out
what was wrong with the trolley, and even longer to figure out how to fix it.
They ended up putting jacks under the trolley and cutting the section of
track on either side of the wheel with oxyacetylene torches. Then they
unbolted the wheel, welded in a new piece of track, bolted on a new wheel,
and removed the jacks. The hackers sneaked in the next night and stole the
piece of track and wheel! The piece of trolley track with the wheel still
welded to it was later used as the trophy at the First Annual All-Tech Sing.
They carted it in on a very heavy duty dolly up the freight elevator of the
Student Center. Six feet of rail and a trolley wheel is a *lot* of steel.
