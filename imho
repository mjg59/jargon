 :IMHO: // /abbrev./ [from SF fandom via Usenet; abbreviation for `In My
Humble Opinion'] "IMHO, mixed-case C names should be avoided, as mistyping
something in the wrong case can cause hard-to-detect errors -- and they look
too Pascalish anyhow." Also seen in variant forms such as IMNSHO (In My
Not-So-Humble Opinion) and IMAO (In My Arrogant Opinion).
