 IMHO: [from SF fandom via USENET] Written acronym for In My Humble Opinion.
Example: "IMHO, mixed-case C names should be avoided, as mistyping something
in the wrong case can cause hard-to-detect errors --- and they look too
Pascalish anyhow." Also seen in variant forms such as IMNSHO (In My
Not-So-Humble Opinion) and IMAO (In My Arrogant Opinion). in the extreme:
adj. A preferred emphasizing suffix for many hackish terms. see, for example,
`obscure in the extreme' under {obscure}, and compare {highly}. incantation:
n. Any particularly arbitrary or obscure command that must be muttered at a
system to attain a desired result. Not used of passwords or other explicit
security features. Especially used of tricks that are so poorly documented
they must be learned from a {wizard}. E.g. "This compiler normally locates
initialized data in the data segment, but if you {mutter} the right
incantation they will be forced into text space". include: vt. [USENET] 1. To
duplicate a portion (or whole) of another's message (typically with
attribution to the source) in a reply or followup, for clarifying the context
of one's response. 2. Derived from C: #include {disclaimer.h} has appeared in
{sig block}s to refer to a notional `standard' disclaimer file. include war:
n. Excessive multi-leveled including within a discussion {thread}, which
tends to annoy readers. In a forum such as USENET, with high-traffic
newsgroups, this can lead to {flame}s and the urge to start a {kill file}.
indent style: [C programmers] n. The rules one uses to lay out code in a
readable fashion; a subject of {holy wars}. There are four major C indent
styles, as described below; all have the aim of making it easier for the
reader to visually track the scope of control constructs. The significant
variable is the placement of { and } with respect to the statement(s) they
enclose and the guard or controlling statement (if, else, for while, or do)
on the block, if any. `K&R style' --- Named after Kernighan & Ritchie,
because the examples in {K&R} are formatted this way. Also called `kernel
style' because the UNIX kernel is written in it, and the `One True Brace
Style', abbr. 1TBS, by its partisans. The basic indent shown here is 8 spaces
(or 1 tab) per level; 4 or 2 is occasionally seen, but is much less common.
if (cond) { <body> } `Allman style' --- Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley
hacker who wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called
`BSD style'). Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol. Basic indent
per level shown here is 8 spaces, but 4 is just as common (esp. in C++ code).
if (cond) { <body> } `Whitesmiths style' --- popularized by the examples that
came with Whitesmiths C, an early commercial C compiler. Basic indent per
level shown here is 8 spaces, but 4 is occasionally seen. if (cond) { <body>
} `GNU style' --- Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation
code, and just about nowhere else. Indents are always 4 spaces per level,
with { and } "centered" between levels. if (cond) { <body> } What style one
uses is very much a matter of personal choice, but one should be consistent
within any one software package. Statistically, surveys have shown the Allman
and Whitesmiths styles to be the most common, with about equal `mind share'.
K&R used to be nearly universal, but is now much less common (the opening
brace tends to get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an if or
while, which is a Bad Thing). infant mortality: n. It is common lore among
hackers that the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off exponentially
with a machine's time since power-up (that is, until the relatively distant
time at which mechanical wear in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in
components has accumulated enough for the machine to start going senile). Up
to half of all chip-and-wire failures happen within a new system's first few
weeks; such failures are often referred to as `infant mortality' problems
(or, occasionally, as `sudden infant death syndrome'). see {bathtub curve}.
infinite: adj. Consisting of a large number of objects; extreme. Used very
loosely as in: "This program produces infinite garbage." "He is an infinite
loser." The word most likely to follow `infinite', though, is {hair}. These
uses are abuses of the word's mathematical meaning. The term "semi-infinite"
denoting an immoderately large amount of some resource is also heard. "This
compiler is taking a semi-infinite amount of time to optimize my program".
see also {semi-}. infinity: n. 1. The largest value that can be represented
in a particular type of variable (register, memory location, data type,
whatever). 2. `minus infinity' The smallest such value. Note that this is
different from `time T equals minus infinity', which is closer to a
mathematician's usage of infinity. insanely great: adj. [Mac community, from
Steve Jobs; also BSD UNIX people via Bill Joy] Something so incredibly
{elegant} that it is imaginable only to someone possessing the greatest of
{hacker}-natures.
