 :dogpile: v. [Usenet: prob. fr. mainstream "puppy pile"] When many people
post unfriendly responses in short order to a single posting, they are
sometimes said to "dogpile" or "dogpile on" the person to whom they're
responding. For example, when a religious missionary posts a simplistic
appeal to alt.atheism, he can expect to be dogpiled. It has been suggested
that this derives from U.S. football slang for a tackle involving three or
more people; among hackers, it seems at least as likely to derive from an
`autobiographical' Bugs Bunny cartoon in which a gang of attacking canines
actually yells "Dogpile on the rabbit!".
