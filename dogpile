 :dogpile: [USENET: prob. fr. mainstream "puppy pile"] v. When many people
post unfriendly responses in short order to a single posting, they are
sometimes said to "dogpile" or "dogpile on" the person to whom they're
responding. For example, when a religious missionary posts a simplistic
appeal to alt.atheism, he can expect to be dogpiled.
