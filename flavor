 :flavor: n. 1. [common] Variety, type, kind. "DDT commands come in two
flavors." "These lights come in two flavors, big red ones and small green
ones." "Linux is a flavor of Unix" see {vanilla}. 2. The attribute that
causes something to be {flavorful}. Usually used in the phrase "yields
additional flavor". "This convention yields additional flavor by allowing one
to print text either right-side-up or upside-down." see {vanilla}. This usage
was certainly reinforced by the terminology of quantum chromodynamics, in
which quarks (the constituents of, e.g., protons) come in six flavors (up,
down, strange, charm, top, bottom) and three colors (red, blue, green) --
however, hackish use of flavor at MIT predated QCD. 3. The term for class (in
the object-oriented sense) in the LISP Machine Flavors system. Though the
Flavors design has been superseded (notably by the Common LISP CLOS
facility), the term flavor is still used as a general synonym for class by
some LISP hackers.
