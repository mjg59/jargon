 :the network: n. 1. Historically, the union of all the major noncommercial,
academic, and hacker-oriented networks, such as Internet, the pre-1990
ARPANET, NSFnet, {BITNET}, and the virtual UUCP and {Usenet} `networks', plus
the corporate in-house networks and commercial time-sharing services (such as
CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to them. A site is generally
considered `on the network' if it can be reached through some combination of
Internet-style (@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path) addresses. see {Internet}, {bang
path}, {{Internet address}}, {network address}. 2. Following the mass-culture
discovery of the Internet in 1994 and subsequent proliferation of cheap
TCP/IP connections, "the network" is increasingly synonymous with the
Internet itself (as it was before the second wave of wide-area computer
networking began around 1980). 3. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian
hacker-subversives and anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert
Anton Wilson's novel "Schro"dinger's Cat", to which many hackers have
subsequently decided they belong (this is an example of {ha ha only
serious}). In sense 1, `the network' is often abbreviated to `the net'. "Are
you on the net?" is a frequent question when hackers first meet face to face,
and "see you on the net!" is a frequent goodbye.
