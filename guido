 :Guido: /gwee´do/, /khwee´do/ Without qualification, Guido van Rossum
(author of {Python}). Note that Guido answers to English /gwee´do/ but in
Dutch it's /khwee´do/. Mythically, Guido's most important attribute besides
Python itself is Guido's time machine, a device he is reputed to possess
because of the unnerving frequency with which user requests for new features
have been met with the response "I just implemented that last night...". see
{BDFL}.
