 EIGHTY-COLUMN MIND [IBM] n. The sort said to be employed by persons for whom
the transition from card to tape was traumatic (nobody has dared tell them
about disks yet). It is said that these people, like (according to an old
joke) the founder of IBM, will be buried `9-EDGE-FORWARD-FACE-DOWN'. These
people are thought by most hackers to dominate IBM's customer base, and its
thinking.
