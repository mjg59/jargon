 :number-crunching: n. [common] Computations of a numerical nature, esp.
those that make extensive use of floating-point numbers. The only thing
{Fortrash} is good for. This term is in widespread informal use outside
hackerdom and even in mainstream slang, but has additional hackish
connotations: namely, that the computations are mindless and involve massive
use of {brute force}. This is not always {evil}, esp. if it involves ray
tracing or fractals or some other use that makes {pretty pictures}, esp. if
such pictures can be used as screen backgrounds. see also {crunch}.
