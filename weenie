 :weenie: n. 1. [on BBSes] Any of a species of luser resembling a less
amusing version of {BIFF} that infests many {BBS} systems. The typical weenie
is a teenage boy with poor social skills travelling under a grandiose
{handle} derived from fantasy or heavy-metal rock lyrics. Among sysops, `the
weenie problem' refers to the marginally literate and profanity-laden
{flamage} weenies tend to spew all over a newly-discovered BBS. Compare
{spod}, {computer geek}, {terminal junkie}. 2. [Among hackers] When used with
a qualifier (for example, as in {UNIX weenie}, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this
can be either an insult or a term of praise, depending on context, tone of
voice, and whether or not it is applied by a person who considers him or
herself to be the same sort of weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a
major investment of time, effort, and concentration into the area indicated;
whether this is positive or negative depends on the hearer's judgment of how
the speaker feels about that area. see also {bigot}. 3. The semicolon
character, `;' (ASCII 0111011).
