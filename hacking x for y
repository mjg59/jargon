 :Hacking X for Y: [ITS] n. The information ITS made publicly available about
each user (the INQUIR record) was a sort of form in which the user could fill
out fields. On display, two of these fields were combined into a project
description of the form "Hacking X for Y" (e.g., `"Hacking perceptrons for
Minsky"'). This form of description became traditional and has since been
carried over to other systems with more general facilities for
self-advertisement (such as UNIX {plan file}s).
