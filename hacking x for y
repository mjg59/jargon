 :Hacking X for Y: n. [ITS] Ritual phrasing of part of the information which
ITS made publicly available about each user. This information (the INQUIR
record) was a sort of form in which the user could fill out various fields.
On display, two of these fields were always combined into a project
description of the form "Hacking X for Y" (e.g., `"Hacking perceptrons for
Minsky"'). This form of description became traditional and has since been
carried over to other systems with more general facilities for
self-advertisement (such as Unix {plan file}s).
