 :flash crowd: Larry Niven's 1973 SF short story Flash Crowd predicted that
one consequence of cheap teleportation would be huge crowds materializing
almost instantly at the sites of interesting news stories. Twenty years later
the term passed into common use on the Internet to describe exponential
spikes in website or server usage when one passes a certain threshold of
popular interest (what this does to the server may also be called {slashdot
effect}). It has been pointed out that the effect was anticipated years
earlier in Alfred Bester's 1956 The Stars My Destination.
