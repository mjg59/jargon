 :dogfood: n. [Microsoft, Netscape] Interim software used internally for
testing. "To eat one's own dogfood" (from which the slang noun derives) means
to use the software one is developing, as part of one's everyday development
environment (the phrase is used outside Microsoft and Netscape). The practice
is normal in the Linux community and elsewhere, but the term `dogfood' is
seldom used as open-source betas tend to be quite tasty and nourishing. The
idea is that developers who are using their own software will quickly learn
what's missing or broken. Dogfood is typically not even of {beta} quality.
