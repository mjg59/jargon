 :filk: /filk/, n.,v. [from SF fandom, where a typo for `folk' was adopted as
a new word] Originally, a popular or folk song with lyrics revised or
completely new lyrics and/or music, intended for humorous effect when read,
and/or to be sung late at night at SF conventions. More recently (especially
since the late 1980s), filk has come to include a great deal of
originally-composed music on SFnal or fantasy themes and a range of moods
wider than simple parody or humor. Worthy of mention here because there is a
flourishing subgenre of filks called computer filks, written by hackers and
often containing rather sophisticated technical humor. see {double bucky} for
an example. Compare {grilf}, {hing}, {pr0n}, and {newsfroup}.
