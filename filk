 FILK /filk/ [from SF fandom, where a typo for "folk" was adopted as a new
word] n.,v. A "filk" is a popular or folk song with lyrics revised or
completely new lyrics, intended for humorous effect when read and/or to be
sung late at night at SF conventions. There is a flourishing subgenre of
these called "computer filks", written by hackers and often containing
technical humor of quite sophisticated nature. see DOUBLE BUCKY for an
example.
