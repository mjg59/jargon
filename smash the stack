 :smash the stack: /n./ [C programming] To corrupt the execution stack by
writing past the end of a local array or other data structure. Code that
smashes the stack can cause a return from the routine to jump to a random
address, resulting in some of the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to
mankind. Variants include `trash' the stack, {scribble} the stack, {mangle}
the stack; the term **{mung} the stack is not used, as this is never done
intentionally. see {spam}; see also {aliasing bug}, {fandango on core},
{memory leak}, {memory smash}, {precedence lossage}, {overrun screw}.
