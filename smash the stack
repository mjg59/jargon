 :smash the stack: [C programming] n. On many C implementations it is
possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past the end of an array
declared `auto' in a routine. Code that does this is said to `smash the
stack', and can cause return from the routine to jump to a random address.
This can produce some of the most insidious data-dependent bugs known to
mankind. Variants include `trash' the stack, {scribble} the stack, {mangle}
the stack; the term *{mung} the stack is not used, as this is never done
intentionally. see {spam}; see also {aliasing bug}, {fandango on core},
{memory leak}, {memory smash}, {precedence lossage}, {overrun screw}.
