 SMASH THE STACK (smash dh@ stak) [C programming] n. On many C
implementations it is possible to corrupt the execution stack by writing past
the end of an array declared auto in a routine. Code that does this is said
to `smash the stack', and can cause return from the routine to jump to a
random text address. This can produce some of the most insidious
data-dependent bugs known to mankind. Variants include `trash the stack',
`SCRIBBLE ON the stack', `MANGLE the stack'; `*MUNG the stack' is not used as
this is never done intentionally. see ALIASING SCREW, FANDANGO ON CORE,
