 :blurgle: /bler'gl/ /n./ [UK] Spoken {metasyntactic variable}, to indicate
some text that is obvious from context, or which is already known. If several
words are to be replaced, blurgle may well be doubled or tripled. "To look
for something in several files use `grep string blurgle blurgle'." In each
case, "blurgle blurgle" would be understood to be replaced by the file you
wished to search. Compare {mumble}, sense 7.
