 :T: /T/ 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes. Used in reply to a
question (particularly one asked using the `-P' convention). In LISP, the
constant T means `true', among other things. Some hackers use `T' and `NIL'
instead of `Yes' and `No' almost reflexively. This sometimes causes
misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker
wants coffee, he may well respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee; but of
course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. As it happens, most hackers
(particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants) like tea at least as
well as coffee --- so it is not that big a problem. 2. see {time T} (also
{since time T equals minus infinity}). 3. [techspeak] In
transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for the noun `transaction'.
4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of {tee}. 5. A dialect of {LISP} developed at
Yale.
