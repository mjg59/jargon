 T /tee/ 1. [from LISP terminology for "true"] Yes. Usage: used in reply to a
question, particularly one asked using the "-P" convention). see NIL. In
LISP, the name T means "true", among other things. Some hackers use "T" and
"NIL" instead of "yes" and "no" almost reflexively. This sometimes causes
misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker
wants coffee, he may well respond "T", meaning that he wants coffee; but of
course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. As it happens, most hackers
like tea at least as well as coffee, particularly those who frequent Chinese
restaurants, so it's not that big a problem. 2. see TIME T. 3. In
transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for the noun "transaction".
4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of TEE (q.v.)
