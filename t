 :T: /T/ 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes. Used in reply to a
question (particularly one asked using The -P convention). In LISP, the
constant T means `true', among other things. Some Lisp hackers use `T' and
`NIL' instead of `Yes' and `No' almost reflexively. This sometimes causes
misunderstandings. When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker
wants coffee, he may absently respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee; but
of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead. Fortunately, most hackers
(particularly those who frequent Chinese restaurants) like tea at least as
well as coffee -- so it is not that big a problem. 2. see {time T} (also
{since time T equals minus infinity}). 3. [techspeak] In
transaction-processing circles, an abbreviation for the noun `transaction'.
4. [Purdue] Alternate spelling of {tee}. 5. A dialect of {LISP} developed at
Yale. (There is an intended allusion to NIL, "New Implementation of Lisp",
another dialect of Lisp developed for the {VAX})
