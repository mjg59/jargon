 :sponge: [UNIX] n. A special case of a {filter} that reads its entire input
before writing any output; the canonical example is a sort utility. Unlike
most filters, a sponge can conveniently overwrite the input file with the
output data stream. If your file system has versioning (as ITS did and VMS
does now) the sponge/filter distinction loses its usefulness, because
directing filter output would just write a new version. see also {slurp}.
