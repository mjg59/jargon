 :Ada:: n. A {{Pascal}}-descended language that was at one time made
mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the Pentagon.
Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that, technically, it is precisely
what one might expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; bloated,
crockish, difficult to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar
boondoggle (one common description was "The PL/I of the 1980s"). The kindest
thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good small
language screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk.
