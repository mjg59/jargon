 :Ada:: /n./ A {{Pascal}}-descended language that has been made mandatory for
Department of Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers are nearly
unanimous in observing that, technically, it is precisely what one might
expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee,
crockish, difficult to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar
boondoggle (one common description is "The PL/I of the 1980s"). Hackers find
Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication features
particularly hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became
the world's first programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the
design of his mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost
certainly blanch at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the
kindest thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good
small language screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk.
