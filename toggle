 :toggle: /vt./ To change a {bit} from whatever state it is in to the other
state; to change from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1. This comes from `toggle
switches', such as standard light switches, though the word `toggle' actually
refers to the mechanism that keeps the switch in the position to which it is
flipped rather than to the fact that the switch has two positions. There are
four things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or zero)
it, leave it alone, or toggle it. (Mathematically, one would say that there
are four distinct boolean-valued functions of one boolean argument, but
saying that is much less fun than talking about toggling bits.)
