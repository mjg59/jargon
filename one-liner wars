 :one-liner wars: n. A game popular among hackers who code in the language
APL (see {write-only language} and {line noise}). The objective is to see who
can code the most interesting and/or useful routine in one line of operators
chosen from APL's exceedingly {hairy} primitive set. A similar amusement was
practiced among {TECO} hackers and is now popular among {Perl} aficionados.
Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL, has been credited with a one-liner that,
given a number N, produces a list of the prime numbers from 1 to N inclusive.
It looks like this: (2 = 0 +.= T o.| T) / T <- iN where `o' is the APL null
character, the assignment arrow is a single character, and `i' represents the
APL iota. Here's a {Perl} program that prints primes: perl -wle '(1 x $_) !~
/^(11+)\1+$/ && print while ++ $_' In the Perl world this game is sometimes
called Perl Golf because the player with the fewest (key)strokes wins.
