 ONE-LINER WARS (wuhn-lie'nr worz) n. Popular game among hackers who code in
the language APL. The objective is to see who can code the most interesting
and/or useful routine in one line of operators chosen from APL's exceedingly
HAIRY primitive set. [This is not *quite* as silly as it sounds; I myself
have coded one-line LIFE programs and once uttered a one-liner that performed
lexical analysis of its input string followed by a dictionary lookup for good
measure -- ESR]
