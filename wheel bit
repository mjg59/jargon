 :wheel bit: /n./ A privilege bit that allows the possessor to perform some
restricted operation on a timesharing system, such as read or write any file
on the system regardless of protections, change or look at any address in the
running monitor, crash or reload the system, and kill or create jobs and user
accounts. The term was invented on the TENEX operating system, and carried
over to TOPS-20, XEROX-IFS, and others. The state of being in a privileged
logon is sometimes called `wheel mode'. This term entered the Unix culture
from TWENEX in the mid-1980s and has been gaining popularity there (esp. at
university sites). see also {root}.
