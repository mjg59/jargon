 :handle: n. 1. [from CB slang] An electronic pseudonym; a `nom de guerre'
intended to conceal the user's true identity. Network and BBS handles
function as the same sort of simultaneous concealment and display one finds
on Citizen's Band radio, from which the term was adopted. Use of grandiose
handles is characteristic of {warez d00dz}, {cracker}s, {weenie}s, {spod}s,
and other lower forms of network life; true hackers travel on their own
reputations rather than invented legendry. Compare {nick}, {screen name}. 2.
A {magic cookie}, often in the form of a numeric index into some array
somewhere, through which you can manipulate an object like a file or window.
The form `file handle' is especially common. 3. [Mac] A pointer to a pointer
to dynamically-allocated memory; the extra level of indirection allows
on-the-fly memory compaction (to cut down on fragmentation) or aging out of
unused resources, with minimal impact on the (possibly multiple) parts of the
larger program containing references to the allocated memory. Compare {snap}
(to snap a handle would defeat its purpose); see also {aliasing bug},
{dangling pointer}.
