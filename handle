 :handle: [from CB slang] n. An electronic pseudonym; a `nom de guerre'
intended to conceal the user's true identity. Network and BBS handles
function as the same sort of simultaneous concealment and display one finds
on Citizen's Band radio, from which the term was adopted. Use of grandiose
handles is characteristic of {cracker}s, {weenie}s, {spod}s, and other lower
forms of network life; true hackers travel on their own reputations rather
than invented legendry.
