 :ill-behaved: adj. 1. [numerical analysis] Said of an algorithm or
computational method that tends to blow up because of accumulated roundoff
error or poor convergence properties. 2. [obs.] Software that bypasses the
defined {OS} interfaces to do things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O)
itself, often in a way that depends on the hardware of the machine it is
running on or which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of
software. In the MS-DOS world, there was a folk theorem (nearly true) to the
effect that (owing to gross inadequacies and performance penalties in the OS
interface) all interesting applications were ill-behaved. see also {bare
metal}. Oppose {well-behaved}. see also {mess-dos}. 3. In modern usage, a
program is called ill-behaved if it uses interfaces to the OS or other
programs that are private, undocumented, or grossly non-portable. Another way
to be ill-behaved is to use headers or files that are theoretically private
to another application.
