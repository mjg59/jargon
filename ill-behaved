 :ill-behaved: adj. 1. [numerical analysis] Said of an algorithm or
computational method that tends to blow up because of accumulated roundoff
error or poor convergence properties. 2. Software that bypasses the defined
{OS} interfaces to do things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself,
often in a way that depends on the hardware of the machine it is running on
or which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of software. In the
IBM PC/MS-DOS world, there is a folk theorem (nearly true) to the effect that
(owing to gross inadequacies and performance penalties in the OS interface)
all interesting applications are ill-behaved. see also {bare metal}. Oppose
{well-behaved}, compare {PC-ism}. see {mess-dos}.
