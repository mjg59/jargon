 :Kool-Aid: [from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity flavors] When
someone who should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually
begins to believe the propaganda being dished out by a vendor, they are said
to have drunk the Kool-Aid. Usually the decortication process is slow and
almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a True Believer and
begins spreading the faith himself. The term originates in the suicide of 914
followers of Jim Jones's People's Temple cult in Guyana in 1978 (there are
also resonances with Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests from the
1960s). What the Jonestown victims actually drank was cyanide-laced
Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff, rather than Kool-Aid itself. There is a FAQ on
this topic. This has live variants. When a suit is blithering on about their
latest technology and how it will save the world, that's `pouring Kool-Aid'.
When the suit does not violate the laws of physics, doesn't make impossible
claims, and in fact says something reasonable and believable, that's pouring
good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence "He pours good Kool-Aid, doesn't
he?" This connotes that the speaker might be about to drink same.
