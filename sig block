 :sig block: /sig blok/, n. [Internet and Usenet; often written `.sig' there]
Short for `signature', used specifically to refer to the electronic signature
block that most Unix mail- and news-posting software will {automagically}
append to outgoing mail and news. The composition of one's sig can be quite
an art form, including an ASCII logo, one's choice of witty sayings (see {sig
quote}, {fool file}), or even source code for small programs about which the
author wishes to make a statement; but many consider large sigs a waste of
{bandwidth}, and it has been observed that the size of one's sig block is
usually inversely proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on
the net. see also {doubled sig}, {McQuary limit}.
