 :sig block: /sig blok/ [UNIX; often written `.sig' there] n. Short for
`signature', used specifically to refer to the electronic signature block
that most UNIX mail- and news-posting software will {automagically} append to
outgoing mail and news. The composition of one's sig can be quite an art
form, including an ASCII logo or one's choice of witty sayings (see {sig
quote}, {fool file, the}); but many consider large sigs a waste of
{bandwidth}, and it has been observed that the size of one's sig block is
usually inversely proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on
the net. see also {doubled sig}.
