 UNWIND THE STACK v. 1. During the execution of a procedural language one is
said to `unwind the stack' from a called procedure up to a caller when one
discards the stack frame and any number of frames above it, popping back up
to the level of the given caller. In C this is done with longjmp/setjmp; in
LISP with THROW/CATCH. This is sometimes necessary when handling exceptional
conditions. see also SMASH THE STACK. 2. People can unwind the stack as well,
by quickly dealing with a bunch of problems "Oh hell, let's do lunch. Just a
second while I unwind my stack".
