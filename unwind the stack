 :unwind the stack: vi. 1. [techspeak] During the execution of a procedural
language, one is said to `unwind the stack' from a called procedure up to a
caller when one discards the stack frame and any number of frames above it,
popping back up to the level of the given caller. In C this is done with
`longjmp'/`setjmp', in LISP or C++ with `throw/catch'. see also {smash the
stack}. 2. People can unwind the stack as well, by quickly dealing with a
bunch of problems: "Oh heck, let's do lunch. Just a second while I unwind my
stack."
