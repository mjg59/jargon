 :TCP/IP: /T'C-P I'P/ n. 1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol]
The wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and the only
one most hackers can speak the name of without laughing or retching. Unlike
such allegedly `standard' competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO
7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being _used_, rather than
being handed down from on high by a vendor or a heavily-politicized standards
committee. Consequently, it (a) works, (b) actually promotes cheap
cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the hell out of corporate and
governmental empire-builders everywhere. Hackers value all three of these
properties. see {creationism}. 2. [Amateur Packet Radio] Formerly expanded as
"The Crap Phil Is Pushing". The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the
context was an ongoing technical/political war between the majority of sites
still running AX.25 and the TCP/IP relays. TCP/IP won.
