 :true-hacker: [analogy with `trufan' from SF fandom] n. One who exemplifies
the primary values of hacker culture, esp. competence and helpfulness to
other hackers. A high compliment. "He spent 6 hours helping me bring up UUCP
and netnews on my FOOBAR 4000 last week --- manifestly the act of a
true-hacker." Compare {demigod}, oppose {munchkin}.
