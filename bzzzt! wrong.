 :Bzzzt! Wrong.: /bzt rong/, excl. [common; Usenet/Internet; punctuation
varies] From a Robin Williams routine in the movie Dead Poets Society
spoofing radio or TV quiz programs, such as Truth or Consequences, where an
incorrect answer earns one a blast from the buzzer and condolences from the
interlocutor. A way of expressing mock-rude disagreement, usually immediately
following an included quote from another poster. The less abbreviated
"*Bzzzzt*, wrong, but thank you for playing" is also common; capitalization
and emphasis of the buzzer sound varies. C C C Programmer's Disease C&C C++
