 :numbers: n. [scientific computation] Output of a computation that may not
be significant results but at least indicate that the program is running. May
be used to placate management, grant sponsors, etc. Making numbers means
running a program because output -- any output, not necessarily meaningful
output -- is needed as a demonstration of progress. see {pretty pictures},
{math-out}, {social science number}.
