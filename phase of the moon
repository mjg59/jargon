 PHASE OF THE MOON n. Used humorously as a random parameter on which
something is said to depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is
dependent, or that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has
been able to determine. "This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon."
