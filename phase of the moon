 PHASE OF THE MOON n. Used humorously as a random parameter on which
something is said to depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is
dependent, or that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has
been able to determine. "This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon." True
story: Once upon a time, a program written by Gerry Sussman (professor of
Electrical Engineering at MIT) and Guy Steele had a bug that really did
depend on the phase of the moon! There is a little subroutine that had
traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
approximation to the moon's true phase; the phase is then printed out at the
top of program listings, for example, along with the date and time, purely
for fun. (Actually, since hackers spend a lot of time indoors, this might be
the only way they would ever know what the moon's phase was!) Steele
incorporated this routine into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file,
would print a `timestamp" line almost 80 characters long. Very occasionally
the first line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the
next line, and when the file was later read back in the program would BARF.
The length of the first line depended on the precise time when the timestamp
was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!
