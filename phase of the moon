 :phase of the moon: n. Used humorously as a random parameter on which
something is said to depend. Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is
dependent, or that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has
been able to determine. "This feature depends on having the channel open in
mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the moon." True
story: Once upon a time there was a bug that really did depend on the phase
of the moon. There is a little subroutine that had traditionally been used in
various programs at MIT to calculate an approximation to the moon's true
phase. GLS incorporated this routine into a LISP program that, when it wrote
out a file, would print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long. Very
occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and would
overflow onto the next line, and when the file was later read back in the
program would {barf}. The length of the first line depended on both the
precise date and time and the length of the phase specification when the
timestamp was printed, and so the bug literally depended on the phase of the
moon! The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
typesetter `corrected' it. This has since been described as the
phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.
