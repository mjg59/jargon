 :ANSI: /an'see/ 1. n. [techspeak] The American National Standards Institute.
ANSI, along with the International Organization for Standards (ISO),
standardized the C programming language (see {K&R}, {Classic C}), and
promulgates many other important software standards. 2. n. [techspeak] A
terminal may be said to be `ANSI' if it meets the ANSI X3.64 standard for
terminal control. Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and
too permissive. It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48 standard,
which shares both flaws. 3. n. [BBS jargon] The set of screen-painting codes
that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept. This comes from the ANSI.SYS
device driver that must be loaded on an MS-DOS computer to view such codes.
Unfortunately, neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly
match the ANSI X3.64 terminal standard. For example, the ESC-[1m code turns
on the bold highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns
on `intense' (bright) colors. Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is often
used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate the IBM
high-half character set from MS-DOS. Particular use depends on context.
Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set is used with the color codes,
but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go together.
