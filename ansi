 :Format For New Entries: ======================== You can mail submissions
for the Jargon File to <jargon@snark.thyrsus.com>. We welcome new jargon, and
corrections to or amplifications of existing entries. You can improve your
submission's chances of being included by adding background information on
user population and years of currency. References to actual usage via URLs
and/or DejaNews pointers are particularly welcomed. All contributions and
suggestions about the Jargon File will be considered donations to be placed
in the public domain as part of this File, and may be used in subsequent
paper editions. Submissions may be edited for accuracy, clarity and
concision. We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties
covered. There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the
scientific computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in
numerical analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language design,
and many other related fields. Send us your jargon! We are _not_ interested
in straight technical terms explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries
unless an entry illuminates `underground' meanings or aspects not covered by
official histories. We are also not interested in `joke' entries -- there is
a lot of humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations
of what hackers do and how they think. It is OK to submit items of jargon you
have originated if they have spread to the point of being used by people who
are not personally acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by
independent submission from two different sites. An HTML version of the File
is available at http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon. Please send us URLs for
materials related to the entries, so we can enrich the File's link structure.
The Jargon File will be regularly maintained and made available for browsing
on the World Wide Web, and will include a version number. Read it, pass it
around, contribute -- this is _your_ monument! The Jargon Lexicon
****************** = 0 = ===== :0: Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O'
(the 15th letter of the English alphabet). In their unmodified forms they
look a lot alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct
have compounded the confusion. If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is
not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an
American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a
modern character display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as
an option on IBM 3270 controllers). If your zero is slashed but letter-O is
not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set descended from
the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for
whom /O is a letter, curse this arrangement). If letter-O has a slash across
it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention
used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse
_this_ arrangement even more, because it means two of their letters collide).
Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a _reversed_ slash. Old
CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken
at upper right and lower left. And yet another convention common on early
line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O
so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O (this was
endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII characters, but the
final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left
corner). Are we sufficiently confused yet? :1TBS: // n. The "One True Brace
Style"; see {indent style}. :120 reset: /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ n. [from 120
volts, U.S. wall voltage] To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or
unjam it. Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power cycle}. :2: infix. In translation
software written by hackers, infix 2 often represents the syllable _to_ with
the connotation `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string
(integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff). Several versions of
a joke have floated around the internet in which some idiot programmer fixes
the Y2K bug by changing all the Y's in something to K's, as in Januark,
Februark, etc. :404: // n. [from the HTTP error "file not found on server"]
Extended to humans to convey that the subject has no idea or no clue -
sapience not found. May be used reflexively; "Uh, I'm 404ing" means "I'm
drawing a blank". :404 compliant: adj. The status of a website which has been
completely removed, usually by the administrators of the hosting site as a
result of net abuse by the website operators. The term is a tongue-in-cheek
reference to the standard "301 compliant" Murkowski Bill disclaimer used by
spammers. see also: {spam}, {spamvertize}. :4.2: /for' poynt too'/ n. Without
a prefix, this almost invariably refers to {BSD} Unix release 4.2. Note that
it is an indication of cluelessness to say "version 4.2", and "release 4.2"
is rare; the number stands on its own, or is used in the more explicit forms
4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2. Similar remarks apply to "4.3", "4.4" and
to earlier, less-widespread releases 4.1 and 2.9. :@-party: /at'par`tee/ n.
[from the @-sign in an Internet address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n
par`tee/) A semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or "Worldcon");
one must have a {network address} to get in, or at least be in company with
someone who does. One of the most reliable opportunities for hackers to meet
face to face with people who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor
dots on their screens. Compare {boink}. The first recorded @-party was held
at the Westercon (a California
