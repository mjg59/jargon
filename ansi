 ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom /O is a letter, curse this
arrangement). (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers;
Florian Cajori's monumental "A History of Mathematical Notations" notes that
it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has a slash
across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old
convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians
curse _this_ arrangement even more, because it means two of their letters
collide). Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a _reversed_
slash. Old CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an
oval broken at upper right and lower left. And yet another convention common
on early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the
letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O (this
was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII characters, but
the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left
corner). Are we sufficiently confused yet? :1TBS: // n. The "One True Brace
Style"; see {indent style}. :120 reset: /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ n. [from 120
volts, U.S. wall voltage] To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or
unjam it. Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power cycle}. :2: infix. In translation
software written by hackers, infix 2 often represents the syllable _to_ with
the connotation `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string
(integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff). Several versions of
a joke have floated around the internet in which some idiot programmer fixes
the Y2K bug by changing all the Y's in something to K's, as in Januark,
Februark, etc. :404: // n. [from the HTTP error "file not found on server"]
Extended to humans to convey that the subject has no idea or no clue -
sapience not found. May be used reflexively; "Uh, I'm 404ing" means "I'm
drawing a blank". :404 compliant: adj. The status of a website which has been
completely removed, usually by the administrators of the hosting site as a
result of net abuse by the website operators. The term is a tongue-in-cheek
reference to the standard "301 compliant" Murkowski Bill disclaimer used by
spammers. see also: {spam}, {spamvertize}. :4.2: /for' poynt too'/ n. Without
a prefix, this almost invariably refers to {BSD} Unix release 4.2. Note that
it is an indication of cluelessness to say "version 4.2", and "release 4.2"
is rare; the number stands on its own, or is used in the more explicit forms
4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2. Similar remarks apply to "4.3", "4.4" and
to earlier, less-widespread releases 4.1 and 2.9. :@-party: /at'par`tee/ n.
[from the @-sign in an Internet address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n
par`tee/) A semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or "Worldcon");
one must have a {network address} to get in, or at least be in company with
someone who does. One of the most reliable opportunities for hackers to meet
face to face with people who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor
dots on their screens. Compare {boink}. The first recorded @-party was held
at the Westercon (a U.S. western regional SF convention) over the July 4th
weekend in 1980. It is not clear exactly when the canonical @-party venue
shifted to the Worldcon but it had certainly become established by
Constellation in 1983. Sadly, the @-party tradition has been in decline since
about 1996, mainly because having an @-address no longer functions as an
effective lodge pin. = A = ===== :abbrev: /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ n. Common
abbreviation for `abbreviation'. :ABEND: /a'bend/, /*-bend'/ n. [ABnormal
END] 1. Abnormal termination (of software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives from
an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but seriously
mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually capitalized, but may appear as `abend'.
Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is called `abend' because it is
what system operators do to the machine late on Friday when they want to call
it a day, and hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'. 2.
