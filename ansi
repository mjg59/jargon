 :ANSI: n. /an'see/ 1. n. The American National Standards Institue. ANSI,
along with the International Standards Organization (ISO) standardized the C
programming language (see {K&R}, {Classic C}), and promulgates many other
important software standards. 2. n. [BBS] The set of screen-painting codes
that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept. This comes from the ANSI.SYS
device driver that must be loaded on an MS-DOS computer to view such codes.
Unfortunately, neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly
match the ANSI terminal standard. For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the
bold highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on
`intense' (bright) colors. Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is often used
to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate the IBM high-half
character set from MS-DOS. Particular use depends on context. Occasionally,
the vanilla ASCII character set is used with the color codes, but on BBSs,
ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go together.
