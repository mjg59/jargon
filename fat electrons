 :fat electrons: n. Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on the causation
of computer glitches. Your typical electric utility draws its line current
out of the big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the top of
the dynamo. When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line to
clean them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the *bottom* of the coil.
Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary or
`thin' electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so
settle to the bottom of the generator. These flow down ordinary wires just
fine, but when they have to turn a sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit
via), they're apt to get stuck. This is what causes computer glitches.
[Fascinating. Obviously, fat electrons must gain mass by {bogon} absorption
-- ESR] Compare {bogon}, {magic smoke}.
