 :atomic: [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible] adj. Indivisible; cannot be split
up. For example, an instruction may be said to do several things
`atomically', i.e., all the things are done immediately, and there is no
chance of the instruction being half-completed. Esp. used to convey that an
operation cannot be screwed up by interrupts. "This routine locks the file
and increments the file's semaphore atomically." This usage has none of the
connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e. of particles of
matter, nuclear explosions etc.).
