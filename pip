 PIP: /pip/ [Peripheral Interchange Program] vt.,obs. To copy; from the
program PIP on CP/M, RSX-11, RSTS/E, and OS/8 (derived from a utility on the
PDP-6) that was used for file copying (and in OS/8 and RT-11 for just about
every other file operation you might want to do). It is said that when the
program was originated, during the development of the PDP-6 in 1963, it was
called ATLATL (`Anything, Lord, to Anything, Lord'). pistol: [IBM] n. A tool
that makes it all too easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot. "UNIX `rm
*' makes such a nice pistol!" pizza box: [Sun] n. The largish thin box
housing the electronics in (especially Sun) desktop workstations, so named
because of its size and shape and the dimpled pattern that looks like air
holes. Two meg single-platter removable disk packs used to be called pizzas,
and the huge drive they were stuck into was referred to as a pizza oven. It's
an index of progress that in the old days just the disk was pizza-sized,
while now the entire computer is. pizza, ANSI standard: /an'see stan'd*rd
peet'z*/ [CMU] Pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Coined allegedly because most
pizzas ordered by CMU hackers during some period leading up to mid-1990 were
of that flavor. see also {rotary debugger}; compare {tea, ISO standard cup
of}. plain-ASCII: /playn-as'kee/ Syn. {flat-ASCII}. plan file: [UNIX] n. On
systems that support {finger}, the `.plan' file in a user's home directory is
displayed when the user is fingered. This feature was originally intended to
be used to keep potential fingerers apprised of one's location and
near-future plans, but has been turned almost universally to humorous and
self-expressive purposes (like a {sig block}). see {Hacking X for Y}.
platinum-iridium: adj. Standard, against which all others of the same
category are measured. Usage: silly. The notion is that one of whatever it is
has actually been cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault
beside the Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures near Paris. (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the
distance between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that vault
--- this replaced an earlier definition as 10^7 times the distance between
the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris; unfortunately,
this had been based on an inexact value of the circumference of the Earth.
From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be 1650763.73 wavelengths of the
orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating in a vacuum. It is now defined as
the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in the time interval of
1/299,792,458 of a second. The kilogram is now the only unit of measure
officially defined in terms of a unique artifact.) "This garbage-collection
algorithm has been tested against the platinum-iridium cons cell in Paris."
Compare {golden}. playpen: [IBM] n. A room where programmers work. Compare
{salt mines}. playte: /playt/ 16 bits, by analogy with {nybble} and {{byte}}.
Usage: rare and extremely silly. see also {dynner} and {crumb}. plingnet:
/pling'net/ n. Syn. {UUCPNET}. Also see {{Commonwealth Hackish}}, which uses
`pling' for {bang} (as in {bang path}). plokta: /plok't*/ [Acronym for `Press
Lots Of Keys To Abort'] v. To press random keys in an attempt to get some
response from the system. One might plokta when the abort procedure for a
program is not known, or when trying to figure out if the system is just
sluggish or really hung. Plokta can also be used while trying to figure out
any unknown key sequence for a particular operation. Someone going into
`plokta mode' usually places both hands flat on the keyboard and presses
down, hoping for some useful response. plonk: [USENET: possibly influenced by
British slang `plonk' for cheap booze] The sound a {newbie} makes as he falls
to the bottom of a {kill file}. Used almost exclusively in the {newsgroup}
talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") is a form of public
ridicule. plugh: /ploogh/ [from the {ADVENT} game] v. see {xyzzy}. plumbing:
[UNIX] n. Term used for {shell} code, so called because of the prevalence of
`pipelines' that feed the output of one program to the input of another.
Under UNIX, user utilities can often be implemented or at least prototyped by
a suitable collection of pipelines and temp-file grinding encapsulated in a
shell script; this is much less effort than writing C every time, and the
capability is considered one of UNIX's major winning features. Esp. used in
the construction `hairy plumbing' (see {hairy}). "You can kluge together a
basic spell-checker out of `sort(1)', `comm(1)', and `tr(1)' with a little
plumbing." see also {tee}.
