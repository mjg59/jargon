 :PIP: /pip/ [Peripheral Interchange Program] vt.,obs. To copy; from the
program PIP on CP/M, RSX-11, RSTS/E, TOPS-10, and OS/8 (derived from a
utility on the PDP-6) that was used for file copying (and in OS/8 and RT-11
for just about every other file operation you might want to do). It is said
that when the program was originated, during the development of the PDP-6 in
1963, it was called ATLATL (`Anything, Lord, to Anything, Lord'; this played
on the Nahuatl word `atlatl' for a spear-thrower, with connotations of
utility and primitivity that were no doubt quite intentional).
