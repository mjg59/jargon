 :kluge up: /vt./ To lash together a quick hack to perform a task; this is
milder than {cruft together} and has some of the connotations of {hack up}
(note, however, that the construction `kluge on' corresponding to {hack on}
is never used). "I've kluged up this routine to dump the buffer contents to a
safe place."
