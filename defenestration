 :defenestration: n. [from the traditional Czechoslovakian method of
assassinating prime ministers, via SF fandom] 1. Proper karmic retribution
for an incorrigible punster. "Oh, ghod, that was *awful*!" "Quick!
Defenestrate him!" 2. The act of exiting a window system in order to get

window. 3. The act of discarding something under the assumption that it will
improve matters. "I don't have any disk space left." "Well, why don't you
