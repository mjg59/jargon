 :kit: [USENET; poss. fr. DEC slang for a full software distribution, as
opposed to a patch or upgrade] n. A source software distribution that has
been packaged in such a way that it can (theoretically) be unpacked and
installed according to a series of steps using only standard UNIX tools, and
entirely documented by some reasonable chain of references from the top-level
{README file}. The more general term {distribution} may imply that special
tools or more stringent conditions on the host environment are required.
