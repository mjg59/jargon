 :kit: n. [Usenet; poss. fr. DEC slang for a full software distribution, as
opposed to a patch or upgrade] A source software distribution that has been
packaged in such a way that it can (theoretically) be unpacked and installed
according to a series of steps using only standard Unix tools, and entirely
documented by some reasonable chain of references from the top-level {README
file}. The more general term {distribution} may imply that special tools or
more stringent conditions on the host environment are required.
