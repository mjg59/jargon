 :under the hood: prep. [hot-rodder talk] 1. Used to introduce the underlying
implementation of a product (hardware, software, or idea). Implies that the
implementation is not intuitively obvious from the appearance, but the
speaker is about to enable the listener to {grok} it. "Let's now look under
the hood to see how ...." 2. Can also imply that the implementation is much
simpler than the appearance would indicate: "Under the hood, we are just
fork/execing the shell." 3. Inside a chassis, as in "Under the hood, this
baby has a 40MHz 68030!"
