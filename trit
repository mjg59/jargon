 :trit: /trit/ [by analogy with `bit'] n. One base-3 digit; the amount of
information conveyed by a selection among one of three equally likely
outcomes (see also {bit}). Trits arise, for example, in the context of a
{flag} that should actually be able to assume *three* values --- such as yes,
no, or unknown. Trits are sometimes jokingly called `3-state bits'. A trit
may be semi-seriously referred to as `a bit and a half', although it is
linearly equivalent to 1.5849625 bits (that is, log2(3) bits).
