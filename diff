 :diff: /dif/ /n./ 1. A change listing, especially giving differences between
(and additions to) source code or documents (the term is often used in the
plural `diffs'). "Send me your diffs for the Jargon File!" Compare {vdiff}.
2. Specifically, such a listing produced by the `diff(1)' command, esp. when
used as specification input to the `patch(1)' utility (which can actually
perform the modifications; see {patch}). This is a common method of
distributing patches and source updates in the Unix/C world. 3. /v./ To
compare (whether or not by use of automated tools on machine-readable files);
see also {vdiff}, {mod}.
