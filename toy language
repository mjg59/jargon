 :toy language: n. A language useful for instructional purposes or as a
proof-of-concept for some aspect of computer-science theory, but inadequate
for general-purpose programming. {Bad Thing}s can result when a toy language
is promoted as a general purpose solution for programming (see
{bondage-and-discipline language}); the classic example is {Pascal}. Several
moderately well-known formalisms for conceptual tasks such as programming
Turing machines also qualify as toy languages in a less negative sense. see
also {MFTL}.
