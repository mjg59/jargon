 THEOLOGY (thee-o'l@-gee) n. 1. Ironically used to refer to RELIGIOUS ISSUES.
2. Technical fine points of an abstruse nature, esp. those where the
resolution is of theoretical interest but relatively MARGINAL with respect to
actual use of a design or system. Used esp. around software issues with a
heavy AI or language design component. Example: the deep- vs. shallow-binding
debate in the design of dynamically-scoped LISPS.
