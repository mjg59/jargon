 :monty: /mon'tee/ [US Geological Survey] n. A program with a ludicrously
complex user interface written to perform extremely trivial tasks. An example
would be a menu-driven, button clicking, pulldown, pop-up windows program for
listing directories. The original monty was an infamous weather-reporting
program, Monty the Amazing Weather Man, written at the USGS. Monty had a
widget-packed X-window interface with over 200 buttons; and all monty
actually *did* was {FTP} files off the network.
