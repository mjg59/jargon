 :monty: /mon'tee/ n. 1. [US Geological Survey] A program with a ludicrously
complex user interface written to perform extremely trivial tasks. An example
would be a menu-driven, button clicking, pulldown, pop-up windows program for
listing directories. The original monty was an infamous weather-reporting
program, Monty the Amazing Weather Man, written at the USGS. Monty had a
widget-packed X-window interface with over 200 buttons; and all monty
actually *did* was {FTP} files off the network. 2. [Great Britain; commonly
capitalized as `Monty' or as `the Full Monty'] 16 megabytes of memory, when
fitted to an IBM-PC or compatible. A standard PC-compatible using the AT- or
ISA-bus with a normal BIOS cannot access more than 16 megabytes of RAM.
Generally used of a PC, Unix workstation, etc. to mean `fully populated with'
memory, disk-space or some other desirable resource. This usage is possibly
derived from a TV commercial for Del Monte fruit juice, in which one of the
characters insisted on "the full Del Monte". Compare American {moby}.
