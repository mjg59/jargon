 :WYSIAYG: /wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. Describes a user interface under which "What You
see Is *All* You Get"; an unhappy variant of {WYSIWYG}. Visual,
`point-and-shoot'-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves,
but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be
better served by a command-style interface. When this happens, the frustrated
user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used of editors, word
processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG `desktop publishing'
programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small documents with lots
of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like newsletters and
presentation slides. When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other
hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG
limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a command-driven
formatter like {{TeX}} or UNIX's `troff(1)' becomes not just desirable but a
necessity. Compare {YAFIYGI}.
