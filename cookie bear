 :cookie bear: /n.,obs./ Original term, pre-Sesame-Street, for what is now
universally called a {cookie monster}. A correspondent observes "In those
days, hackers were actually getting their yucks from...sit down now...Andy
Williams. Yes, *that* Andy Williams. seems he had a rather hip (by the
standards of the day) TV variety show. One of the best parts of the show was
the recurring `cookie bear' sketch. In these sketches, a guy in a bear suit
tried all sorts of tricks to get a cookie out of Williams. The sketches would
always end with Williams shrieking (and I don't mean figuratively), `No
cookies! Not now, not ever...NEVER!!!' And the bear would fall down. Great
stuff."
