 :text: /n./ 1. [techspeak] Executable code, esp. a `pure code' portion
shared between multiple instances of a program running in a multitasking OS.
Compare {English}. 2. Textual material in the mainstream sense; data in
ordinary {{ASCII}} or {{EBCDIC}} representation (see {flat-ASCII}). "Those
are text files; you can review them using the editor." These two
contradictory senses confuse hackers, too.
