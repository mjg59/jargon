 BLT /bee ell tee/ or (rarely) /belt/ n.,v. 1. Synonym for BLIT. This is the
original form of BLIT and the ancestor of BITBLT (q.v.). In these versions
the usage has outlasted the PDP-10 BLock Transfer instruction for which BLT
derives; nowadays, the assembler mnemonic BLT almost always means `Branch if
Less Than Zero'.
