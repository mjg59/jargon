 :BLT: /B-L-T/, /bl*t/ or (rarely) /belt/ /n.,vt./ Synonym for {blit}. This
is the original form of {blit} and the ancestor of {bitblt}. It referred to
any large bit-field copy or move operation (one resource-intensive
memory-shuffling operation done on pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and
TOPS-10 was sardonically referred to as `The Big BLT'). The jargon usage has
outlasted the {PDP-10} BLock Transfer instruction from which {BLT} derives;
nowadays, the assembler mnemonic {BLT} almost always means `Branch if Less
Than zero'.
