 :dread high-bit disease: n. A condition endemic to PRIME (a.k.a. PR1ME)
minicomputers that results in all the characters having their high (0x80) bit
ON rather than OFF. This of course makes transporting files to other systems
much more difficult, not to mention talking to true 8-bit devices. Folklore
had it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit convention in order to save 25
cents per serial line per machine; PRIME old-timers, on the other hand, claim
they inherited the disease from Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility
requirements and struggled manfully to cure it. Whoever was responsible, this
probably qualifies as one of the most {cretinous} design tradeoffs ever made.
see {meta bit}. A few other machines have exhibited similar brain damage.
