 :dread high-bit disease: /n./ A condition endemic to some now-obsolete
computers and peripherals (including ASR-33 teletypes and PRIME
minicomputers) that results in all characters having their high (0x80) bit
forced on. This of course makes transporting files to other systems much more
difficult, not to mention the problems these machines have talking with true
8-bit devices. This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a.
PR1ME) minicomputers. Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit
convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine; PRIME
old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the disease from
Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled
heroically to cure it. Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies as
one of the most {cretinous} design tradeoffs ever made. see {meta bit}.
