 :disusered: adj. [Usenet] Said of a person whose account on a computer has
been removed, esp. for cause rather than through normal attrition. "He got
disusered when they found out he'd been cracking through the school's
Internet access." The verbal form `disuser' is live but less common. Both
usages probably derive from the DISUSER account status flag on VMS; setting
it disables the account. Compare {star out}.
