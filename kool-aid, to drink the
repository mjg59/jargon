 :Kool-Aid, to drink the: [from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity
flavors] When someone who should know better succumbs to marketing influences
and actually begins to believe the propaganda being dished out by a vendor.
Usually the decortication process is slow and almost unnoticeable until one
day the victim emerges as a True Believer and begins spreading the faith
himself. The term originates in the suicide of 914 followers of Jim Jones's
People's Temple cult in Guyana in 1978. What they actually drank was
cyanide-laced Flavor-Aid, a cheap knockoff, rather than Kool-Aid itself.
There is a FAQ (http://www.cs.ruu.nl/wais/html/na-dir/food/kool-aid-faq.html)
on this topic This has live variants. When a suit is blithering on about
their latest technology and how it will save the world, that's `pouring
Kool-Aid'. When the suit does not violate the laws of physics, doesn't make
impossible claims, and in fact says something reasonable and believable,
that's pouring good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence "He pours good
Kool-Aid, doesn't he?" This onnotes that the speaker might be about to drink
same.
