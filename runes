 RUNES pl.n. 1. Anything that requires HEAVY WIZARDRY or BLACK ART to PARSE;
core dumps, JCL commands, or even code in a language you don't have the
faintest idea how to read. Compare CASTING THE RUNES. 2. Special display
characters (for example, the high-half graphics on an IBM PC). 3. RUNIC adj.
Syn. OBSCURE. VMS fans sometimes refer to UNIX as `Runix'; UNIX fans return
the compliment by expanding VMS to `Vachement Mauvais Systeme'. {= S =}
