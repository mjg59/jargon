 :runes: pl.n. 1. Anything that requires {heavy wizardry} or {black art} to
{parse}: core dumps, JCL commands, APL, or code in a language you haven't a
clue how to read. Not quite as bad as {line noise}, but close. Compare
{casting the runes}, {Great Runes}. 2. Special display characters (for
example, the high-half graphics on an IBM PC). 3. [borderline techspeak]
16-bit characters from the Unicode multilingual character set.
