 :Stone Age: /n.,adj./ 1. In computer folklore, an ill-defined period from
ENIAC (ca. 1943) to the mid-1950s; the great age of electromechanical
{dinosaur}s. Sometimes used for the entire period up to 1960--61 (see {Iron
Age}); however, it is funnier and more descriptive to characterize the latter
period in terms of a `Bronze Age' era of transistor-logic, pre-ferrite-{core}
machines with drum or CRT mass storage (as opposed to just mercury delay
lines and/or relays). see also {Iron Age}. 2. More generally, a pejorative
for any crufty, ancient piece of hardware or software technology. Note that
this is used even by people who were there for the {Stone Age} (sense 1).
