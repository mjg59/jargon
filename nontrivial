 :nontrivial: adj. Requiring real thought or significant computing power.
Often used as an understated way of saying that a problem is quite difficult
or impractical, or even entirely unsolvable ("Proving P=NP is nontrivial").
The preferred emphatic form is `decidedly nontrivial'. see {trivial},
{uninteresting}, {interesting}.
