 GECOS: n. see GCOS. gedanken: /g@-dahn'kn/ adj. Wild-eyed; impractical; not
well-thought-out; untried; untested. `Gedanken' is a German word for
`thought'. A thought experiment is one you carry out in your head. In
physics, the term `gedanken experiment' is used to refer to an experiment
that is impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because you can
reason about it theoretically. (A classic gedanken experiment of relativity
theory involves thinking about a man flying through space in an elevator.)
Gedanken experiments are very useful in physics, but you have to be careful.
It was a gedanken experiment that led Aristotle to conclude that heavy things
always fall faster than light things (he thought about a rock and a feather);
this was accepted until Galileo proved otherwise. Among hackers, however, the
word has a pejorative connotation. It is said of a project, especially one in
artificial intelligence research, which is written up in grand detail
(typically as a Ph.D. thesis) without ever being implemented to any great
extent. Such a project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good
hackers or find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry. A gedanken
thesis is usually marked by an obvious lack of intuition about what is
programmable and what is not, and about what does and does not constitute a
clear specification of an algorithm. geek out: vi. To temporarily enter
techno-nerd mode while in a non-hackish context, for example at parties held
near computer equipment. Especially used when you need to do something highly
technical and don't have time to explain: "Pardon me while I geek out for a
moment." gen: /jen/ n.,v. Short for {generate}, used frequently in both
spoken and written contexts. gender mender: n., A cable connector shell with
either two male or two female connectors on it, used to correct the
mismatches that result when some {loser} didn't understand the RS232C
specification and the distinction between DTE and DCE. Used esp. for RS-232C
parts in either the original D-25 or the IBM PC's bogus D-9 format. Also
called a `gender bender', `gender blender', `sex changer' and even
`homosexual adaptor'; there appears to be some confusion as to whether a
`male homosexual adapter' has pins on both sides (is male) or sockets on both
sides (connects two males) General Public Virus: n. Pejorative name for some
versions of the {GNU} project {copyleft} or General Public License (GPL),
which requires that any tools or {app}s incorporating copylefted code must be
source-distributed on the same counter-commercial terms as GNU stuff. Thus it
is alleged that the copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools,
which may in turn infect other software that reuses any of its code. The Free
Software Foundation's official position as of January 1991 is that copyright
law limits the scope of the GPL to "programs textually incorporating
significant amounts of GNU code", and that the `infection' is not passed on
to third parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted (as in, for example,
use of the Bison parser skeleton). Nevertheless, widespread suspicion that
the {copyleft} language is `boobytrapped' has caused many developers to avoid
using GNU tools and the GPL. generate: vt. To produce something according to
an algorithm or program or set of rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side
effect of the execution of an algorithm or program. The opposite of {parse}.
This term retains its mechanistic connotations (though often humorously) when
used of human behavior. "The guy is rational most of the time, but mention
nuclear energy around him and he'll generate {infinite} flamage." gensym:
[from MacLisp for `Generated Symbol'] 1. v. To invent a new name for
something temporary, in such a way that the name is almost certainly not
already in conflict with one already in use. 2. n. The resulting name. The
canonical form of a gensym is `Gnnnn' where nnnn represents a number; any
LISP hacker would recognize G0093 (for example) as a gensym. 3. A freshly
generated data structure with a gensymmed name. These are useful for storing
or uniquely identifying crufties (see {cruft}). Get a life!: imp.
Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the person to whom you are speaking
has succumbed to terminal geekdom (see {computer geek}). Often heard on
{USENET}, esp. as a way of suggesting that the target is taking some obscure
issue of {theology} too seriously. This exhortation was popularized by
William Shatner on a Saturday Night Live episode in a speech which ended "Get
a *life*!", but some respondents believe it to have been in use before then.
Get a real computer!: imp. Typical hacker response to news that somebody is
having trouble getting work done on a system that (a) is single-tasking, (b)
has no Winchester, or (c) has an address space smaller than 4 megabytes. This
is as of mid-1991; note that the threshold for `real computer' rises with
time, and it may well be (for example) that machines with character-only
displays will be considered `unreal' in a few years. see {essentials}, {bitty
box} and {toy}.
