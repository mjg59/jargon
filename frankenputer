 :Frankenputer: n. 1. A mostly-working computer thrown together from the
spare parts of several machines out of which the {magic smoke} had been let.
Most shops have a closet full of nonworking machines. When a new machine is
needed immediately (for testing, for example) and there is no time (or
budget) to requisition a new box, someone (often an intern) is tasked with
building a Frankenputer. 2. Also used in referring to a machine that once was
a name-brand computer, but has been upgraded long beyond its useful life, to
the point at which the nameplate violates truth-in-advertising laws (e.g., a
Pentium II-class machine inexplicably living in a case marked "Gateway
486/66").
