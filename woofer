 :woofer: n. [University of Waterloo] Some varieties of wide paper for
printers have a perforation 8.5 inches from the left margin that allows the
excess on the right-hand side to be torn off when the print format is 80
columns or less wide. The right-hand excess may be called `woofer'. This term
(like {tweeter}) has been in use at Waterloo since 1972, but is elsewhere
unknown. In audio jargon, the word refers to the bass speaker(s) on a hi-fi.
