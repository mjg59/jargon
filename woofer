 :woofer: [University of Waterloo] n. Some varieties of wide paper for
printers have a perforation 8.5 inches from the left margin that allows the
excess on the right-hand side to be torn off when the print format is 80
columns or less wide. The right-hand excess may be called `woofer'. This term
(like {tweeter}, which see) has been in use at Waterloo since 1972, but is
elsewhere unknown. In audio jargon, the word refers to the bass speaker(s) on
a hi-fi. 2. A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what some
currently non-working feature should do. Hypothetical example: "Using META-F7
{crash}es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but as a workaround you can type CTRL-R,
then SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining {cruft} by hand."
