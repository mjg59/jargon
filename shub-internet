 :Shub-Internet: /shuhb' in't*r-net/ n. [MUD: from H. P. Lovecraft's evil
fictional deity Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat with a Thousand Young] The
harsh personification of the Internet: Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater
of Characters, Avatar of Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous
multi-tendriled entity formed of all the manifold connections of the net. A
sect of MUDders worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing objects and praying for
good connections. To no avail -- its purpose is malign and evil, and it is
the cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in "Freela casts a tac nuke
at Shub-Internet for slowing her down." (A forged response often follows
along the lines of: "Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps
happily.") Also cursed by users of the Web, {FTP} and telnet when the network
lags. The dread name of Shub-Internet is seldom spoken aloud, as it is said
that repeating it three times will cause the being to wake, deep within its
lair beneath the Pentagon. Compare {Random Number God}. [January 1996: It
develops that one of the computer administrators in the basement of the
Pentagon read this entry and fell over laughing. As a result, you too can now
poke Shub-Internet by {ping}ing shub-internet.ims.disa.mil. Compare
{kremvax}. --ESR] [April 1999: shub-internet.ims.disa.mil is no more, alas.
But Shub-Internet lives o^$#$*^ --ESR]
