 :Shub-Internet: /shuhb' in't*r-net/ /n./ [MUD: from H. P. Lovecraft's evil
fictional deity Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat with a Thousand Young] The
harsh personification of the Internet, Beast of a Thousand Processes, Eater
of Characters, Avatar of Line Noise, and Imp of Call Waiting; the hideous
multi-tendriled entity formed of all the manifold connections of the net. A
sect of MUDders worships Shub-Internet, sacrificing objects and praying for
good connections. To no avail -- its purpose is malign and evil, and is the
cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in "Freela casts a tac nuke at
Shub-Internet for slowing her down." (A forged response often follows along
the lines of: "Shub-Internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily.")
Also cursed by users of the Web, {FTP} and {TELNET} when the system slows
down. The dread name of Shub-Internet is seldom spoken aloud, as it is said
that repeating it three times will cause the being to wake, deep within its
lair beneath the Pentagon. [January 1996: It develops that one of the
computer administrators in the basement of the Pentagon read this entry and
fell over laughing. As a result, you too can now poke Shub-Internet by
{ping}ing shub-internet.ims.disa.mil. see also {kremvax}. -- ESR]
