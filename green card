 :green card: n. [after the IBM System/360 Reference Data card] A summary of
an assembly language, even if the color is not green and not a card. Less
frequently used now because of the decrease in the use of assembly language.
"I'll go get my green card so I can check the addressing mode for that
instruction." The original green card became a yellow card when the
System/370 was introduced, and later a yellow booklet. An anecdote from IBM
refers to a scene that took place in a programmers' terminal room at Yorktown
in 1978. A {luser} overheard one of the programmers ask another "Do you have
a green card?" The other grunted and passed the first a thick yellow booklet.
At this point the luser turned a delicate shade of olive and rapidly left the
room, never to return. In fall 2000 it was reported from Electronic Data
Systems that the green card for 370 machines has been a blue-green booklet
since 1989.
