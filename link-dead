 :link-dead: adj. [MUD] The state a player is in when they kill their
connection to a {MUD} without leaving it properly. The player is then
commonly left as a statue in the game, and is only removed after a certain
period of time (an hour on most MUDs). Used on {IRC} as well, although it is
inappropriate in that context. Compare {netdead}.
