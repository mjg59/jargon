 :precedence lossage: /pre's*-dens los'*j/ n. [C programmers] Coding error in
an expression due to unexpected grouping of arithmetic or logical operators
by the compiler. Used esp. of certain common coding errors in C due to the
nonintuitively low precedence levels of `&', `|', `^', `<<', and `>>' (for
this reason, experienced C programmers deliberately forget the language's
{baroque} precedence hierarchy and parenthesize defensively). Can always be
avoided by suitable use of parentheses. {LISP} fans enjoy pointing out that
this can't happen in *their* favorite language, which eschews precedence
entirely, requiring one to use explicit parentheses everywhere. see {aliasing
bug}, {memory leak}, {memory smash}, {smash the stack}, {fandango on core},
{overrun screw}.
