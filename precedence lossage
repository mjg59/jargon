expression due to unexpected grouping of arithmetic or logical operators by
the compiler. Used esp. of certain common coding errors in C due to the
nonintuitively low precedence levels of &, | and ^. Can always be avoided by
suitable use of parentheses. see ALIASING BUG, MEMORY LEAK, SMASH THE STACK,
