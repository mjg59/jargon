 :fscking: /fus'-king/ or /eff'-seek-ing/ adj. [Usenet; common] Fucking, in
the expletive sense (it refers to the Unix filesystem-repair command fsck(8),
of which it can be said that if you have to use it at all you are having a
bad day). Originated on {scary devil monastery} and the bofh.net newsgroups,
but became much more widespread following the passage of {CDA}. Also
occasionally seen in the variant "What the fsck?"
