 :droid: [from `android', SF terminology for a humanoid robot of essentially
biological (as opposed to mechanical/electronic) construction] n. A person
(esp. a low-level bureaucrat or service-business employee) exhibiting most of
the following characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of the parent
organization or `the system'; (b) a blind-faith propensity to believe obvious
nonsense emitted by authority figures (or computers!); (c) a rule-governed
mentality, one unwilling or unable to look beyond the `letter of the law' in
exceptional situations; (d) a paralyzing fear of official reprimand or worse
if Procedures are not followed No Matter What; and (e) no interest in doing
anything above or beyond the call of a very narrowly-interpreted duty, or in
particular in fixing that which is broken; an "It's not my job, man"
attitude. Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and
bank clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees.
The implication is that the rules and official procedures constitute software
that the droid is executing; problems arise when the software has not been
properly debugged. The term `droid mentality' is also used to describe the
mindset behind this behavior. Compare {suit}, {marketroid}; see {-oid}.
