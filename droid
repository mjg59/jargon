 :droid: n. A person (esp. a low-level bureaucrat or service-business
employee) exhibiting most of the following characteristics: (a) na"ive trust
in the wisdom of the parent organization or `the system'; (b) a propensity to
believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures (or computers!); blind
faith; (c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or unable to look beyond
the `letter of the law' in exceptional situations; and (d) no interest in
fixing that which is broken; an "It's not my job, man" attitude. Typical
droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and bank clerk; the
syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees. The implication
is that the rules and official procedures constitute software that the droid
is executing. This becomes a problem when the software has not been properly
debugged. The term `droid mentality' is also used to describe the mindset
behind this behavior. Compare {suit}, {marketroid}; see {-oid}.
