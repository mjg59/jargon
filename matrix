 :Matrix: n. [FidoNet] 1. What the Opus BBS software and sysops call
{FidoNet}. 2. Fanciful term for a {cyberspace} expected to emerge from
current networking experiments (see {the network}). The name of the rather
good 1999 {cypherpunk} movie The Matrix played on this sense, which however
had been established for years before. 3. The totality of present-day
computer networks (popularized in this sense by John Quarterman; rare outside
academic literature).
