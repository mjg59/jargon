 OBSCURE (ob'skyoor) adj. Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning, to
imply a total lack of comprehensibility. "The reason for that last crash is
obscure." "FIND's command syntax is obscure." MODERATELY OBSCURE implies that
it could be figured out but probably isn't worth the trouble. OBSCURE IN THE
EXTREME is a preferred emphatic form.
