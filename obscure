 :obscure: adj. Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning, to imply total
incomprehensibility. "The reason for that last crash is obscure." "The
`find(1)' command's syntax is obscure!" The phrase `moderately obscure'
implies that something could be figured out but probably isn't worth the
trouble. The construction `obscure in the extreme' is the preferred emphatic
form.
