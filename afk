 :AFK: [MUD] Abbrev. for "Away From Keyboard". Used to notify others that you
will be momentarily unavailable online. eg. "Let's not go kill that frost
giant yet, I need to go AFK to make a phone call". Often MUDs will have a
command to politely inform others of your absence when they try to talk with
you. The term is not restricted to MUDs, however, and has become common in
many chat situations, from IRC to Unix talk.
