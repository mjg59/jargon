 :break-even point: n. in the process of implementing a new computer
language, the point at which the language is sufficiently effective that one
can implement the language in itself. That is, for a new language called,
hypothetically, FOOGOL, one has reached break-even when one can write a
demonstration compiler for FOOGOL in FOOGOL, discard the original
implementation language, and thereafter use older versions of FOOGOL to
develop newer ones. This is an important milestone; see {MFTL}. [Since this
was first written, several correspondents have reported that there actually
was a compiler for a tiny Algol-like language called Foogol floating around
on various {vaxen} in the early and mid-1980s. The above example may not,
after all, be hypothetical. -- ESR]
