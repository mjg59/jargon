 :fuck me harder: excl. Sometimes uttered in response to egregious
misbehavior, esp. in software, and esp. of misbehaviors which seem unfairly
persistent (as though designed in by the imp of the perverse). Often
theatrically elaborated: "Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver and 16 feet of
curare-tipped wrought-iron fence *and no lubricants*!" The phrase is
sometimes heard abbreviated `FMH' in polite company. [This entry is an
extreme example of the hackish habit of coining elaborate and evocative terms
for lossage. Here we see a quite self-conscious parody of mainstream
expletives that has become a running gag in part of the hacker culture; it
illustrates the hackish tendency to turn any situation, even one of extreme
frustration, into an intellectual game (the point being, in this case, to
creatively produce a long-winded description of the most anatomically absurd
mental image possible --- the short forms implicitly allude to all the
ridiculous long forms ever spoken). Scatological language is actually
relatively uncommon among hackers, and there was some controversy over
whether this entry ought to be included at all. As it reflects a live usage
recognizably peculiar to the hacker culture, we feel it is in the hackish
spirit of truthfulness and opposition to all forms of censorship to record it
here. --- ESR & GLS]
