 :baud barf: /bawd barf/ /n./ The garbage one gets on the monitor when using
a modem connection with some protocol setting (esp. line speed) incorrect, or
when someone picks up a voice extension on the same line, or when really bad
line noise disrupts the connection. Baud barf is not completely {random}, by
the way; hackers with a lot of serial-line experience can usually tell
whether the device at the other end is expecting a higher or lower speed than
the terminal is set to. *Really* experienced ones can identify particular
speeds.
