 :baud barf: /bawd barf/ n. The garbage one gets on a terminal (or terminal
emulator) when using a modem connection with some protocol setting (esp. line
speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice extension on the same
line, or when really bad line noise disrupts the connection. Baud barf is not
completely {random}, by the way; hackers with a lot of serial-line experience
can usually tell whether the device at the other end is expecting a higher or
lower speed than the terminal is set to. _Really_ experienced ones can
identify particular speeds.
