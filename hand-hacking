custom hand-optimized assembler, as opposed to trying to coerce the compiler
into generating better code. Both the term and the practice are becoming
uncommon. see TUNE, BUM. 2. More generally, manual construction or patching
of data sets that would normally be ground out by a translation utility and
interpreted by another program, and aren't really designed to be read or
modified by humans.
