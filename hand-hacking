 :hand-hacking: n. 1. [rare] The practice of translating {hot spot}s from an
{HLL} into hand-tuned assembler, as opposed to trying to coerce the compiler
into generating better code. Both the term and the practice are becoming
uncommon. see {tune}, {bum}, {by hand}; syn. with v. {cruft}. 2. [common]
More generally, manual construction or patching of data sets that would
normally be generated by a translation utility and interpreted by another
program, and aren't really designed to be read or modified by humans.
