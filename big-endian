 :big-endian: adj. [From Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" via the famous paper
"On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace" by Danny Cohen, USC/ISI IEN 137, dated
April 1, 1980] 1. Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given
multi-byte numeric representation, the most significant byte has the lowest
address (the word is stored `big-end-first'). Most processors, including the
IBM 370 family, the {PDP-10}, the Motorola microprocessor families, and most
of the various RISC designs current in mid-1993, are big-endian. see
{little-endian}, {middle-endian}, {NUXI problem}, {swab}. 2. An {{Internet
address}} the wrong way round. Most of the world follows the Internet
standard and writes email addresses starting with the name of the computer
and ending up with the name of the country. In the U.K. the Joint Networking
Team had decided to do it the other way round before the Internet domain
standard was established; e.g., me@uk.ac.wigan.cs. Most gateway sites have
{ad-hockery} in their mailers to handle this, but can still be confused. In
particular, the address above could be in the U.K. (domain uk) or the domain
cs (formerly, Czechoslovakia).
