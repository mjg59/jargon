 CYBERSPACE (sie'ber-spays) n. Notional "information-space" loaded with
visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called "cyberspace
decks"; a characteristic prop of CYBERPUNK SF. At time of writing (1990)
serious efforts to construct VIRTUAL REALITY interfaces modelled explicitly
on CYBERSPACE are already under way, using more conventional devices such as
glove sensors and binocular TV headsets. Few hackers are prepared to outright
deny the possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out of THE NETWORK. = D
