 :cyberspace: /si:'ber-spays/ n. 1. Notional `information-space' loaded with
visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called `cyberspace
decks'; a characteristic prop of {cyberpunk} SF. At the time of this writing
(mid-1991), serious efforts to construct {virtual reality} interfaces modeled
explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way, using more
conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets. Few
hackers are prepared to deny outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday
evolving out of the network (see {network, the}). 2. Occasionally, the
metaphoric location of the mind of a person in {hack mode}. Some hackers
report experiencing strong eidetic imagery when in hack mode; interestingly,
independent reports from multiple sources suggest that there are common
features to the experience. In particular, the dominant colors of this
subjective `cyberspace' are often gray and silver, and the imagery often
involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of
lines and angles, or moire patterns.
