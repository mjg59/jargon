 :cyberspace: /si:'ber-spays`/ /n./ 1. Notional `information-space' loaded
with visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called
`cyberspace decks'; a characteristic prop of {cyberpunk} SF. Serious efforts
to construct {virtual reality} interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian
cyberspace are under way, using more conventional devices such as glove
sensors and binocular TV headsets. Few hackers are prepared to deny outright
the possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out of the network (see
{network, the}). 2. The Internet or {Matrix} (sense #2) as a whole,
considered as a crude cyberspace (sense 1). Although this usage became widely
popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the Internet exploded into
public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among hackers because the
Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired standards they have for true
cyberspace technology. Thus, this use of the term usually tags a {wannabee}
or outsider. 3. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person
in {hack mode}. Some hackers report experiencing strong eidetic imagery when
in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from multiple sources
suggest that there are common features to the experience. In particular, the
dominant colors of this subjective `cyberspace' are often gray and silver,
and the imagery often involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate
shifting patterns of lines and angles, or moire patterns.
