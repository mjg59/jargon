 :crunch: 1. /vi./ To process, usually in a time-consuming or complicated
way. Connotes an essentially trivial operation that is nonetheless painful to
perform. The pain may be due to the triviality's being embedded in a loop
from 1 to 1,000,000,000. "FORTRAN programs do mostly {number-crunching}." 2.
/vt./ To reduce the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit
configurations completely unrelated to the original data, such as by a
Huffman code. (The file ends up looking something like a paper document would
if somebody crunched the paper into a wad.) Since such compression usually
takes more computations than simpler methods such as run-length encoding, the
term is doubly appropriate. (This meaning is usually used in the construction
`file crunch(ing)' to distinguish it from {number-crunching}.) see
{compress}. 3. /n./ The character `#'. Used at XEROX and CMU, among other
places. see {{ASCII}}. 4. /vt./ To squeeze program source into a minimum-size
representation that will still compile or execute. The term came into being
specifically for a famous program on the BBC micro that crunched BASIC source
in order to make it run more quickly (it was a wholly interpretive BASIC, so
the number of characters mattered). {Obfuscated C Contest} entries are often
crunched; see the first example under that entry.
