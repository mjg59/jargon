 CRUNCH v. 1. To process, usually in a time-consuming or complicated way.
Connotes an essentially trivial operation which is nonetheless painful to
perform. The pain may be due to the triviality being imbedded in a loop from
1 to 1000000000. "FORTRAN programs do mostly number crunching." 2. To reduce
the size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit configurations
completely unrelated to the original data, such as by a Huffman code. (The
file ends up looking like a paper document would if somebody crunched the
paper into a wad.) Since such compression usually takes more computations
than simpler methods such as counting repeated characters (such as spaces)
the term is doubly appropriate. (This meaning is usually used in the
construction "file crunch(ing)" to distinguish it from "number crunch(ing)".)
