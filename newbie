 NEWBIE /n./ [orig. fr. British military & public-school slang] A USENET
neophyte. This term originated in the NEWSGROUP "talk.bizarre" but is now in
wide use. Criteria for being considered a newbie vary wildly; a person can be
called a newbie in one newsgroup while remaining a respected participant in
another. The label "newbie" is sometimes applied as a serious insult, to a
person who has been around USENET for a long time, but who carefully hides
all evidence of having a clue. see BIFF.
