 :newbie: /n[y]oo'bee/ n. [orig. from British public-school and military
slang variant of `new boy'] A USENET neophyte. This term surfaced in the
{newsgroup} talk.bizarre but is now in wide use. Criteria for being
considered a newbie vary wildly; a person can be called a newbie in one
newsgroup while remaining a respected regular in another. The label `newbie'
is sometimes applied as a serious insult to a person who has been around
USENET for a long time but who carefully hides all evidence of having a clue.
