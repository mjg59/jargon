 :newbie: /n[y]oo'bee/ n. [very common; orig. from British public-school and
military slang variant of `new boy'] A Usenet neophyte. This term surfaced in
the {newsgroup} talk.bizarre but is now in wide use (the combination
"clueless newbie" is especially common). Criteria for being considered a
newbie vary wildly; a person can be called a newbie in one newsgroup while
remaining a respected regular in another. The label `newbie' is sometimes
applied as a serious insult to a person who has been around Usenet for a long
time but who carefully hides all evidence of having a clue. see {B1FF}; see
also {gnubie}. Compare {chainik}, {luser}.
