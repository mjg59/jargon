 :minifloppies: n.,obs. 5.25-inch floppy disks, as opposed to 3.5-inch or
{microfloppies} and the long-obsolescent 8-inch variety (if there is ever a
smaller size, they will undoubtedly be tagged `nanofloppies'). At one time,
this term was a trademark of Shugart Associates for their SA-400 minifloppy
drive. Nobody paid any attention. see {stiffy}.
