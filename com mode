 COM MODE (variant: COMM MODE) [from the ITS feature for linking two or more
terminals together so that text typed on any is echoed on all, providing a
means of conversation among hackers] n. The state a terminal is in when
linked to another in this way. Com mode has a special set of jargon words,
used to save typing, which are not used orally: BCNU Be seeing you. BTW By
the way... BYE? Are you ready to unlink? (This is the standard way to end a
com mode conversation; the other person types BYE to confirm, or else
continues the conversation.) CUL see you later. FOO? A greeting, also meaning
R U THERE? Often used in the case of unexpected links, meaning also "Sorry if
I butted in" (linker) or "What's up?" (linkee). FYI For your information...
GA Go ahead (used when two people have tried to type simultaneously; this
cedes the right to type to the other). HELLOP A greeting, also meaning R U
THERE? (An instance of the "-P" convention.) MtFBWY May the Force be with
you. (From Star Wars.) NIL No (see the main entry for NIL). OBTW Oh, by the
way... R U THERE? Are you there? SEC Wait a second (sometimes written
SEC...). T Yes (see the main entry for T). TNX Thanks. TNX 1.0E6 Thanks a
million (humorous). <double CRLF> When the typing party has finished, he
types two CRLF's to signal that he is done; this leaves a blank line between
individual "speeches" in the conversation, making it easier to re-read the
preceding text. <name>: When three or more terminals are linked, each speech
is preceded by the typist's login name and a colon (or a hyphen) to indicate
who is typing. The login name often is shortened to a unique prefix (possibly
a single letter) during a very long conversation. /\/\/\ The equivalent of a
giggle. At Stanford, where the link feature is implemented by "talk loops",
the term TALK MODE is used in place of COM MODE. Most of the above
"sub-jargon" is used at both Stanford and MIT.
