 :hacked off: [analogous to `pissed off'] adj. Said of system administrators
who have become annoyed, upset, or touchy owing to suspicions that their
sites have been or are going to be victimized by crackers, or used for
inappropriate, technically illegal, or even overtly criminal activities. For
example, having unreadable files in your home directory called `worm',
`lockpick', or `goroot' would probably be an effective (as well as
impressively obvious and stupid) way to get your sysadmin hacked off at you.
