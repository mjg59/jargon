 :register dancing: n. Many older processor architectures suffer from a
serious shortage of general-purpose registers. This is especially a problem
for compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store
temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation.
Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of
special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing
suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side-effects on the state of the
processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold an
intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the previous value
of the register is saved and then restored just before the official function
(and value) of the special-purpose register is again needed.
