 :Nominal Semidestructor: /n./ Soundalike slang for `National Semiconductor',
found among other places in the Networking/2 networking sources. During the
late 1970s to mid-1980s this company marketed a series of microprocessors
including the NS16000 and NS32000 and several variants. At one point early in
the great microprocessor race, the specs on these chips made them look like
serious competition for the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0 series.
Unfortunately, the actual parts were notoriously flaky and never implemented
the full instruction set promised in their literature, apparently because the
company couldn't get any of the mask steppings to work as designed. They
eventually sank without trace, joining the Zilog Z8000 and a few even more
obscure also-rans in the graveyard of forgotten microprocessors. Compare
