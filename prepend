 :prepend: /pree`pend'/ vt. [by analogy with `append'] To prefix. As with
`append' (but not `prefix' or `suffix' as a verb), the direct object is
always the thing being added and not the original word (or character string,
or whatever). "If you prepend a semicolon to the line, the translation
routine will pass it through unaltered."
