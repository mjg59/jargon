 :Helen Keller mode: /n./ 1. State of a hardware or software system that is
deaf, dumb, and blind, i.e., accepting no input and generating no output,
usually due to an infinite loop or some other excursion into {deep space}.
(Unfair to the real Helen Keller, whose success at learning speech was
triumphant.) see also {go flatline}, {catatonic}. 2. On IBM PCs under DOS,
refers to a specific failure mode in which a screen saver has kicked in over
an {ill-behaved} application which bypasses the very interrupts the screen
saver watches for activity. Your choices are to try to get from the program's
current state through a successful save-and-exit without being able to see
what you're doing, or to re-boot the machine. This isn't (strictly speaking)
a crash.
