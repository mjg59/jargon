 HELEN KELLER MODE n. State of a hardware or software system which is deaf,
dumb, and blind, i.e. accepting no input and generating no output, usually
due to an infinite loop or some other excursion into DEEP SPACE. (Unfair to
the real Helen Keller, whose success at learning speech was triumphant.) see
also GO FLATLINE.
