 FRIED adj. 1. Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out. Especially
used of hardware brought doen by a power glitch, short, or other electrical
event. (Sometimes this literally happens to electronic circuits! In
particular, resistors can burn out and transformers can melt down, emitting
terribly-smelling smoke. However, this term is also used metaphorically.) 2.
Of people, exhausted. Said particularly of those who continue to work in such
a state. Often used as an explanation or excuse. "Yeah, I know that fix
destroyed the file system, but I was fried when I put it in."
