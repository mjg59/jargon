 :fried: adj. 1. Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out. Especially
used of hardware brought down by a `power glitch' (see {glitch}),
{drop-outs}, a short, or some other electrical event. (Sometimes this
literally happens to electronic circuits! In particular, resistors can burn
out and transformers can melt down, emitting noxious smoke -- see {friode},
{SED} and {LER}. However, this term is also used metaphorically.) Compare
{frotzed}. 2. Of people, exhausted. Said particularly of those who continue
to work in such a state. Often used as an explanation or excuse. "Yeah, I
know that fix destroyed the file system, but I was fried when I put it in."
Esp. common in conjunction with `brain': "My brain is fried today, I'm very
short on sleep."
