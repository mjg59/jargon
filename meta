 :meta: /me´t@/, /may´t@/, /mee´t@/, pref. [from analytic philosophy] One
level of description up. A metasyntactic variable is a variable in notation
used to describe syntax, and meta-language is language used to describe
language. This is difficult to explain briefly, but much hacker humor turns
on deliberate confusion between meta-levels. see {hacker humor}.
