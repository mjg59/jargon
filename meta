 META /meta@/ or /mayt'@/ [from analytic philosophy] adj. One level of
description up. Thus, a meta-syntactic variable is a variable in notation
used to describe syntax and meta-language is language used to describe
language. This is difficult to explain out of context, but much hacker humor
turns on deliberate confusion between meta-levels. see HUMOR, HACKER.
