 :meta: /me't*/ or /may't*/ or (Commonwealth) /mee't*/ adj.,pref. [from
analytic philosophy] One level of description up. A metasyntactic variable is
a variable in notation used to describe syntax, and meta-language is language
used to describe language. This is difficult to explain briefly, but much
hacker humor turns on deliberate confusion between meta-levels. see {{Humor,
Hacker}}.
