 :XEROX PARC: The famed Palo Alto Research Center. For more than a decade,
from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume
of groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice,
windows, and icons style of software interface was invented there. So was the
laser printer, and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D machines
anticipated the poweful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade. Sadly,
these prophets were without honor in their own company; so much so that it
became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place characterized by
developing brilliant ideas for everyone else.
