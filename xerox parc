Research Center, site of much pioneering research in user interface design
and networking Yale Yale University Some other etymology abbreviations such
as {Unix} and {PDP-10} refer to technical cultures surrounding specific
operating systems, processors, or other environments. The fact that a term is
labelled with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its
use is confined to that culture. In particular, many terms labelled `MIT' and
`Stanford' are in quite general use. We have tried to give some indication of
the distribution of speakers in the usage notes; however, a number of factors
mentioned in the introduction conspire to make these indications less
definite than might be desirable. A few new definitions attached to entries
are marked [proposed]. These are usually generalizations suggested by editors
or Usenet respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries. These are _not_ represented as established jargon.
