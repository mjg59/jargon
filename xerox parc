 :XEROX PARC: /zee'roks park'/ The famed Palo Alto Research Center. For more
than a decade, from the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an
astonishing volume of groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The
modern mice, windows, and icons style of software interface was invented
there. So was the laser printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series
of D machines anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a
decade. Sadly, the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own company,
so much so that it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place that
specialized in developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. The stunning
shortsightedness and obtusity of XEROX's top-level {suit}s has been well
anatomized in "Fumbling The Future: How XEROX Invented, Then Ignored, the
First Personal Computer" by Douglas K. Smith and Robert C. Alexander (William
Morrow & Co., 1988, ISBN 0-688-09511-9).
