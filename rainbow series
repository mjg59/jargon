 :rainbow series: n. Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished
by cover color. The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals
(see {Orange Book}, {crayola books}); the term has also been commonly applied
to the PostScript reference set (see {Red Book}, {Green Book}, {Blue Book},
{White Book}). Which books are meant by "`the' rainbow series" unqualified is
thus dependent on one's local technical culture.
