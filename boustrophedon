 :boustrophedon: [from a Greek word for turning like an ox while plowing] n.
An ancient method of writing using alternate left-to-right and right-to-left
lines. This term is actually philologists' techspeak and typesetter's jargon.
Erudite hackers use it for an optimization performed by some computer
typesetting software (notably UNIX `troff(1)'). The adverbial form
`boustrophedonically' is also found (hackers purely love constructions like
this).
