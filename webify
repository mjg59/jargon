 :webify: n. To put a piece of (possibly already existing) material on the
WWW. Frequently used for papers ("Why don't you webify all your
publications?") or for demos ("They webified their 6.866 final project").
This term seems to have been (rather logically) independently invented
multiple times in the early 1990s.
