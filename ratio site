 :ratio site: [warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files where one must
first upload something before being able to download. There is a ratio, based
on bytes or files count, between the uploads and download. For instance, on a
2:1 site, to download a 4 Mb file, one must first upload at least 2 Mb of
files. The hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the ratio is.
More often than not, the server refuses uploads because its disk is full,
making it useless for downloading - or the connection magically breaks after
one has uploaded a large amount of files, just before the downloading phase
begins. see also {banner site}, {leech mode}.
