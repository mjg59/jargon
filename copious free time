 :copious free time: /n./ [Apple; orig. fr. the intro to Tom Lehrer's song
"It Makes A Fellow Proud To Be A Soldier"] 1. [used ironically to indicate
the speaker's lack of the quantity in question] A mythical schedule slot for
accomplishing tasks held to be unlikely or impossible. Sometimes used to
indicate that the speaker is interested in accomplishing the task, but
believes that the opportunity will not arise. "I'll implement the automatic
layout stuff in my copious free time." 2. [Archly] Time reserved for bogus or
otherwise idiotic tasks, such as implementation of {chrome}, or the stroking
of {suit}s. "I'll get back to him on that feature in my copious free time."
