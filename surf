 :surf: v. [from the `surf' idiom for rapidly flipping TV channels] To
traverse the Internet in search of interesting stuff, used esp. if one is
doing so with a World Wide Web browser. It is also common to speak of surfing
in to a particular resource. Hackers adopted this term early, but many have
stopped using it since it went completely mainstream around 1995. The
passive, couch-potato connotations that go with TV channel surfing were never
pleasant, and hearing non-hackers wax enthusiastic about "surfing the net"
tends to make hackers feel a bit as though their home is being overrun by
ignorami.
