 :drunk mouse syndrome: (also `mouse on drugs') n. A malady exhibited by the
mouse pointing device of some computers. The typical symptom is for the mouse
cursor on the screen to move in random directions and not in sync with the
motion of the actual mouse. Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse
and plugging it back again. Another recommended fix for optical mice is to
rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees. At Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people
kept a can of copier cleaner (isopropyl alcohol) at their desks. When the
steel ball on the mouse had picked up enough {cruft} to be unreliable, the
mouse was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while. However, this
operation left a fine residue that accelerated the accumulation of cruft, so
the dousings became more and more frequent. Finally, the mouse was declared
`alcoholic' and sent to the clinic to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic bath.
