 :hardcoded: adj. 1. Said of data inserted directly into a program, where it
cannot be easily modified, as opposed to data in some {profile}, resource
(see {de-rezz} sense 2), or environment variable that a {user} or hacker can
easily modify. 2. In C, this is esp. applied to use of a literal instead of a
`#define' macro (see {magic number}).
