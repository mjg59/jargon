 :netburp: n. [IRC] When {netlag} gets really bad, and delays between servers
exceed a certain threshold, the {IRC} network effectively becomes partitioned
for a period of time, and large numbers of people seem to be signing off at
the same time and then signing back on again when things get better. An
instance of this is called a netburp (or, sometimes, {netsplit}).
