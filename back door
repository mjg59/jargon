 BACK DOOR n. A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place
by designers or maintainers. The motivation for this is not always sinister;
some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged
accounts intended for use by field service or the vendor's maintenance
programmers. Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer
than anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known. The
famous RTM worm of late 1988, for example, used a back door in the BSD UNIX
sendmail(1) utility. see also IRON BOX, CRACKER, WORM, LOGIC BOMB.
