 :clocks: n. Processor logic cycles, so called because each generally
corresponds to one clock pulse in the processor's timing. The relative
execution times of instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks
rather than absolute fractions of a second; one good reason for this is that
clock speeds for various models of the machine may increase as technology
improves, and it is usually the relative times one is interested in when
discussing the instruction set. Compare {cycle}, {jiffy}.
