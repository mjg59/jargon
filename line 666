 :line 666: [from Christian eschatological myth] n. The notional line of
source at which a program fails for obscure reasons, implying either that
*somebody* is out to get it (when you are the programmer), or that it richly
deserves to be so gotten (when you are not). "It works when I trace through
it, but seems to crash on line 666 when I run it." "What happens is that
whenever a large batch comes through, mmdf dies on the Line of the Beast.
Probably some twit hardcoded a buffer size."
