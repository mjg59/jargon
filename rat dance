 :rat dance: /n./ [From the "Dilbert" comic strip of November 14, 1995] A
{hacking run} that produces results which, while superficially coherent, have
little or nothing to do with its original objectives. There are strong
connotations that the coding process and the objectives themselves were
pretty {random}. (In the original comic strip, the Ratbert character is
invited to dance of Dilbert's keyboard in order to produce bugs for him to
fix, and authors a Web browser instead.) This term seems to have become
widely recognized quite rapidly after the original strip, a fact which
testifies to Dilbert's huge popularity among hackers. All too many find the
perverse incentives and Kafkaesque atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical workplace
reflective of their own experiences.
