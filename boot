 BONDAGE-AND-DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE A language such as Pascal, APL, or Prolog
that, though ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an
author's theory of "right programming" even though said theory is
demonstrably inadequate for systems or even vanilla general-purpose
programming. see LANGUAGES OF CHOICE. BOOT [from "by one's bootstraps"]
vi.,n. To load and initialize the operating system on a machine. This usage
is no longer slang (having become jargon in the strict sense), but it is
sometimes used of human thought processes, as in the following exchange:
"You've lost me." "O.K., reboot. Here's the theory...". Also found in the
variants COLD BOOT (from power-off condition) and WARM BOOT (with the CPU and
all devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software crash).
