 OUTPUT SPY n. On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see
what is being printed on someone else's terminal. It works by "spying" on the
other guy's output, by examining the insides of the monitor system. It could
do this because the MIT system purposely had very little in the way of
"protection" that prevents one user from interfering with another. Fair is
fair, however. There was another program that would automatically notify you
if anyone starts to spy on your output. It worked in exactly the same way, by
looking at the insides of the operating system to see if anyone else was
looking at the insides that have to do with your output. This "counterspy"
program was called JEDGAR (pronounced as two syllables: /jed'gr/), in honor
of the former head of the FBI. By the way, the output spy program is called
OS. Throughout the rest of computer science, and also at IBM, OS means
"operating system", but among old-time ITS hackers it almost always meant
"output spy".
