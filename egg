 :egg: n. The binary code that is the payload for buffer overflow and format
string attacks. Typically, an egg written in assembly and designed to enable
remote access or escalate privileges from an ordinary user account to
administrator level when it hatches. Also known as shellcode. The name comes
from a particular buffer-overflow exploit that was co-written by a cracker
named eggplant. The variable name `egg' was used to store the payload. The
usage spread from people who saw and analyzed the code.
