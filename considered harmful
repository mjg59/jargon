 CONSIDERED HARMFUL (k@n-si'derd harm'fl) adj. Edsger Dijkstra's infamous
March 1968 CACM note, _Goto_Statement_Considered_Harmful_, fired the first
salvo in the "structured programming" wars. In the years since then a number
of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the form "X
considered Y" in reference to it. The "structured programming" wars
eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but use
of such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke.
