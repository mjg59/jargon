 :considered harmful: /adj./ Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the March 1968
"Communications of the ACM", "Goto Statement Considered Harmful", fired the
first salvo in the structured programming wars. Amusingly, the ACM considered
the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no
longer print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding
practice. In the ensuing decades, a large number of both serious papers and
parodies have borne titles of the form "X considered Y". The
structured-programming wars eventually blew over with the realization that
both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a persistent
minor in-joke (the `considered silly' found at various places in this lexicon
is related).
