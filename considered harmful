 :considered harmful: adj. [very common] Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the
March 1968 "Communications of the ACM", "Goto Statement Considered Harmful",
fired the first salvo in the structured programming wars (text at
`http://www.acm.org/classics'). Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting
acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print an
article taking so assertive a position against a coding practice. (Years
afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter called, inevitably,
"`Goto considered harmful' considered harmful'"'. In the ensuing decades, a
large number of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the
form "X considered Y". The structured-programming wars eventually blew over
with the realization that both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has
remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the `considered silly' found at
various places in this lexicon is related).
