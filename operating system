 OPERATING SYSTEM n. (Often abbreviated "OS") The foundation software of a
machine, of course; that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and
presents a default interface to the user between applications. The facilities
the operating system provides and its general design philosophy exert an
extremely strong influence on programming style and the technical culture
that grows up around a machine. Hacker folklore has been shaped primarily by
the UNIX, ITS, TOPS-10, TOPS-20/TWENEX, VMS, CP/M, MS/DOS, and MULTICS
operating systems (most importantly by ITS and UNIX). Each of these has its
own entry, which see.
