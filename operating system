 :operating system:: n. [techspeak] (Often abbreviated `OS') The foundation
software of a machine, of course; that which schedules tasks, allocates
storage, and presents a default interface to the user between applications.
The facilities an operating system provides and its general design philosophy
exert an extremely strong influence on programming style and on the technical
cultures that grow up around its host machines. Hacker folklore has been
shaped primarily by the {{UNIX}}, {{ITS}}, {{TOPS-10}},
{{TOPS-20}}/{{TWENEX}}, {{WAITS}}, {{CP/M}}, {{MS-DOS}}, and {{Multics}}
operating systems (most importantly by ITS and UNIX).
