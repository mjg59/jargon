 :pastie: /pay'stee/ n. An adhesive-backed label designed to be attached to a
key on a keyboard to indicate some non-standard character which can be
accessed through that key. Pasties are likely to be used in APL environments,
where almost every key is associated with a special character. A pastie on
the R key, for example, might remind the user that it is used to generate the
rho character. The term properly refers to nipple-concealing devices formerly
worn by strippers in concession to indecent-exposure laws; compare {tits on a
keyboard}.
