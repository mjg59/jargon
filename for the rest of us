 :for the rest of us: adj. [from the Mac slogan "The computer for the rest of
us"] 1. Used to describe a {spiffy} product whose affordability shames other
comparable products, or (more often) used sarcastically to describe {spiffy}
but very overpriced products. 2. Describes a program with a limited
interface, deliberately limited capabilities, non-orthogonality, inability to
compose primitives, or any other limitation designed to not `confuse' a naive
user. This places an upper bound on how far that user can go before the
program begins to get in the way of the task instead of helping accomplish
it. Used in reference to Macintosh software which doesn't provide obvious
capabilities because it is thought that the poor lusers might not be able to
handle them. Becomes `the rest of _them_' when used in third-party reference;
thus, "Yes, it is an attractive program, but it's designed for The Rest Of
Them" means a program that superficially looks neat but has no depth beyond
the surface flash. see also {WIMP environment}, {Macintrash},
{point-and-drool interface}, {user-friendly}.
