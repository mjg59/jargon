 :sharchive: /shar'ki:v/ n. [UNIX and Usenet; from /bin/sh archive] A
{flatten}ed representation of a set of one or more files, with the unique
property that it can be unflattened (the original files restored) by feeding
it through a standard UNIX shell; thus, a sharchive can be distributed to
anyone running UNIX, and no special unpacking software is required.
Sharchives are also intriguing in that they are typically created by shell
scripts; the script that produces sharchives is thus a script which produces
self-unpacking scripts, which may themselves contain scripts. (The downsides
of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue for {Trojan horse} attacks and
that, for recipients not running UNIX, no simple un-sharchiving program is
possible; sharchives can and do make use of arbitrarily-powerful shell
features.) Sharchives are also commonly referred to as `shar files' after the
name of the most common program for generating them.
