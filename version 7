 :Version 7: alt. V7 /vee' se'vn/ n. The first widely distributed version of
{Unix}, released unsupported by Bell Labs in 1978. The term is used
adjectivally to describe Unix features and programs that date from that
release, and are thus guaranteed to be present and portable in all Unix
versions (this was the standard gauge of portability before the POSIX and
IEEE 1003 standards). Note that this usage does _not_ derive from the release
being the "seventh version of {Unix}"; research {Unix} at Bell Labs has
traditionally been numbered according to the edition of the associated
documentation. Indeed, only the widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions
are widely known as V[67]; the OS that might today be known as `V10' is
instead known in full as "Tenth Edition Research Unix" or just "Tenth
Edition" for short. For this reason, "V7" is often read by cognoscenti as
"Seventh Edition". see {BSD}, {{Unix}}. Some old-timers impatient with
commercialization and kernel bloat still maintain that V7 was the Last True
Unix.
