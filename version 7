 :Version 7: alt. V7 /vee' se'vn/ n. The 1978 unsupported release of {{UNIX}}
ancestral to all current commercial versions. Before the release of the
POSIX/SVID standards, V7's features were often treated as a UNIX portability
baseline. see {BSD}, {USG UNIX}, {{UNIX}}. Some old-timers impatient with
commercialization and kernel bloat still maintain that V7 was the Last True
UNIX.
