 OBFUSCATED C CONTEST n. Annual contest run since 1984 over THE NETWORK by
Landon Curt Noll & friends. The overall winner is he who produces the most
unreadable, creative and bizarre working C program; various other prizes are
awarded at the judges' whim. Given C's terse syntax and macro-preprocessor
facilities, this gives contestants a lot of maneuvering room. The winning
programs often manage to be simultaneously a) funny, b) breathtaking works of
art, and c) Horrible Examples of how *not* to code in C. This relatively
short and sweet entry might help convey the flavor of obfuscated C:
main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]="Hello, world!\n)";(!!c)[*c]&&
(v--||--c&&execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));**c=!c)write(!!*c,*c, !!**c);}
