 :Jeff K.:The spiritual successor to {B1FF} and the archetype of {script
kiddies}. Jeff K. is a sixteen-year-old suburbanite who fancies himself a
"l33t haX0r", although his knowledge of computers seems to be limited to the
procedure for getting Quake up and running. His Web page
`http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk' features a number of hopelessly naive
articles, essays, and rants, all filled with the kind of misspellings,
{studlycaps}, and number-for-letter substitutions endemic to the script
kiddie and {warez d00dz} communities. Jeff's offerings, among other things,
include hardware advice (such as "AMD VERSIS PENTIUM" and "HOW TO OVARCLOAK
YOUR COMPUTAR"), his own Quake clan (Clan 40 OUNSCE), and his own comic strip
(Wacky Fun Computar Comic Jokes). Like B1FF, Jeff K. is (fortunately) a hoax.
Jeff K. was created by internet game journalist Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka,
whose web site Something Awful (http://www.somethingawful.com) highlights
unintentionally humorous news items and Web sites, as a parody of the kind of
teenage {luser} who infests Quake servers, chat rooms, and other places where
computer enthusiasts congregate. He is well-recognized in the PC game
community and his influence has spread to hacker {fora} like Slashdot as
well.
