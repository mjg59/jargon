 TIME T /tiem tee/ n. 1. An unspecified but usually well-understood time,
often used in conjunction with a later time T+1. "We'll meet on campus at
time T or at Louie's at time T+1." means, in the context of going out for
dinner, "If we meet at Louie's directly, we can meet there a little later
than if we meet on campus and then have to travel to Louie's." (Louie's is a
Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto that is a favorite with hackers. Had the
number 30 been used instead of "one", it would have implied that the travel
time from campus to Louie's is thirty minutes; whatever time T is (and that
hasn't been decided on yet), you can meet half an hour later at Louie's than
you could on campus and end up eating at the same time. 2. SINCE (or AT) TIME
T EQUALS MINUS INFINITY: A long time ago; for as long as anyone can remember;
at the time that some particular frob was first designed. Sometimes the word
"time" is omitted if there is no danger of confusing "T" as a time with "T"
meaning "yes".
