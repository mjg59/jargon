 RTI: /R-T-I/ interj. The mnemonic for the `return from interrupt'
instruction on many computers including the 6502 and 6800. The variant `RETI'
is found among former Z80 hackers (almost nobody programs these things in
assembler anymore). Equivalent to "Now, where was I?" or used to end a
conversational digression. see {pop}; see also {POPJ}.
