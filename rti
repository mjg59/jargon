 RTI: /ahr-tee-ie/ interj. The mnemonic for the `return from interrupt'
instruction on many computers including the 6502 and 6800. The variant `RETI'
is found among ex-Z80 hackers (almost nobody programs these things in
assembler anymore). Equivalent to "Now, where was I?" or used to end a
conversational digression. see {pop}; see also {POPJ}.
