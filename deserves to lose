 :deserves to lose: adj. Said of someone who willfully does the {Wrong
Thing}; humorously, if one uses a feature known to be {marginal}. What is
meant is that one deserves the consequences of one's {losing} actions. "Boy,
anyone who tries to use {mess-dos} deserves to {lose}!" ({{ITS}} fans used to
say the same thing of {{Unix}}; many still do.) see also {screw}, {chomp},
{bagbiter}.
