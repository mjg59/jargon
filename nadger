 :nadger: /nad'jr/ v. [UK] Of software or hardware (not people), to twiddle
some object in a hidden manner, generally so that it conforms better to some
format. For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit processors often take
the string text from the instruction stream, thus a print call looks like
`jsr print:"Hello world"'. The print routine has to `nadger' the saved
instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to execute the text as
instructions when the subroutine returns.
