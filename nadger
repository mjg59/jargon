 :nadger: /nad'jr/ [Great Britain] v. Of software or hardware (not people),
to twiddle some object in a hidden manner, generally so that it conforms
better to some format. For instance, string printing routines on 8-bit
processors often take the string text from the instruction stream, thus a
print call looks like `jsr print:"Hello world"'. The print routine has to
`nadger' the return instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to
execute the text as instructions.
