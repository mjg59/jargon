 VAX /vaks/ n. 1. [from Virtual Address eXtension] The most successful
minicomputer design in industry history, possibly excepting its immediate
ancestor the PDP-11. Between its release in 1978 and eclipse by KILLER MICROS
after about 1986 the VAX was probably the favorite hacker machine of them
all, esp. after the 1982 release of 4.2BSD UNIX (see BSD UNIX). Esp. noted
for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set, an asset which
became a liability after the RISC revolution following about 1985. 2. A major
brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain. Cited here because its alleged sales
pitch, "Nothing sucks like a VAX!" became a sort of battle-cry of RISC
partisans. Ironically, the slogan was actually that of a rival brand called
Electrolux.
