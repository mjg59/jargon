 :VAX: /vaks/ /n./ 1. [from Virtual Address eXtension] The most successful
minicomputer design in industry history, possibly excepting its immediate
ancestor, the PDP-11. Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse by {killer
micro}s after about 1986, the VAX was probably the hacker's favorite machine
of them all, esp. after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD Unix (see {BSD}). Esp.
noted for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set -- an
asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution. 2. A major brand of
vacuum cleaner in Britain. Cited here because its sales pitch, "Nothing sucks
like a VAX!" became a sort of battle-cry of RISC partisans. It is even
sometimes claimed that DEC actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the
vacuum-Vax people that allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in
return for not challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S. This
slogan was originally that of a rival brand called Electrolux (as in "Nothing
sucks like..."). In 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB confirmed that
the company had used this slogan in the late 1960s. It has apparently become
a classic example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not
knowing the local idiom. Ironically, he tells us that Electrolux's marketing
people were fully aware of the possible double entendre and intended it to
gain attention. And gain attention it did -- the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people
thought the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it. Several British
hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we have one
report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan surfaced there in TV ads
for the product in 1992.
