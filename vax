 :VAX: /vaks/ n. 1. [from Virtual Address eXtension] The most successful
minicomputer design in industry history, possibly excepting its immediate
ancestor, the PDP-11. Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse by {killer
micro}s after about 1986, the VAX was probably the hacker's favorite machine
of them all, esp. after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD UNIX (see {BSD}). Esp.
noted for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set --- an
asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution. 2. A major brand of
vacuum cleaner in Britain. Cited here because its alleged sales pitch,
"Nothing sucks like a VAX!" became a sort of battle-cry of RISC partisans. It
is sometimes claimed that this slogan was *not* actually used by the Vax
vacuum-cleaner people, but was actually that of a rival brand called
Electrolux (as in "Nothing sucks like..."); your editors have not yet been
able to verify either version of the legend. It is also claimed that DEC
actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that
allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not
challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S.
