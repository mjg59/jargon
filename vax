 2-5) were valid on the PDP-11, the original C machine, and became endemic
years before the VAX. The terms `vaxocentricity' and `all-the-world's-a-VAX
syndrome' have been used synonymously. :vdiff: /vee'dif/ v.,n. Visual diff.
The operation of finding differences between two files by {eyeball search}.
The term `optical diff' has also been reported, and is sometimes more
specifically used for the act of superimposing two nearly identical printouts
on one another and holding them up to a light to spot differences. Though
this method is poor for detecting omissions in the `rear' file, it can also
be used with printouts of graphics, a claim few if any diff programs can
make. see {diff}. :veeblefester: /vee'b*l-fes`tr/ n. [from the "Born Loser"
comix via Commodore; prob. originally from "Mad" Magazine's `Veeblefetzer'
parodies beginning in #15, 1954] Any obnoxious person engaged in the
(alleged) professions of marketing or management. Antonym of {hacker}.
Compare {suit}, {marketroid}. :velveeta: n. [Usenet: by analogy with {spam}]
Also knows as {ECP}; a message that is excessively cross-posted, as opposed
to {spam} which is too frequently posted. This term is widely recognized but
not commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse as spam. Compare
{jello}. :ventilator card: n. Syn. {lace card}. :Venus flytrap: n. [after the
insect-eating plant] see {firewall machine}. :verbage: /ver'b*j/ n. A
deliberate misspelling and mispronunciation of {verbiage} that assimilates it
to the word `garbage'. Compare {content-free}. More pejorative than
`verbiage'. :verbiage: n. When the context involves a software or hardware
system, this refers to {{documentation}}. This term borrows the connotations
of mainstream `verbiage' to suggest that the documentation is of marginal
utility and that the motives behind its production have little to do with the
ostensible subject. :Version 7: alt. V7 /vee' se'vn/ n. The first widely
distributed version of {Unix}, released unsupported by Bell Labs in 1978. The
term is used adjectivally to describe Unix features and programs that date
from that release, and are thus guaranteed to be present and portable in all
Unix versions (this was the standard gauge of portability before the POSIX
and IEEE 1003 standards). Note that this usage does _not_ derive from the
release being the "seventh version of {Unix}"; research {Unix} at Bell Labs
has traditionally been numbered according to the edition of the associated
documentation. Indeed, only the widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions
are widely known as V[67]; the OS that might today be known as `V10' is
instead known in full as "Tenth Edition Research Unix" or just "Tenth
Edition" for short. For this reason, "V7" is often read by cognoscenti as
"Seventh Edition". see {BSD}, {USG Unix}, {{Unix}}. Some old-timers impatient
with commercialization and kernel bloat still maintain that V7 was the Last
True Unix. :vgrep: /vee'grep/ v.,n. Visual grep. The operation of finding
patterns in a file optically rather than digitally (also called an `optical
grep'). see {grep}; compare {vdiff}. :vi: /V-I/, _not_ /vi:/ and _never_
/siks/ n. [from `Visual Interface'] A screen editor crufted together by Bill
Joy for an early {BSD} release. Became the de facto standard Unix editor and
a nearly undisputed hacker favorite outside of MIT until the rise of {EMACS}
after about 1984. Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will neither
take commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, and the default
setup on older versions provides no indication of which mode the editor is in
(years ago, a correspondent reported that he has often heard the editor's
name pronounced /vi:l/; there is now a vi clone named `vile'). Nevertheless
vi (and variants such as vim and elvis) is still widely used (about half the
respondents in a 1991 Usenet poll preferred it), and even EMACS fans often
resort to it as a mail editor and for small editing jobs (mainly because it
starts up faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS). see {holy wars}. :video
toaster: n. Historically, an Amiga running LightWave and fitted out with a
particular line of special video-display hardware from NewTek - long a
popular platform at special-effects and video production houses. More
generally, any computer system designed specifically for video production and
manipulation. Compare {web toaster} and see {toaster}. :videotex: n. obs. An
electronic service offering people the privilege of paying to read the
weather on their television screens instead of having somebody read it to
them for free while they brush their teeth. The idea bombed everywhere it
wasn't government-subsidized, because by the time videotex was practical the
installed base of personal computers could hook up to timesharing services
and do the things for which videotex might have been worthwhile better and
cheaper. Videotex planners badly overestimated both the appeal of getting
information from a computer and the cost of local intelligence at the user's
end. Like the {gorilla arm} effect, this has been a cautionary tale to
hackers ever since. see also {vannevar}. :virgin: adj. Unused; pristine; in a
known initial state. "Let's bring up a virgin system and see if it crashes
again." (Esp. useful after contracting a {virus} through {SEX}.) Also, by
extension, buffers and the like within a program that have not yet been used.
:virtual: adj. [via the technical term `virtual memory', prob. from the term
`virtual image' in optics] 1. Common alternative to {logical}; often used to
refer to the artificial objects (like addressable virtual memory larger than
physical memory) simulated by a computer system as a convenient way to manage
access to shared resources. 2. Simulated; performing the functions of
something that isn't really there. An imaginative child's doll may be a
virtual playmate. Oppose {real}. :virtual beer: n. Praise or thanks. Used
universally in the Linux community. Originally this term signified cash,
after a famous incident in which some some Britishers who wanted to buy Linus
a beer and sent him money to Finland to do so. :virtual Friday: n. (also
`logical Friday') The last day before an extended weekend, if that day is not
a `real' Friday. For example, the U.S. holiday Thanksgiving is always on a
Thursday. The next day is often also a holiday or taken as an extra day off,
in which case Wednesday of that week is a virtual Friday (and Thursday is a
virtual Saturday, as is Friday). There are also `virtual Mondays' that are
actually Tuesdays, after the three-day weekends associated with many national
holidays in the U.S. :virtual reality: n. 1. Computer simulations that use
3-D graphics and devices such as the Dataglove to allow the user to interact
with the simulation. see {cyberspace}. 2. A form of network interaction
incorporating aspects of role-playing games, interactive theater,
improvisational comedy, and `true confessions' magazines. In a virtual
reality forum (such as Usenet's alt.callahans newsgroup or the {MUD}
experiments on Internet), interaction between the participants is written
like a shared novel complete with scenery, `foreground characters' that may
be personae utterly unlike the people who write them, and common `background
characters' manipulable by all parties. The one iron law is that you may not
write irreversible changes to a character without the consent of the person
who `owns' it. Otherwise anything goes. see {bamf}, {cyberspace},
{teledildonics}. :virtual shredder: n. The jargonic equivalent of the {bit
bucket} at shops using IBM's VM/CMS operating system. VM/CMS officially
supports a whole bestiary of virtual card readers, virtual printers, and
other phantom devices; these are used to supply some of the same capabilities
Unix gets from pipes and I/O redirection. :virus: n. [from the obvious
analogy with biological viruses, via SF] A cracker program that searches out
other programs and `infects' them by embedding a copy of itself in them, so
that they become {Trojan horse}s. When these programs are executed, the
embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the `infection'. This
normally happens invisibly to the user. Unlike a {worm}, a virus cannot
infect other computers without assistance. It is propagated by vectors such
as humans trading programs with their friends (see {SEX}). The virus may do
nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally.
Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing
things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks
with the display (some viruses include nice {display hack}s). Many nasty
viruses, written by particularly perversely minded {cracker}s, do
irreversible damage, like nuking all the user's files. In the 1990s, viruses
have become a serious problem, especially among Wintel and Macintosh users;
the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to spread easily, even
infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by contrast, are immune to
such attacks). The production of special anti-virus software has become an
industry, and a number of exaggerated media reports have caused outbreaks of
near hysteria among users; many {luser}s tend to blame _everything_ that
doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks. Accordingly, this sense
of `virus' has passed not only into techspeak but into also popular usage
(where it is often incorrectly used to denote a {worm} or even a {Trojan
horse}). see {phage}; compare {back door}; see also {Unix conspiracy}.
:visionary: n. 1. One who hacks vision, in the sense of an Artificial
Intelligence researcher working on the problem of getting computers to `see'
things using TV cameras. (There isn't any problem in sending information from
a TV camera to a computer. The problem is, how can the computer be programmed
to make use of the camera information? see {SMOP}, {AI-complete}.) 2. [IBM]
One who reads the outside literature. At IBM, apparently, such a penchant is
viewed with awe and wonder. :VMS: /V-M-S/ n. {DEC}'s proprietary operating
system for its VAX minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that
loom largest in hacker folklore. Many Unix fans generously concede that
