 :winnitude: /win'*-t[y]ood/ /n./ The quality of winning (as opposed to
{winnage}, which is the result of winning). "Guess what? They tweaked the
microcode and now the LISP interpreter runs twice as fast as it used to."
"That's really great! Boy, what winnitude!" "Yup. I'll probably get a
half-hour's winnage on the next run of my program." Perhaps curiously, the
obvious antonym `lossitude' is rare.
