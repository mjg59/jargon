 :na"ive: adj. Untutored in the perversities of some particular program or
system; one who still tries to do things in an intuitive way, rather than the
right way (in really good designs these coincide, but most designs aren't
`really good' in the appropriate sense). This is completely unrelated to
general maturity or competence, or even competence at any other specific
program. It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of computing that the
natural opposite of this term is often claimed to be `experienced user' but
is really more like `cynical user'.
