 :bazaar: n.,adj. In 1997, after meditating on the success of {Linux} for
three years, the Jargon File's own editor ESR wrote an analytical paper on
hacker culture and development models titled The Cathedral and the Bazaar.
The main argument of the paper was that {Brooks's Law} is not the whole
story; given the right social machinery, debugging can be efficiently
parallelized across large numbers of programmers. The title metaphor caught
on (see also {cathedral}), and the style of development typical in the Linux
community is now often referred to as the bazaar mode. Its characteristics
include releasing code early and often, and actively seeking the largest
possible pool of peer reviewers. After 1998, the evident success of this way
of doing things became one of the strongest arguments for {open source}.
