 :crash and burn: vi.,n. A spectacular crash, in the mode of the conclusion
of the car-chase scene in the movie "Bullitt" and many subsequent imitators
(compare {die horribly}). Sun-3 monitors losing the flyback transformer and
lightning strikes on VAX-11/780 backplanes are notable crash and burn
generators. The construction `crash-and-burn machine' is reported for a
computer used exclusively for alpha or {beta} testing, or reproducing bugs
(i.e., not for development). The implication is that it wouldn't be such a
disaster if that machine crashed, since only the testers would be
inconvenienced.
