 2. A four-pack of anything (compare {hex}, sense 2). 3. The rectangle or box
glyph used in the APL language for various arcane purposes mostly related to
I/O. Former Ivy-Leaguers and Oxford types are said to associate it with
nostalgic memories of dear old University. :quadruple bucky: n. obs. 1. On an
MIT {space-cadet keyboard}, use of all four of the shifting keys (control,
meta, hyper, and super) while typing a character key. 2. On a Stanford or MIT
keyboard in {raw mode}, use of four shift keys while typing a fifth
character, where the four shift keys are the control and meta keys on _both_
sides of the keyboard. This was very difficult to do! One accepted technique
was to press the left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the fifth key
with your nose. Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in
practice, because when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to
some character that was easier to type. If you want to imply that a program
has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say something like: "Oh,
the command that makes it spin the tapes while whistling Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony is quadruple-bucky-cokebottle." see {double bucky}, {bucky bits},
{cokebottle}. :quantifiers:: In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric
prefixes used in the SI (Syste`me International) conventions for scientific
measurement have dual uses. With units of time or things that come in powers
of 10, such as money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by
powers of 1000 = 10^3. But when used with bytes or other things that
naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers
of 1024 = 2^(10). Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the
corresponding binary interpretations in common use: prefix decimal binary
kilo- 1000^1 1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 mega- 1000^2 1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576
giga- 1000^3 1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 tera- 1000^4 1024^4 = 2^40 =

1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 Here are the SI fractional prefixes:
_prefix decimal jargon usage_ milli- 1000^-1 (seldom used in jargon) micro-
1000^-2 small or human-scale (see {micro-}) nano- 1000^-3 even smaller (see
{nano-}) pico- 1000^-4 even smaller yet (see {pico-}) femto- 1000^-5 (not
used in jargon---yet) atto- 1000^-6 (not used in jargon---yet) zepto- 1000^-7
(not used in jargon---yet) yocto- 1000^-8 (not used in jargon---yet) The
prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in these
tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were adopted in 1990 by
the `19th Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures'. The binary peta- and
exa- loadings, though well established, are not in jargon use either -- yet.
The prefix milli-, denoting multiplication by 1/1000, has always been rare in
jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the `millihelen' --
notionally, the amount of beauty required to launch one ship). see the
entries on {micro-}, {pico-}, and {nano-} for more information on connotative
jargon use of these terms. `Femto' and `atto' (which, interestingly, derive
not from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings, though
it is easy to predict what those will be once computing technology enters the
required realms of magnitude (however, see {attoparsec}). There are, of
course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10. In the following table,
the `prefix' column is the international standard suffix for the appropriate
power of ten; the `binary' column lists jargon abbreviations and words for
the corresponding power of 2. The B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte
quantities; the words `meg' and `gig' are nouns that may (but do not always)
pluralize with `s'. prefix decimal binary pronunciation kilo- k K, KB, /kay/
mega- M M, MB, meg /meg/ giga- G G, GB, gig /gig/,/jig/ Confusingly, hackers
often use K or M as though they were suffix or numeric multipliers rather
than a prefix; thus "2K dollars", "2M of disk space". This is also true
(though less commonly) of G. Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000
is `k'; some use this strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB
is thus `kilobytes'). K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes;
thus, 64G is 64 gigabytes and `a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
`a G' as short for `a grand', that is, $1000). Whether one pronounces `gig'
with hard or soft `g' depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of
`giga-' is. Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
magnitude) -- for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or 524K
instead of 512K -- is a sure sign of the {marketroid}. One example of this:
it is common to refer to the capacity of 3.5" {microfloppies} as `1.44 MB' In
fact, this is a completely {bogus} number. The correct size is 1440 KB, that
is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes. So the `mega' in `1.44 MB' is compounded of
two `kilos', one of which is 1024 and the other of which is 1000. The correct
number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 = 1.40625. Alas, this fine
point is probably lost on the world forever. [1993 update: hacker Morgan
Burke has proposed, to general approval on Usenet, the following additional
prefixes: groucho 10^(-30) harpo 10^(-27) harpi 10^(27) grouchi 10^(30) We
observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and chico-
available for future expansion. Sadly, there is little immediate prospect
that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will be ratified.] [1999 upate:
there is an IEC proposal
(ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/pub/doc/ISO/information-units) for
binary multipliers, but no evidence that any of its proposals are in live
use.] :quantum bogodynamics: /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/ n. A theory that
characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such as politicians,
used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and {suit}s in general), bogon sinks (such
as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields. Bogon absorption,
of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and
may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however, the precise mechanics
of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood and remain to be
elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is most often invoked to explain the sharp
increase in hardware and software failures in the presence of suits; the
latter emit bogons, which the former absorb. see {bogon}, {computron},
{suit}, {psyton}. :quarter: n. Two bits. This in turn comes from the `pieces
of eight' famed in pirate movies -- Spanish silver crowns that could be
broken into eight pie-slice-shaped `bits' to make change. Early in American
history the Spanish coin was considered equal to a dollar, so each of these
`bits' was considered worth 12.5 cents. Syn. {tayste}, {crumb}, {quad}.
Usage: rare. General discussion of such terms is under {nybble}. :ques:
/kwes/ 1. n. The question mark character (`?', ASCII 0111111). 2. interj.
What? Also frequently verb-doubled as "Ques ques?" see {wall}.
:quick-and-dirty: adj. [common] Describes a {crock} put together under time
or user pressure. Used esp. when you want to convey that you think the fast
way might lead to trouble further down the road. "I can have a
quick-and-dirty fix in place tonight, but I'll have to rewrite the whole
module to solve the underlying design problem." see also {kluge}. :quine:
/kwi:n/ n. [from the name of the logician Willard van Orman Quine, via
Douglas Hofstadter] A program that generates a copy of its own source text as
its complete output. Devising the shortest possible quine in some given
programming language is a common hackish amusement. (We ignore some variants
of BASIC in which a program consisting of a single empty string literal
reproduces itself trivially.) Here is one classic quine: ((lambda (x) (list x
(list (quote quote) x))) (quote (lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote)
x))))) This one works in LISP or Scheme. It's relatively easy to write quines
in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle programs as data;
much harder (and thus more challenging!) in languages like C which do not.
Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines: char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()
{printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c"; main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);} For excruciatingly
exact quinishness, remove the interior line breaks. Here is another elegant
quine in ANSI C: #define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");} q(#define
q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");}) Some infamous {Obfuscated C Contest}
entries have been quines that reproduced in exotic ways. There is an amusing
Quine Home Page (http://www.nyx.org/~gthompso/quine.htm). :quote chapter and
verse: v. [by analogy with the mainstream phrase] To cite a relevant excerpt
from an appropriate {bible}. "I don't care if `rn' gets it wrong;
`Followup-To: poster' is explicitly permitted by {RFC}-1036. I'll quote
chapter and verse if you don't believe me." see also {legalese}, {language
lawyer}, {RTFS} (sense 2). :quotient: n. see {coefficient of X}. :quux:
/kwuhks/ n. [Mythically, from the Latin semi-deponent verb quuxo, quuxare,
quuxandum iri; noun form variously `quux' (plural `quuces', anglicized to
`quuxes') and `quuxu' (genitive plural is `quuxuum', for four u-letters out
of seven in all, using up all the `u' letters in Scrabble).] 1. Originally, a
{metasyntactic variable} like {foo} and {foobar}. Invented by Guy Steele for
precisely this purpose when he was young and naive and not yet interacting
with the real computing community. Many people invent such words; this one
seems simply to have been lucky enough to have spread a little. In an
eloquent display of poetic justice, it has returned to the originator in the
form of a nickname. 2. interj. see {foo}; however, denotes very little
disgust, and is uttered mostly for the sake of the sound of it. 3. Guy Steele
in his persona as `The Great Quux', which is somewhat infamous for light
verse and for the `Crunchly' cartoons. 4. In some circles, used as a punning
opposite of `crux'. "Ah, that's the quux of the matter!" implies that the
point is _not_ crucial (compare {tip of the ice-cube}). 5. quuxy: adj. Of or
pertaining to a quux. :qux: /kwuhks/ The fourth of the standard
{metasyntactic variable}, after {baz} and before the quu(u...)x series. see
{foo}, {bar}, {baz}, {quux}. This appears to be a recent mutation from
{quux}, and many versions (especially older versions) of the standard series
just run {foo}, {bar}, {baz}, {quux}, .... :QWERTY: /kwer'tee/ adj. [from the
keycaps at the upper left] Pertaining to a standard English-language
typewriter keyboard (sometimes called the Sholes keyboard after its
inventor), as opposed to Dvorak or non-US-ASCII layouts or a {space-cadet
keyboard} or APL keyboard. Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine
example of a {fossil}. It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down
the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to allow _faster_ typing --
under a constraint now long obsolete. In early typewriters, fast typing using
nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism. So Sholes fiddled the layout to
separate the letters of many common digraphs (he did a far from perfect job,
though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er', for example, each use two nearby keys).
Also, putting the letters of `typewriter' on one line allowed it to be typed
with particular speed and accuracy for {demo}s. The jamming problem was
essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but the
keyboard layout lives on. The QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some unhelpful
economic myths about how technical standards get and stay established; see
`http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html'. = R = ===== :rabbit job: n.
[Cambridge] A batch job that does little, if any, real work, but creates one
or more copies of itself, breeding like rabbits. Compare {wabbit}, {fork
bomb}. :rain dance: n. 1. Any ceremonial action taken to correct a hardware
problem, with the expectation that nothing will be accomplished. This
especially applies to reseating printed circuit boards, reconnecting cables,
etc. "I can't boot up the machine. We'll have to wait for Greg to do his rain
dance." 2. Any arcane sequence of actions performed with computers or
software in order to achieve some goal; the term is usually restricted to
rituals that include both an {incantation} or two and physical activity or
motion. Compare {magic}, {voodoo programming}, {black art}, {cargo cult
programming}, {wave a dead chicken}; see also {casting the runes}. :rainbow
series: n. Any of several series of technical manuals distinguished by cover
color. The original rainbow series was the NCSC security manuals (see {Orange
Book}, {crayola books}); the term has also been commonly applied to the
PostScript reference set (see {Red Book}, {Green Book}, {Blue Book}, {White
Book}). Which books are meant by "`the' rainbow series" unqualified is thus
dependent on one's local technical culture. :random: adj. 1. Unpredictable
(closest to mathematical definition); weird. "The system's been behaving
pretty randomly." 2. Assorted; undistinguished. "Who was at the conference?"
"Just a bunch of random business types." 3. (pejorative) Frivolous;
unproductive; undirected. "He's just a random loser." 4. Incoherent or
inelegant; poorly chosen; not well organized. "The program has a random set
of misfeatures." "That's a random name for that function." "Well, all the
names were chosen pretty randomly." 5. In no particular order, though
deterministic. "The I/O channels are in a pool, and when a file is opened one
is chosen randomly." 6. Arbitrary. "It generates a random name for the
scratch file." 7. Gratuitously wrong, i.e., poorly done and for no good
apparent reason. For example, a program that handles file name defaulting in
a particularly useless way, or an assembler routine that could easily have
been coded using only three registers, but redundantly uses seven for values
with non-overlapping lifetimes, so that no one else can invoke it without
first saving four extra registers. What {randomness}! 8. n. A random hacker;
used particularly of high-school students who soak up computer time and
generally get in the way. 9. n. Anyone who is not a hacker (or, sometimes,
anyone not known to the hacker speaking); the noun form of sense 2. "I went
to the talk, but the audience was full of randoms asking bogus questions".
10. n. (occasional MIT usage) One who lives at Random Hall. see also {J.
Random}, {some random X}. 11. [UK] Conversationally, a non sequitur or
something similarly out-of-the-blue. As in: "Stop being so random!" This
sense equates to `hatstand', taken from the Viz comic character "Roger
Irrelevant - He's completely Hatstand." :Random Number God:
[rec.games.roguelike.angband; often abbreviated `RNG'] The malign force which
lurks behind the random number generator in {Angband} (and by extension
elsewhere). A dark god that demands sacrifices and toys with its victims. "I
just found a really great item; I suppose the RNG is about to punish me..."
Apparently, Angband's random number generator occasionally gets locked in a
repetition, so you get something with a 3% chance happening 8 times in a row.
Improbable, but far too common to be pure chance. Compare {Shub-Internet}.
:random numbers:: n. When one wishes to specify a large but random number of
things, and the context is inappropriate for {N}, certain numbers are
preferred by hacker tradition (that is, easily recognized as placeholders).
These include the following: 17 Long described at MIT as `the least random
number'; see 23. 23 Sacred number of Eris, Goddess of Discord (along with 17
and 5). 42 The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and
Everything ("what is 6 times 9", correct in base 13). (Note that this answer
is completely fortuitous. `:-)') 69 From the sexual act. This one was favored
in MIT's ITS culture. 105 69 hex = 105 decimal, and 69 decimal = 105 octal.
666 The Number of the Beast. For further enlightenment, study the "Principia
Discordia", "{The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}", "The Joy of Sex", and
the Christian Bible (Revelation 13:18). see also {Discordianism} or consult
your pineal gland. see also {for values of}. :randomness: n. 1. An
inexplicable misfeature; gratuitous inelegance. 2. A {hack} or {crock} that
depends on a complex combination of coincidences (or, possibly, the
combination upon which the crock depends for its accidental failure to
malfunction). "This hack can output characters 40-57 by putting the character
in the four-bit accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting six bits --
the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing." "What randomness!" 3.
Of people, synonymous with `flakiness'. The connotation is that the person so
described is behaving weirdly, incompetently, or inappropriately for reasons
which are (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring into, (b) are probably as
inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c) are likely to pass with
time. "Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's just randomness. see if
he calls back." Despite the negative connotations jargon uses of this term
have, it is worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable resource,
very useful for applications in cryptography and elsewhere. Computers are so
thoroughly deterministic that they have a hard time generating high-quality
randomess, so hackers have sometimes felt the need to built special-purpose
contraptions for this purpose alone. One well-known website offers random
bits generated by radioactive decay (http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/).
Another derives random bits from images of Lava Lite lamps
(http://lavarand.sgi.com/). (Hackers invariably find the latter hilarious. If
you have to ask why, you'll never get it.) :rape: vt. 1. To {screw} someone
or something, violently; in particular, to destroy a program or information
irrecoverably. Often used in describing file-system damage. "So-and-so was
running a program that did absolute disk I/O and ended up raping the master
directory." 2. To strip a piece of hardware for parts. 3. [CMU/Pitt] To
mass-copy files from an anonymous ftp site. "Last night I raped Simtel's
dskutl directory." :rare mode: adj. [Unix] CBREAK mode
(character-by-character with interrupts enabled). Distinguished from {raw
mode} and {cooked mode}; the phrase "a sort of half-cooked (rare?) mode" is
used in the V7/BSD manuals to describe the mode. Usage: rare. :raster
blaster: n. [Cambridge] Specialized hardware for {bitblt} operations (a
{blitter}). Allegedly inspired by `Rasta Blasta', British slang for the sort
of portable stereo Americans call a `boom box' or `ghetto blaster'. :raster
burn: n. Eyestrain brought on by too many hours of looking at low-res, poorly
tuned, or glare-ridden monitors, esp. graphics monitors. see {terminal
illness}. :rasterbation: n. [portmanteau: raster + masturbation] The
gratuitous use of comuputer generated images and effects in movies and
graphic art which would have been better without them. Especially employed as
a term of abuse by Photoshop/GIMP users and graphic artists. :rat belt: n. A
cable tie, esp. the sawtoothed, self-locking plastic kind that you can remove
only by cutting (as opposed to a random twist of wire or a twist tie or one
of those humongous metal clip frobs). Small cable ties are `mouse belts'.
:rat dance: n. [From the {Dilbert} comic strip of November 14, 1995] A
{hacking run} that produces results which, while superficially coherent, have
little or nothing to do with its original objectives. There are strong
connotations that the coding process and the objectives themselves were
pretty {random}. (In the original comic strip, the Ratbert is invited to
dance on Dilbert's keyboard in order to produce bugs for him to fix, and
authors a Web browser instead.) Compare {Infinite-Monkey Theorem}. This term
seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly after the original
strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge popularity among hackers. All
too many find the perverse incentives and Kafkaesque atmosphere of Dilbert's
mythical workplace reflective of their own experiences. :ratio site: [warez
d00dz] A FTP site storing pirated files where one must first upload something
before being able to download. There is a ratio, based on bytes or files
count, between the uploads and download. For instance, on a 2:1 site, to
download a 4 Mb file, one must first upload at least 2 Mb of files. The
hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the ratio is. More often
than not, the server refuses uploads because its disk is full, making it
useless for downloading - or the connection magically breaks after one has
uploaded a large amount of files, just before the downloading phase begins.
see also {banner site}, {leech mode}. :rave: vi. [WPI] 1. To persist in
discussing a specific subject. 2. To speak authoritatively on a subject about
which one knows very little. 3. To complain to a person who is not in a
position to correct the difficulty. 4. To purposely annoy another person
verbally. 5. To evangelize. see {flame}. 6. Also used to describe a less
negative form of blather, such as friendly bullshitting. `Rave' differs
slightly from {flame} in that `rave' implies that it is the persistence or
obliviousness of the person speaking that is annoying, while {flame} implies
somewhat more strongly that the tone or content is offensive as well. :rave
on!: imp. Sarcastic invitation to continue a {rave}, often by someone who
wishes the raver would get a clue but realizes this is unlikely. :ravs:
/ravz/, also `Chinese ravs' n. [primarily MIT/Boston usage] Jiao-zi (steamed
or boiled) or Guo-tie (pan-fried). A Chinese appetizer, known variously in
the plural as dumplings, pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie),
and (around Boston) `Peking Ravioli'. The term `rav' is short for `ravioli',
and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind.
Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no
cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling (good ones include
Chinese chives), and is cooked differently, either by steaming or frying. A
rav or dumpling can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the
pan-fried kind (so called because it sticks to the frying pot and has to be
scraped off). "Let's get hot-and-sour soup and three orders of ravs." see
also {{oriental food}}. :raw mode: n. A mode that allows a program to
transfer bits directly to or from an I/O device (or, under {bogus} operating
systems that make a distinction, a disk file) without any processing,
abstraction, or interpretation by the operating system. Compare {rare mode},
{cooked mode}. This is techspeak under Unix, jargon elsewhere. :RBL: /R-B-L/
Abbreviation: "Realtime Blackhole List". A service that allows people to
blacklist sites for emitting {spam}, and makes the blacklist available in
real time to electronic-mail transport programs that know how to use RBL so
they can filter out mail from those sites. Drastic (and controversial) but
effective. There is an RBL home page (http://maps.vix.com/rbl/usage.html).
:rc file: /R-C fi:l/ n. [Unix: from `runcom files' on the {CTSS} system
1962-63, via the startup script `/etc/rc'] Script file containing startup
instructions for an application program (or an entire operating system),
usually a text file containing commands of the sort that might have been
invoked manually once the system was running but are to be executed
automatically each time the system starts up. see also {dot file}, {profile}
(sense 1). :RE: /R-E/ n. Common spoken and written shorthand for {regexp}.
:read-only user: n. Describes a {luser} who uses computers almost exclusively
for reading Usenet, bulletin boards, and/or email, rather than writing code
or purveying useful information. see {twink}, {terminal junkie}, {lurker}.
:README file: n. Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the
top-level directory of a Unix source distribution, containing a pointer to
more detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision history, notes,
etc. (The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or
readme.txt or some other variant.) In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not
usually distributed in source form, and the README is more likely to contain
user-oriented material like last-minute documentation changes, error
workarounds, and restrictions. When asked, hackers invariably relate the
README convention to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures
In Wonderland" in which Alice confronts magic munchies labeled "Eat Me" and
"Drink Me". :real: adj. Not simulated. Often used as a specific antonym to
{virtual} in any of its jargon senses. :real estate: n. May be used for any
critical resource measured in units of area. Most frequently used of `chip
real estate', the area available for logic on the surface of an integrated
circuit (see also {nanoacre}). May also be used of floor space in a {dinosaur
pen}, or even space on a crowded desktop (whether physical or electronic).
:real hack: n. A {crock}. This is sometimes used affectionately; see {hack}.
:real operating system: n. The sort the speaker is used to. People from the
BSDophilic academic community are likely to issue comments like "System V?
Why don't you use a _real_ operating system?", people from the
commercial/industrial Unix sector are known to complain "BSD? Why don't you
use a _real_ operating system?", and people from IBM object "Unix? Why don't
you use a _real_ operating system?" Only {MS-DOS} is universally considered
unreal. see {holy wars}, {religious issues}, {proprietary}, {Get a real
computer!} :Real Programmer: n. [indirectly, from the book "Real Men Don't
Eat Quiche"] A particular sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant
attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when justified by
experience. The archetypal `Real Programmer' likes to program on the {bare
metal} and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every
machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a
debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps. Real
Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been {bum}med into a state
of {tense}ness just short of rupture. Real Programmers never use comments or
write documentation: "If it was hard to write", says the Real Programmer, "it
should be hard to understand." Real Programmers can make machines do things
that were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy
unless doing so. A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish
brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls. Real Programmers live on junk
food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap
out of other programmers -- because someday, somebody else might have to try
to understand their code in order to change it. Their successors generally
consider it a {Good Thing} that there aren't many Real Programmers around any
more. For a famous (and somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real
Programmer, see "{The Story of Mel}" in Appendix A. The term itself was
popularized by a 1983 Datamation article "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal"
by Ed Post, still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form. Typing
"Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" into a web search engine should turn up a
copy. :Real Soon Now: adv. [orig. from SF's fanzine community, popularized by
Jerry Pournelle's column in "BYTE"] 1. Supposed to be available (or fixed, or
cheap, or whatever) real soon now according to somebody, but the speaker is
quite skeptical. 2. When one's gods, fates, or other time commitments permit
one to get to it (in other words, don't hold your breath). Often abbreviated
RSN. Compare {copious free time}. :real time: 1. [techspeak] adj. Describes
an application which requires a program to respond to stimuli within some
small upper limit of response time (typically milli- or microseconds).
Process control at a chemical plant is the {canonical} example. Such
applications often require special operating systems (because everything else
must take a back seat to response time) and speed-tuned hardware. 2. adv. In
jargon, refers to doing something while people are watching or waiting. "I
asked her how to find the calling procedure's program counter on the stack
and she came up with an algorithm in real time." :real user: n. 1. A
commercial user. One who is paying _real_ money for his computer usage. 2. A
non-hacker. Someone using the system for an explicit purpose (a research
project, a course, etc.) other than pure exploration. see {user}. Hackers who
are also students may also be real users. "I need this fixed so I can do a
problem set. I'm not complaining out of randomness, but as a real user." see
also {luser}. :Real World: n. 1. Those institutions at which `programming'
may be used in the same sentence as `FORTRAN', `{COBOL}', `RPG', `{IBM}',
`DBASE', etc. Places where programs do such commercially necessary but
intellectually uninspiring things as generating payroll checks and invoices.
2. The location of non-programmers and activities not related to programming.
3. A bizarre dimension in which the standard dress is shirt and tie and in
which a person's working hours are defined as 9 to 5 (see {code grinder}). 4.
Anywhere outside a university. "Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into the
Real World." Used pejoratively by those not in residence there. In
conversation, talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike
speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on the campus of
Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted lamp-post which
bears the label `REALITY CHECKPOINT'. It marks the boundary between
university and the Real World; check your notions of reality before passing.
This joke is funnier because the Cambridge `campus' is actually coextensive
with the center of Cambridge town. see also {fear and loathing}, {mundane},
and {uninteresting}. :reality check: n. 1. The simplest kind of test of
software or hardware; doing the equivalent of asking it what 2 + 2 is and
seeing if you get 4. The software equivalent of a {smoke test}. 2. The act of
letting a {real user} try out prototype software. Compare {sanity check}.
:reality-distortion field: n. An expression used to describe the persuasive
ability of managers like Steve Jobs (the term originated at Apple in the
1980s to describe his peculiar charisma). Those close to these managers
become passionately committed to possibly insane projects, without regard to
the practicality of their implementation or competitive forces in the
marketpace. :reaper: n. A {prowler} that {GFR}s files. A file removed in this
way is said to have been `reaped'. :recompile the world: The surprisingly
large amount of work that needs to be done as the result of any small but
globally visible program change. "The world" may mean the entirety of some
huge program, or may in theory refer to every program of a certain class in
the entire known universe. For instance, "Add one #define to stdio.h, and you
have to recompile the world." This means that any minor change to the
standard-I/O header file theoretically mandates recompiling every C program
in existence, even if only to verify that the change didn't screw something
else up. In practice, you may not actually have to recompile the world, but
the implication is that some human cleverness is required to figure out what
parts can be safely left out. :rectangle slinger: n. see {polygon pusher}.
:recursion: n. see {recursion}. See also {tail recursion}. :recursive
acronym:: n. A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to choose
acronyms/abbreviations that refer humorously to themselves or to other
acronyms/abbreviations. The classic examples were two MIT editors called EINE
("EINE Is Not EMACS") and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially"). More recently,
there is a Scheme compiler called LIAR (Liar Imitates Apply Recursively), and
{GNU} (q.v., sense 1) stands for "GNU's Not Unix!" -- and a company with the
name Cygnus, which expands to "Cygnus, Your GNU Support" (though Cygnus
people say this is a {backronym}). see also {mung}, {EMACS}. :Red Book: n. 1.
Informal name for one of the four standard references on {{PostScript}}
("PostScript Language Reference Manual", Adobe Systems (Addison-Wesley, 1985;
QA76.73.P67P67; ISBN 0-201-10174-2, or the 1990 second edition ISBN
0-201-18127-4); the others are known as the {Green Book}, the {Blue Book},
and the {White Book} (sense 2). 2. Informal name for one of the 3 standard
references on Smalltalk ("Smalltalk-80: The Interactive Programming
Environment" by Adele Goldberg (Addison-Wesley, 1984; QA76.8.S635G638; ISBN
0-201-11372-4); this too is associated with blue and green books). 3. Any of
the 1984 standards issued by the CCITT eighth plenary assembly. These
include, among other things, the X.400 email spec and the Group 1 through 4
fax standards. 4. The new version of the {Green Book} (sense 4) -- IEEE
1003.1-1990, a.k.a ISO 9945-1 -- is (because of the color and the fact that
it is printed on A4 paper) known in the USA as "the Ugly Red Book That Won't
Fit On The Shelf" and in Europe as "the Ugly Red Book That's A Sensible
Size". 5. The NSA "Trusted Network Interpretation" companion to the {Orange
Book}. 6. Nemeth, Snyder, seebass, Hein; "Unix System Administration
Handbook, Second Edition" (Prentice Hall PTR, New Jersey; 1995;
QA76.76.063N45; ISBN 0-13-151051-7). see also {{book titles}}. :red wire: n.
[IBM] Patch wires installed by programmers who have no business mucking with
the hardware. It is said that the only thing more dangerous than a hardware
guy with a code patch is a {softy} with a soldering iron.... Compare {blue
wire}, {yellow wire}, {purple wire}. :regexp: /reg'eksp/ n. [Unix] (alt.
`regex' or `reg-ex') 1. Common written and spoken abbreviation for `regular
expression', one of the wildcard patterns used, e.g., by Unix utilities such
as `grep(1)', `sed(1)', and `awk(1)'. These use conventions similar to but
more elaborate than those described under {glob}. For purposes of this
lexicon, it is sufficient to note that regexps also allow complemented
character sets using `^'; thus, one can specify `any non-alphabetic
character' with `[^A-Za-z]'. 2. Name of a well-known PD regexp-handling
package in portable C, written by revered Usenetter Henry Spencer
<<henry@zoo.toronto.edu>>. :register dancing: n. Many older processor
architectures suffer from a serious shortage of general-purpose registers.
This is especially a problem for compiler-writers, because their generated
code needs places to store temporaries for things like intermediate values in
expression evaluation. Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86,
do have a handful of special-purpose registers that can be pressed into
service, providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on
the state of the processor: while the special-purpose register is being used
to hold an intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the
previous value of the register is saved and then restored just before the
official function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again
needed. :rehi: [IRC, MUD] "Hello again." Very commonly used to greet people
upon returning to an IRC channel after {channel hopping}. :reincarnation,
cycle of: n. see {cycle of reincarnation}. :reinvent the wheel: v. To design
or implement a tool equivalent to an existing one or part of one, with the
implication that doing so is silly or a waste of time. This is often a valid
criticism. On the other hand, automobiles don't use wooden rollers, and some
kinds of wheel have to be reinvented many times before you get them right. On
the third hand, people reinventing the wheel do tend to come up with the
moral equivalent of a trapezoid with an offset axle. :relay rape: n. The
hijacking of a third party's unsecured mail server to deliver {spam}.
:religion of CHI: /ki:/ n. [Case Western Reserve University] Yet another
hackish parody religion (see also {Church of the SubGenius},
{Discordianism}). In the mid-70s, the canonical "Introduction to Programming"
courses at CWRU were taught in Algol, and student exercises were punched on
cards and run on a Univac 1108 system using a homebrew operating system named
CHI. The religion had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever the
worshipper noted that a digital clock read 11:08, he or she would recite the
phrase "It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN,
