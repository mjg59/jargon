 :highly: [scientific computation] adv. The preferred modifier for
overstating an understatement. As in: `highly nonoptimal', the worst possible
way to do something; `highly nontrivial', either impossible or requiring a
major research project; `highly nonlinear', completely erratic and
unpredictable; `highly nontechnical', drivel written for {luser}s,
oversimplified to the point of being misleading or incorrect (compare
{drool-proof paper}). In other computing cultures, postfixing of {in the
extreme} might be preferred.
