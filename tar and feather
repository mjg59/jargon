 :tar and feather: [from UNIX `tar(1)'] vt. To create a transportable archive
from a group of files by first sticking them together with `tar(1)' (the Tape
ARchiver) and then compressing the result (see {compress}). The latter action
is dubbed `feathering' partly for euphony and (if only for contrived effect)
by analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to decrease wind
resistance, or with an oar to reduce water resistance; smaller files, after
all, slip through comm links more easily.
