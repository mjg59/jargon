 TAR AND FEATHER [from UNIX tar(1)] v. To create a transportable archive from
a group of files by first sticking them together with the tape archiver
tar(1) and then compressing the result (see COMPRESS). The latter is dubbed
`feathering' by analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to decrease
wind resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm links more
easily.
