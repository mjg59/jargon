 :tall card: /n./ A PC/AT-size expansion card (these can be larger than IBM
PC or XT cards because the AT case is bigger). see also {short card}. When
IBM introduced the PS/2 model 30 (its last gasp at supporting the ISA) they
made the case lower and many industry-standard tall cards wouldn't fit; this
was felt to be a reincarnation of the {connector conspiracy}, done with less
style.
