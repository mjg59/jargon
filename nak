 NAK: [from the ASCII mnemonic for #b0010101] interj. 1. On-line joke answer
to {ACK}? --- "I'm not here". 2. On-line answer to a request for chat ---
"I'm not available". 3. Used to politely interrupt someone to tell them you
don't understand their point or that they have suddenly stopped making sense.
see {ACK}, sense #3. "And then, after we recode the project in COBOL...."
"Nak, Nak, Nak! I thought I heard you say COBOL!" nano-: [in measurement, the
next quantifier below {micro-}; meaning * 10 ^ -9] pref. Smaller than
{micro-}, and used in the same rather loose and connotative way. Thus, one
has {{nanotechnology}} (coined by hacker K. Eric Drexler) by analogy with
`microtechnology'; and a few machine architectures have a `nanocode' level
below `microcode'. Tom Duff at Bell Labs has also pointed out that "Pi
seconds is a nanocentury". see also {pico-}, {nanoacre}, {nanobot},
{nanocomputer}, {nanofortnight}. nanoacre: /nan'o-ay`kr/ n. An areal unit
(about 2 mm square) of real estate on a VLSI chip. The term gets its giggle
value from the fact that VLSI nanoacres have costs in the same range as real
acres once one figures in design and fabrication-setup costs. nanobot:
/nan'oh-bot/ n. A robot of microscopic proportions, presumably built by means
of {{nanotechnology}}. As yet, only used informally (and speculatively!).
Also sometimes called a `nanoagent'. nanocomputer: /nan'oh-k@m-pyoo'tr/ n. A
computer whose switching elements are molecular in size. Designs for
mechanical nanocomputers which use single-molecule sliding rods for their
logic have been proposed. The controller for a {nanobot} would be a
nanocomputer. nanofortnight: [Adelaide University] n. 1 fortnight times 10 ^
-9, or about 1.2 ms. This unit was used largely by students doing
undergraduate practicals. see {microfortnight}, {attoparsec} and {micro-}.
nanotechnology:: /nan'-oh-tek-no`l@-ji/ n. A hypothetical fabrication
technology in which objects are designed and built with the individual
specification and placement of each separate atom. The first unequivocal
nanofabrication experiments are taking place now (1990), for example with the
deposition of individual xenon atoms on a nickel substrate to spell the logo
of a certain very large computer company by two of its physicists.
Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture ever since the
term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book `Engines of Creation', where
he predicted that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers,
permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth. see
also {blue goo}, {gray goo}, {nanobot}. nastygram: n. 1. A protocol packet or
item of email (the latter is also called a `letterbomb') that takes advantage
of misfeatures or security holes on the target system to do untoward things.
2. Disapproving mail, esp. from a {net.god}, pursuant to a violation of
{netiquette}. Compare {shitogram}. 3. A status report from an unhappy, and
probably picky, customer. "What'd the Germans say in today's nastygram?" 4.
[deprecated] An error reply by mail from a {daemon}; in particular, a {bounce
message}. Nathan Hale: n. An asterisk (see also {splat}, {{ASCII}}). Oh, you
want an etymology? Notionally, from "I regret that I have only one asterisk
for my country!", a misquote of the famous remark uttered by Nathan Hale just
before he was hanged. Hale was a (failed) spy for the rebels in the American
War of Independence. nature: n. see {has the X nature}. neat hack: n. A
clever technique. Also, a brilliant practical joke, where neatness is
correlated with cleverness, harmlessness, and surprise value. Example: the
Caltech Rose Bowl card display switch (see Appendix A). see {hack}.
neep-neep: /neep neep/ [onomatopoeic, from New York SF fandom] n. One who is
fascinated by computers. More general than {hacker}, as it need not imply
more skill than is required to boot games on a PC. The derived noun
`neep-neeping' applies specifically to the long conversations about computers
that tend to develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties. Fandom has
a related proverb to the effect that "Hacking is a conversational black
hole!". neophilia: /nee`oh-fil'-ee-uh/ n. The trait of being excited and
pleased by novelty. Common trait of most hackers, SF fans, and members of
several other connected leading-edge subcultures, including the
pro-technology `Whole-Earth' wing of the ecology movement, space activists,
many members of MENSA, and the Discordian/neo-pagan underground. All these
groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share
characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, {{Music}}, and {{Oriental
Food}}. net.-: /net dot/ pref. [USENET] Prefix used to describe people and
events related to USENET. From the time before the {Great Renaming}, when all
non-local newsgroups had names beginning `net.'. Includes {net.god}s,
`net.goddesses' (various charismatic net.women with circles of on-line
admirers), `net.lurkers', (see {lurker}), `net.person', `net.parties' (a
synonym for {boink} sense #2 (q.v.)) and many similar constructs. see also
{net.police}. net.god: /net god/ n. Used to refer to anyone who satisfies
some combination of the following conditions: has been visible on USENET for
more than five years, ran one of the original backbone sites, moderated an
important newsgroup, wrote news software, or knows Gene, Mark, Rick, Mel,
Henry, Chuq, and Greg personally. see {demigod}. net.police: n. (var.
`net.cops') Those USENET readers who feel it is their responsibility to
pounce on and {flame} any posting which they regard as offensive, or in
violation of their understanding of {netiquette}. Generally used
sarcastically or pejoratively. Also spelled `net police'. see also {net.-},
{code police}. nethack: /net'hak/ n. see {hack}, sense #8. netiquette:
/net'ee-ket, net'i-ket/ [portmanteau from "network etiquette"] n. Conventions
of politeness recognized on {USENET}, such as: avoidance of cross-posting to
inappropriate groups, or refraining from commercial pluggery on the net.
netnews: n. 1. The software that makes {USENET} run. 2. The content of
USENET. "I read netnews right after my mail most mornings". netrock: [IBM] n.
A {flame}; used esp. on VNET, IBM's internal corporate network. network
address: n. (also `net address') As used by hackers, means an address on
`the' network (see {network, the}; this is almost always a {bang path} or
{{Internet address}}). Such an address is essential if one wants to be to be
taken seriously by hackers; in particular, persons or organizations that
claim to understand, work with, sell to, or recruit from among hackers but
*don't* display net addresses are quietly presumed to be clueless poseurs and
mentally flushed (see {flush}, sense #4). Hackers often put their net
addresses on their business cards and wear them prominently in contexts where
they expect to meet other hackers face-to-face (see also {{Science-Fiction
Fandom}}). This is mostly functional, but is also a connotative signal that
one identifies with hackerdom (like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed
T-shirts among Grateful Dead fans). Net addresses are often used in email
text as a more concise substitute for personal names; indeed, hackers may
come to know each other quite well by network names without ever learning
each others' `legal' monikers. see also {sitename}, {domainist}. network
meltdown: n. A state of complete network overload; the network equivalent of
{thrash}ing. This may be induced by a {Chernobyl packet}, see also {broadcast
storm}, {kamikaze packet}. network, the: n. 1. The union of all the major
noncommercial, academic, and hacker-oriented networks such as Internet, the
old ARPANET, NSFnet, BITNET, and the virtual UUCP and {USENET} `networks',
plus the corporate in-house networks and commercial time-sharing services
(such as CompuServe) that gateway to them. A site is generally considered `on
the network' if it can be reached through some combination of Internet-style
(@-sign) and UUCP (bang-path) addresses. see {bang path}, {{Internet
address}}, {network address}. 2. A fictional conspiracy of libertarian
hacker-subversives and anti-authoritarian monkeywrenchers described in Robert
Anton Wilson's novel `Schrodinger's Cat', to which many hackers have
subsequently decided they belong (this is an example of {ha ha only
serious}). In sense #1, `network' is frequently abbreviated to `net'. "Are
you on the net?" is a frequent question when hackers first meet face to face,
and "see you on the net!" is a frequent goodbye. New Jersey: [primarily
Stanford/Silicon Valley] adj. Generically, brain-damaged or of poor design.
This refers to the allegedly wretched quality of such software as C, C++, and
UNIX (which originated at Bell Labs in New Jersey). "This compiler bites the
bag, but what can you expect from a compiler designed in New Jersey?" see
also {UNIX conspiracy}. New Testament: n. [C programmers] The second edition
of K&R's `The C Programming Language' (Prentice-Hall 1988, ISBN
0-13-110362-8), describing ANSI Standard C. see {K&R}. newbie: /n[y]oo'bee/
n. [orig. from British public-school & military slang contraction of `new
boy'] A USENET neophyte. This term originated in the {newsgroup}
`talk.bizarre' but is now in wide use. Criteria for being considered a newbie
vary wildly; a person can be called a newbie in one newsgroup while remaining
a respected regular in another. The label `newbie' is sometimes applied as a
serious insult, to a person who has been around USENET for a long time but
who carefully hides all evidence of having a clue. see {BIFF}. newgrp wars:
/n[y]oo'grp wohrz/ [USENET] n. Salvos of dueling `newgrp' and `rmgroup'
messages sometimes exchanged by persons on opposite sides of a dispute over
whether a {newsgroup} should be created net-wide. These usually settle out
within a week or two as it becomes clear whether the group has a natural
constituency (usually, it doesn't). At times, especially in the completely
anarchic `alt' hierarchy, the names of newsgroups themselves become a form of
comment or humor; e.g. the spinoff of `alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork' from
`alt.tv.muppets' in early 1990, or any number of specialized abuse groups
named after particularly notorious {flamer}s, eg. `alt.weemba'. newline:
/n[y]oo'lien/ n. 1. [techspeak, primarily UNIX] The ASCII LF character
(#b0001010), used under {UNIX} as a text line terminator. A Bell-Labs-ism
rather than a Berkeleyism; interestingly (and unusually for UNIX jargon) it
is said originally to have been an IBM usage (though the term `newline'
appears in ASCII standards, it never caught on in the general computing world
before UNIX). 2. More generally, any magic character, character sequence, or
operation (like Pascal's writeln procedure) required to terminate a text
record or separate lines. see {crlf}, {terpri}. NeWS: /nee'wis/, /n[y]oo'is/
or /n[y]ooz/ [acronym; the Network Window System] n. The road not taken in
window systems, an elegant Postscript-based environment that would almost
certainly have won the standards war with {X} if it hadn't been {proprietary}
to Sun Microsystems. There is a lesson here that many software vendors
haven't yet heeded. Many hackers insist on the two-syllable pronunciations
above as a way of distinguishing NeWS from `news' (the {netnews} software).
newsfroup: /n[y]oos'froop/ [USENET] n. Silly written-only synonym for
{newsgroup}, originated as a typo but now in regular use on USENET's
talk.bizarre and other lunatic-fringe groups. newsgroup: [USENET] n. One of
{USENET}'s huge collection of topic groups. Among the best-known are
`comp.lang.c' (the C-language forum), `comp.unix.wizards',
`rec.arts.sf-lovers' (for science-fiction fans), and `talk.politics.misc'
(miscellaneous political discussions and {flamage}). nickle: [From `nickel',
common name for the US 5-cent coin] n. A {nybble} + 1; 5 bits. Reported among
developers for Mattel's GI 1600 (the Intellivision games processor), a chip
with 16-bit-wide RAM but 10-bit-wide ROM. see also {deckle}. night mode: n.
see {phase} (of people). Nightmare File System: n. Pejorative hackerism for
Sun's Network File System (NFS). In any nontrivial network of Suns where
there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down, the others
often freeze up. Some machine tries to access the down one, and (getting no
response) repeats indefinitely. This causes it to appear dead to some
messages. Then another machine tries to reach either the down machine or the
pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes pseudo-down. The first machine to
discover the down one is now trying both to access the down one and respond
to the pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach. This snowballs very
fast and soon the entire network of machines is frozen --- the user can't
even abort the file access that started the problem! (ITS partisans are apt
to cite this as proof of UNIX's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working NFS-like
shared file system with none of these problems in the early 1970s. Of course,
ITS only had 6-character filenames and no subdirectories, so it was solving a
simpler problem.) see also {broadcast storm}.
