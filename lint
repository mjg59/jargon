 :lint: [from UNIX's `lint(1)', named for the bits of fluff it picks from
programs] 1. vt. To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and
portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use of automated analysis
tools, most esp. if the UNIX utility `lint(1)' is used. This term used to be
restricted to use of `lint(1)' itself, but (judging by references on USENET)
it has become a shorthand for {desk check} at some non-UNIX shops, even in
languages other than C. Also as v. {delint}. 2. n. Excess verbiage in a
document, as in "this draft has too much lint".
