 LINT [from UNIX's lint(1), named perhaps for the bits of fluff it picks from
programs] v. To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and
portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use of automated analysis
tools, most esp. if the UNIX utility lint(1) is used. This term used to be
restricted to use of lint(1) itself but (judging by references on USENET) has
become a shorthand for `desk-check' at some non-UNIX shops, even in some
languages other than C. see also DELINT.
