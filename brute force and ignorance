 BRUTE FORCE AND IGNORANCE n. A popular design technique at many software
houses --- BRUTE FORCE coding unrelieved by any knowledge of how problems
have been previously solved in elegant ways. Dogmatic adherence to design
methodologies tends to encourage it. Characteristic of early LARVAL STAGE
programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it. Often abbreviated BFI, as
in: "Gak, they used a bubble sort! That's strictly from BFI." (this comment
might be used by a hacker to describe the example given under BRUTE FORCE
above). Compare BOGOSITY.
