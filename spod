 :spod: [Great Britain] n. A lower form of life found on {talker system}s and
{MUD}s. The spod has few friends in {RL} and uses talkers instead, finding
communication easier and preferable over the net. He has all the negative
traits of the {computer geek} without having any interest in computers per
se. Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and
considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to
sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following passed-on
instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet ("Wow! It's in America!")
and complaining when he is not allowed to use busy routes. A true spod will
start any conversation with "Are you male or female?" (and follow it up with
"Got any good numbers/IDs/passwords?") and will not talk to someone
physically present in the same terminal room until they log onto the same
machine that he is using and enter talk mode. Compare {newbie}, {tourist},
{weenie}, {twink}, {terminal junkie}.
