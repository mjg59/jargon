 EPOCH, THE [UNIX] n. The time and date corresponding to zero in an operating
system's clock and timestamp values. Under most UNIX versions, 00:00 of
January 1st 1970 GMT. System time is measured in seconds or TICKS past the
era. Syn. with EPOCH. see TICKS, WALL TIME. Note that weird problems may
ensue when the clock wraps around, and that this is actually not a rare
event; on systems counting 10 TICKS per second, a 32 bit count of ticks is
only good for 6.8 years.
