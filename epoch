 :epoch: /n./ [Unix: prob. from astronomical timekeeping] The time and date
corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and timestamp values. Under
most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS,
it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858 (base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's
ephemerides); on a Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904.
System time is measured in seconds or {tick}s past the epoch. Weird problems
may ensue when the clock wraps around (see {wrap around}), which is not
necessarily a rare event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a signed
32-bit count of ticks is good only for 6.8 years. The 1-tick-per-second clock
of Unix is good only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software
continues to consider it signed and that word lengths don't increase by then.
