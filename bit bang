 BIT BANG n. Transmission of data on a serial line accomplished by rapidly
tweaking a single output bit at the appropriate times (popular on certain
early models of PRIME computers, presumably when UARTs were too expensive;
and on archaic Z-80 micros with a Zilog PIO but no SIO). The technique is a
simple loop with eight OUT, SHIFT, OUT etc for each byte. Input is more
interesting. And full duplex (doing input and output at the same time) is one
way to separate the real hackers from the wannabees.
