 :UUOC: [from the comp.unix.shell group on Usenet] Stands for Useless Use of
{cat}; the reference is to the Unix command cat(1), not the feline animal. As
received wisdom on comp.unix.shell observes, "The purpose of cat is to
concatenate (or `catenate') files. If it's only one file, concatenating it
with nothing at all is a waste of time, and costs you a process."
Nevertheless one sees people doing cat file | some_command and its args ...
instead of the equivalent and cheaper <file some_command and its args ... or
(equivalently and more classically) some_command and its args ... <file Since
1995, occasional awards for UUOC have been given out, usually by Perl
luminary Randal L. Schwartz. There is a web page devoted to this and other
similar awards. V V7 vadding vanilla vanity domain vannevar vaporware var
