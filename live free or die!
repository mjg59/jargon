 :Live Free Or Die!: imp. 1. The state motto of New Hampshire, which appears
on that state's automobile license plates. 2. A slogan associated with Unix
in the romantic days when Unix aficionados saw themselves as a tiny,
beleaguered underground tilting against the windmills of industry. The "free"
referred specifically to freedom from the {fascist} design philosophies and
crufty misfeatures common on competing operating systems. Armando Stettner,
one of the early Unix developers, used to give out fake license plates
bearing this motto under a large Unix, all in New Hampshire colors of green
and white. These are now valued collector's items. In 1994 {DEC} put an
inferior imitation of these in circulation with a red corporate logo added.
Compaq (half of which was once DEC) has continued the practice.
