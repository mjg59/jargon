 :Live Free Or Die!: imp. 1. The state motto of New Hampshire, which appears
on that state's automobile license plates. 2. A slogan associated with UNIX
in the romantic days when UNIX aficionados saw themselves as a tiny,
beleaguered underground tilting against the windmills of industry. The "free"
referred specifically to freedom from the {fascist} design philosophies and
crufty misfeatures common on commercial operating systems. Armando Stettner,
one of the early UNIX developers, used to give out fake license plates
bearing this motto under a large UNIX, all in New Hampshire colors of green
and white. These are now valued collector's items. Recently (1994) an
inferior imitation of these has been put in circulation with a red corporate
logo added.
