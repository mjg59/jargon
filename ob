 OB /ob/ pref. Obligatory. A piece of NETIQUETTE that acknowledges the author
has been straying from the newsgroup's charter. For example, if a posting in
alt.sex has nothing particularly to do with sex, the author may append
"ObSex" (or "Obsex") and toss off a question or vignette about some unusual
erotic act.
