 :batch: adj. 1. Non-interactive. Hackers use this somewhat more loosely than
the traditional technical definitions justify; in particular, switches on a
normally interactive program that prepare it to receive non-interactive
command input are often referred to as `batch mode' switches. A `batch file'
is a series of instructions written to be handed to an interactive program
running in batch mode. 2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting. "I
finally sat down in batch mode and wrote out checks for all those bills; I
guess they'll turn the electricity back on next week..." 3. `batching up':
Accumulation of a number of small tasks that can be lumped together for
greater efficiency. "I'm batching up those letters to send sometime" "I'm
batching up bottles to take to the recycling center."
