 :4.2: /for poynt too/ n. Without a prefix, this almost invariably refers to
{BSD} Unix release 4.2. Note that it is an indication of cluelessness to say
"version 4.2", and "release 4.2" is rare; the number stands on its own, or is
used in the more explicit forms 4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2. Similar
remarks apply to "4.3", "4.4" and to earlier, less-widespread releases 4.1
and 2.9.
