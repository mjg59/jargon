 :4.2: n. Without a prefix, this almost invariably refers to {BSD} UNIX
release 4.2. Note that it is an indication of cluelessness to say "version
4.2", and "release 4.2" is rare; the number stands on its own, or is used in
the more explicit forms 4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2. Similar remarks
apply to "4.3" and to earlier, less-widespread releases 4.1 and 2.9., and
will doubtless apply to 4.4 in the near future.
