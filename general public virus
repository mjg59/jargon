 :General Public Virus: /n./ Pejorative name for some versions of the {GNU}
project {copyleft} or General Public License (GPL), which requires that any
tools or {app}s incorporating copylefted code must be source-distributed on
the same counter-commercial terms as GNU stuff. Thus it is alleged that the
copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools, which may in turn
infect other software that reuses any of its code. The Free Software
Foundation's official position as of January 1991 is that copyright law
limits the scope of the GPL to "programs textually incorporating significant
amounts of GNU code", and that the `infection' is not passed on to third
parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted (as in, for example, use of
the Bison parser skeleton). Nevertheless, widespread suspicion that the
{copyleft} language is `boobytrapped' has caused many developers to avoid
using GNU tools and the GPL. Recent (July 1991) changes in the language of
the version 2.00 license may eliminate this problem.
