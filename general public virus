 GENERAL PUBLIC VIRUS n. Pejorative name for some versions of the GNU project
COPYLEFT (q.v.) or General Public License, which requires that any tools or
apps incorporating copylefted code must be source-distributed on the same
anti-commercial terms as GNU stuff. Thus it is alleged that the copyleft
`infects' software generated with GNU tools. FSF's official position is that
only code incorporating either the Bison parser skeleton or GNU CC libraries
is so infected. Nevertheless, widespread suspicion that the COPYLEFT language
is `boobytrapped' has caused many developers to avoid using GNU tools and the
GPL license.
