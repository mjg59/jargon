 :General Public Virus: n. Pejorative name for some versions of the {GNU}
project {copyleft} or General Public License (GPL), which requires that any
tools or {app}s incorporating copylefted code must be source-distributed on
the same anti-proprietary terms as GNU stuff. Thus it is alleged that the
copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools, which may in turn
infect other software that reuses any of its code. The Free Software
Foundation's official position as of January 1991 is that copyright law
limits the scope of the GPL to "programs textually incorporating significant
amounts of GNU code", and that the `infection' is not passed on to third
parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted. Nevertheless, widespread
suspicion that the {copyleft} language is `boobytrapped' has caused many
developers to avoid using GNU tools and the GPL. Changes in the language of
the version 2.0 GPL did not eliminate this problem.
