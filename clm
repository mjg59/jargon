 CI$: // n. Hackerism for `CIS', CompuServe Information Service. The dollar
sign refers to CompuServe's rather steep line charges. Often used in {sig
block}s just before a CompuServe address. Syn. {Compu$erve}. Classic C:
/klas'ik C/ [a play on `Coke Classic'] n. The C programming language as
defined in the first edition of {K&R}, with some small additions. It is also
known as `K&R C'. The name came into use while C was being standardized by
the ANSI X3J11 committee. Also `C Classic'. This is sometimes applied
elsewhere: thus, `X Classic', where X = Star Trek (referring to the original
TV series) or X = PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed to the
PS/2 series). This construction is especially used of product series in which
the newer versions are considered serious losers relative to the older ones.
clean: 1. adj. Used of hardware or software designs, implies `elegance in the
small', that is, a design or implementation that may not hold any surprises
but does things in a way that is reasonably intuitive and relatively easy to
comprehend from the outside. The antonym is `grungy' or {crufty}. 2. v. To
remove unneeded or undesired files in a effort to reduce clutter: "I'm
cleaning up my account." "I cleaned up the garbage and now have 100 Meg free
on that partition." CLM: /C-L-M/ [Sun: `Career Limiting Move'] 1. n. An
action endangering one's future prospects of getting plum projects and
raises, and possibly one's job: "His Halloween costume was a parody of his
manager. He won the prize for `best CLM'." 2. adj. Denotes extreme severity
of a bug, discovered by a customer and obviously missed earlier because of
poor testing: "That's a CLM bug!" clobber: vt. To overwrite, usually
unintentionally: "I walked off the end of the array and clobbered the stack."
Compare {mung}, {scribble}, {trash}, and {smash the stack}. clocks: n.
Processor logic cycles, so called because each generally corresponds to one
clock pulse in the processor's timing. The relative execution times of
instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks rather than
absolute fractions of a second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds
for various models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it
is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing the
instruction set. Compare {cycle}. clone: n. 1. An exact duplicate: "Our
product is a clone of their product." Implies a legal reimplementation from
documentation or by reverse-engineering. Also connotes lower price. 2. A
shoddy, spurious copy: "Their product is a clone of our product." 3. A
blatant ripoff, most likely violating copyright, patent, or trade secret
protections: "Your product is a clone of my product." This use implies legal
action is pending. 4. A `PC clone'; a PC-BUS/ISA or EISA-compatible
80x86-based microcomputer (this use is sometimes spelled `klone' or
`PClone'). These invariably have much more bang for the buck than the IBM
archetypes they resemble. 5. In the construction `UNIX clone': An OS designed
to deliver a UNIX-lookalike environment without UNIX license fees, or with
additional `mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
programming. 6. v. To make an exact copy of something. "Let me clone that"
might mean "I want to borrow that paper so I can make a photocopy" or "Let me
get a copy of that file before you {mung} it". clover key: [Mac users] n. see
{command key}. clustergeeking: /kluh'st*r-gee`king/ [CMU] n. Spending more
time at a computer cluster doing CS homework than most people spend
breathing.
