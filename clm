 CI$: n. Hackerism for `CIS', Compuserve Information Service. The dollar
refers to CompuServe's rather steep line charges. Often used in {sig block}s
just before a CompuServe address. Classic C: /klas'ik see/ [a play on `Coke
Classic'] n. The C programming language as defined in the first edition of
{K&R}, with some small additions. It is also known as `K&R C'. The name came
into use during the standardization process for C by the ANSI X3J11
committee. Also `C Classic'. This is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus, `X
Classic' where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV series), or X = PC
(referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed to the PS/2 series). This
construction is especially used of product series in which the newer versions
are considered serious losers relative to the older ones. clean: 1. adj. Used
of hardware or software designs, implies `elegance in the small', that is, a
design or implementation which may not hold any surprises but does things in
a way that is reasonably intuitive and relatively easy to comprehend from the
outside. The antonym is `grungy' or {crufty}. 2. v. To remove unneeded or
undesired files in a effort to reduce clutter. "I'm cleaning up my account",
or "I cleaned up the garbage and now have 100 Meg free on that partition".
CLM: /see el em/ [Sun, `Career Limiting Move'] 1. n. An action endangering
one's future prospects of getting plum projects and raises, also possibly
one's job. "He used a {bubble sort}! What a CLM!" 2. adj. Denotes extreme
severity of a bug, discovered by a customer and obviously due to poor
testing: "That's a CLM bug!" clobber: vt. To overwrite; usually
unintentionally. As in "I walked off the end of the array and clobbered the
stack." Compare {mung}, {scribble}, {trash}, and {smash the stack}. clocks:
n. Processor logic cycles, so called because each generally corresponds to
one clock pulse in the processor's timing. The relative execution times of
instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks rather than
absolute fractions of a second. Compare {cycle}. clone: n. 1. An exact
duplicate, as in "Our product is a clone of their product." Implies a legal
re-implementation from documentation or by reverse-engineering. Also connotes
lower price. 2. A shoddy, spurious copy, as in "Their product is a clone of
our product." 3. A blatant ripoff, most likely violating copyright, patent,
or trade secret protections, as in "Your product is a clone of my product."
This usage implies legal action is pending. 4. A `PC clone'; a PC-BUS/ISA or
EISA-compatible 80x86 based microcomputer (this use is sometimes spelled
`klone' or `PClone'). These invariably have much more bang for the buck than
the IBM archetypes they resemble. 5. In the construction `UNIX clone': An OS
designed to deliver a UNIX-lookalike environment sans UNIX license fees, or
with additional `mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
programming. 6. v. To make an exact copy of something. "Let me clone that"
might mean "I want to borrow that paper so I can make a photocopy" or "Let me
get a copy of that file before you {mung} it". clustergeeking:
/kluh'ster-gee`king/ [CMU] n. An activity defined by spending more time at a
computer cluster doing CS homework than most people spend breathing.
