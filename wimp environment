 :WIMP environment: /n./ [acronym: `Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing device (or
Pull-down menu)'] A graphical-user-interface environment such as {X} or the
Macintosh interface, esp. as described by a hacker who prefers command-line
interfaces for their superior flexibility and extensibility. However, it is
also used without negative connotations; one must pay attention to voice tone
and other signals to interpret correctly. see {menuitis}, {user-obsequious}.
