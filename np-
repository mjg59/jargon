 :NP-: /N-P/ pref. Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level or
quality of difficulty; the connotation is often `more so than it should be'
(NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no one has found a
good a priori reason that they should be.) "Coding a BitBlt implementation to
perform correctly in every case is NP-annoying." This is generalized from the
computer-science terms `NP-hard' and `NP-complete'. NP is the set of
Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can be completed by a
nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial
function of the size of the input; a solution for one NP-complete problem
would solve all the others. Note, however, that the NP- prefix is, from a
complexity theorist's point of view, the wrong part of `NP-complete' to
connote extreme difficulty; it is the completeness, not the NP-ness, that
puts any problem it describes in the `hard' category.
