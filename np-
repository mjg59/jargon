 NP- (en pee) pref. Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level
or quality of difficulty. "Getting this algorithm to perform correctly in
every case is NP-annoying." This is generalized from the computer science
terms "NP-hard" and "NP-easy". NP is the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial
algorithms, those which can be completed by a nondeterministic finite state
machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial function of the size of the
input.)
