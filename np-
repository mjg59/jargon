 :NP-: /N-P/ pref. Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level or
quality of difficulty; the connotation is often `more so than it should be'.
This is generalized from the computer-science terms `NP-hard' and
`NP-complete'; NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no
one has found a proof that they are. NP is the set of
Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can be completed by a
nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial
function of the size of the input; a solution for one NP-complete problem
would solve all the others. "Coding a BitBlt implementation to perform
correctly in every case is NP-annoying." Note, however, that strictly
speaking this usage is misleading; there are plenty of easy problems in class
NP. NP-complete problems are hard not because they are in class NP, but
because they are the hardest problems in class NP.
