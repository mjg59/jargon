 :NP-: /N-P/ /pref./ Extremely. Used to modify adjectives describing a level
or quality of difficulty; the connotation is often `more so than it should
be' This is generalized from the computer-science terms `NP-hard' and
`NP-complete'; NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no
one has found a good a priori reason that they should be. NP is the set of
Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can be completed by a
nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of time that is a polynomial
function of the size of the input; a solution for one NP-complete problem
would solve all the others. "Coding a BitBlt implementation to perform
correctly in every case is NP-annoying."
