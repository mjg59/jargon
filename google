 :google: v. [common] To search the Web using the Google search engine,
`http://www.google.com'. Google is highly esteemed among hackers for its
significance ranking system, which is so uncannily effective that many
hackers consider it to have rendered other search engines effectively
irrelevant. The name `google' has additional flavor for hackers because most
know that it was copied from a mathematical term for ten to the hundredth
power, famously first uttered as `googol' by a mathematician's nine-year-old
nephew.
