 :google: v. [common] To search the Web using the Google search engine,
`www.google.com'. Google is highly esteemed among hackers for its
significance ranking system, which is so uncannily effective that many users
consider it to have rendered other search engines effectively irrelevant. The
name `google' has additional flavor for hackers because most know that it was
copied from a mathematical term for ten to the hundredth power, famously
first uttered by a mathematician's infant child.
