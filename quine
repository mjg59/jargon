 :quine: /kwi:n/ [from the name of the logician Willard V. Quine, via Douglas
Hofstadter] n. A program that generates a copy of its own source text as its
complete output. Devising the shortest possible quine in some given
programming language is a common hackish amusement. Here is one classic
quine: ((lambda (x) (list x (list (quote quote) x))) (quote (lambda (x) (list
x (list (quote quote) x))))) This one works in LISP or Scheme. It's
relatively easy to write quines in other languages such as Postscript which
readily handle programs as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in
languages like C which do not. Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines:
char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main() {printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";
main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);} For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove
the interior line breaks. Some infamous {Obfuscated C Contest} entries have
been quines that reproduced in exotic ways.
