 :wrap around: /vi./ (also /n./ `wraparound' and /v./ shorthand `wrap') 1.
[techspeak] The action of a counter that starts over at zero or at `minus
infinity' (see {infinity}) after its maximum value has been reached, and
continues incrementing, either because it is programmed to do so or because
of an overflow (as when a car's odometer starts over at 0). 2. To change
{phase} gradually and continuously by maintaining a steady wake-sleep cycle
somewhat longer than 24 hours, e.g., living six long (28-hour) days in a week
(or, equivalently, sleeping at the rate of 10 microhertz). This sense is also
called {phase-wrapping}.
