 :virtual shredder: n. The jargonic equivalent of the {bit bucket} at shops
using IBM's VM/CMS operating system. VM/CMS officially supports a whole
bestiary of virtual card readers, virtual printers, and other phantom
devices; these are used to supply some of the same capabilities UNIX gets
from pipes and I/O redirection.
