 BIFF /bif/ [USENET] n. The most famous PSEUDO, and the prototypical NEWBIE.
Articles from BIFF are characterized by all upper case letters sprinkled
liberally with BANGS, typos, "cute" misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD
BIFF CUZ HE"S A K00L DOOD AN HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS
LIKE THIS!!!), a long SIG (sometimes even a DOUBLED SIG), and unbounded
naivete. BIFF posts articles using his elder brother's VIC-20. BIFF's
location is a mystery, as his articles appear to come from a variety of
sites. However, BITNET seems to be the most frequent origin. The theory that
BIFF is a denizen of BITNET is supported by BIFF's (unfortunately invalid)
electronic mail address: BIFF@BIT.NET. see also DOUBLED SIG.
