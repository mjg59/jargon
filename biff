 :biff: /bif/ vt. To notify someone of incoming mail. From the BSD utility
`biff(1)', which was in turn named after a friendly golden Labrador who used
to chase frisbees in the halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in development (it had
a well-known habit of barking whenever the mailman came). No relation to
{BIFF}.
