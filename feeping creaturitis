 FEEPING CREATURITIS /fee'ping kree`ch@r-ie'tis/ n. Deliberate spoonerization
of CREEPING FEATURITIS, meant to imply that the system or program in question
has become a misshapen creature of hacks.This term isn't really well-defined,
but it sounds so neat that most hackers have said or heard it. It probably
derives from an image of terminals prowling about in the dark making their
customary noises.
