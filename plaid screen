 :plaid screen: [XEROX PARC] n. A `special effect' which occurs when certain
kinds of {memory smash}es overwrite the control blocks or image memory of a
bit-mapped display. The term "salt & pepper" may refer to a different pattern
of similar origin. Though the term as coined at PARC refers to the result of
an error, some of the {X} demos induce plaid-screen effects deliberately as a
{display hack}.
