 :plaid screen: /n./ [XEROX PARC] A `special effect' that occurs when certain
kinds of {memory smash}es overwrite the control blocks or image memory of a
bit-mapped display. The term "salt and pepper" may refer to a different
pattern of similar origin. Though the term as coined at PARC refers to the
result of an error, some of the {X} demos induce plaid-screen effects
deliberately as a {display hack}.
