 :smoke and mirrors: n. Marketing deceptions. The term is mainstream in this
general sense. Among hackers it's strongly associated with bogus demos and
crocked {benchmark}s (see also {MIPS}, {machoflops}). "They claim their new
box cranks 50 MIPS for under $5000, but didn't specify the instruction mix
--- sounds like smoke and mirrors to me." The phrase has been said to derive
from carnie slang for magic acts and `freak show' displays that depend on
`trompe l'oeil' effects, but also calls to mind the fierce Aztec god
Tezcatlipoca (lit. "Smoking Mirror") for whom the hearts of huge numbers of
human sacrificial victims were regularly cut out. Upon hearing about a rigged
demo or yet another round of fantasy-based marketing promises, hackers often
feel analogously disheartened.
