 :DWIM: /dwim/ [acronym, `Do What I Mean'] 1. adj. Able to guess, sometimes
even correctly, the result intended when bogus input was provided. 2. n. obs.
The BBNLISP/INTERLISP function that attempted to accomplish this feat by
correcting many of the more common errors. see {hairy}. 3. Occasionally, an
interjection hurled at a balky computer, esp. when one senses one might be
tripping over legalisms (see {legalese}). 4. Of a person, someone whose
directions are incomprehensible and vague, but who nevertheless has the
expectation that you will solve the problem using the specific method he/she
has in mind. Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and
spelling errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would
often make hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.
Some victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for `Damn Warren's
Infernal Machine!'. In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to
the command interpreter used at Xerox PARC. One day another hacker there
typed delete *$ to free up some disk space. (The editor there named backup
files by appending $ to the original file name, so he was trying to delete
any backup files left over from old editing sessions.) It happened that there
weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported *$ not found,
assuming you meant 'delete *'. It then started to delete all the files on the
disk! The hacker managed to stop it with a {Vulcan nerve pinch} after only a
half dozen or so files were lost. The disgruntled victim later said he had
been sorely tempted to go to Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in
front of his workstation, and then type delete *$ twice. DWIM is often
suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex program; it is also
occasionally described as the single instruction the ideal computer would
have. Back when proofs of program correctness were in vogue, there were also
jokes about DWIMC (Do What I Mean, Correctly). A related term, more often
seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing); see {Right Thing}.
