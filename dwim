 DWIM: /dwim/ [Do What I Mean] 1. adj. Able to guess, sometimes even
correctly, the result intended when bogus input was provided. 2. n.,obs. The
BBNLISP/INTERLISP function that attempted to accomplish this feat by
correcting many of the more common errors. see {hairy}. 3. Occasionally, an
interjection hurled at a balky computer, esp. when one senses one might be
tripping over legalisms (see {legalese}). Warren Teitelman originally wrote
DWIM to fix his typos and spelling errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic
to his style, and would often make hash of anyone else's typos if they were
stylistically different. This led a number of victims of DWIM to claim the
acronym stood for "Damn Warren's Infernal Machine!" DWIM is often suggested
in jest as a desired feature for a complex program; also, occasionally
described as the single instruction the ideal computer would have. Back when
proofs of program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about
`DWIMC': Do What I Mean, Correctly). A related term, more often seen as a
verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing), see {Right Thing}. dynner: /din'r/ 32
bits, by analogy with {nybble} and {{byte}}. Usage: rare and extremely silly.

ultimate real-world shock test for computer hardware. Hackish sources at IBM
deny the rumor that the Bay Area quake of 1989 was initiated by the company
to test quality assurance procedures at its California plants. Easter egg: n.
1. A message hidden in the object code of a program as a joke, intended to be
found by persons disassembling or browsing the code. 2. A message, graphic,
or sound-effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in response
to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes, intended as a joke or to
display program credits. One well-known early Easter egg found in a couple of
OSes caused them to respond to the command `make love' with `not war?'. Many
personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM, including
lists of the developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music,
and (in one case) graphics images of the entire development team. Easter
egging: [IBM] n. The act of replacing unrelated parts more or less at random
in hopes that a malfunction will go away. Hackers consider this the normal
operating mode of {field circus} techs and do not love them for it. Compare
{shotgun debugging}. eat flaming death: imp. A construction popularized among
hackers by the infamous {CPU Wars} comic; supposed to derive from a famously
turgid line in a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic which ran "Eat flaming
death, non-Aryan mongrels!" or something of the sort (however, it is also
reported that the Firesign Theater's 1975 album `In The Next World, You're On
Your Own' included the phrase "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs"; this
may have been an influence). Used in humorously overblown expressions of
hostility. "Eat flaming death, {{EBCDIC}} users!"
