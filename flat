 :flat: adj. 1. [common] Lacking any complex internal structure. "That {bitty
box} has only a flat filesystem, not a hierarchical one." The verb form is
{flatten}. 2. Said of a memory architecture (like that of the VAX or 680x0)
that is one big linear address space (typically with each possible value of a
processor register corresponding to a unique core address), as opposed to a
`segmented' architecture (like that of the 80x86) in which addresses are
composed from a base-register/offset pair (segmented designs are generally
considered {cretinous}). Note that sense 1 (at least with respect to
filesystems) is usually used pejoratively, while sense 2 is a {Good Thing}.
