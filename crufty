 :crufty: /kruhf'tee/ /adj./ [origin unknown; poss. from `crusty' or
`cruddy'] 1. Poorly built, possibly over-complex. The {canonical} example is
"This is standard old crufty {DEC} software". In fact, one fanciful theory of
the origin of `crufty' holds that was originally a mutation of `crusty'
applied to DEC software so old that the `s' characters were tall and skinny,
looking more like `f' characters. 2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch,
often with encrusted junk. Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and
catsup. 3. Generally unpleasant. 4. (sometimes spelled `cruftie') /n./ A
small crufty object (see {frob}); often one that doesn't fit well into the
scheme of things. "A LISP property list is a good place to store crufties
(or, collectively, {random} cruft)."
