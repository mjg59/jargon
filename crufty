 CRUFTY /kruhf'tee/ [origin unknown; poss. from "crusty" or "cruddy"] adj. 1.
Poorly built, possibly overly complex. The CANONICAL example is "This is
standard old crufty DEC software". In fact, one theory of the origin of
"crufty" holds that was originally a mutation of "crusty" applied to DEC
software so old that the Ss were tall and skinny, looking more like Fs. Hence
CRUFT, n. shoddy construction. 2. Unpleasant, especially to the touch, often
with encrusted junk. Like spilled coffee smeared with peanut butter and
catsup. 3. Generally unpleasant. CRUFTY or CRUFTIE n. A small crufty object
(see FROB); often one which doesn't fit well into the scheme of things. "A
LISP property list is a good place to store crufties (or, random cruft)."
