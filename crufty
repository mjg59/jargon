Also CRUFT, v. [from hand cruft, pun on hand craft] to write assembler code
for something normally (and better) done by a compiler. 2. Unpleasant,
especially to the touch, often with encrusted junk. Like spilled coffee

Generally unpleasant. CRUFTY or CRUFTIE n. A small crufty object (see FROB);
often one which doesn't fit well into the scheme of things. "A LISP property
list is a good place to store crufties (or, random cruft)." [Note: Does CRUFT
have anything to do with the Cruft Lab at Harvard? I don't know, though I was
a Harvard student. - GLS]
