 :buffer overflow: n. What happens when you try to stuff more data into a
buffer (holding area) than it can handle. This problem is commonly exploited
by {cracker}s to get arbitrary commands executed by a program running with
root permissions. This may be due to a mismatch in the processing rates of
the producing and consuming processes (see {overrun} and {firehose
syndrome}), or because the buffer is simply too small to hold all the data
that must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed. For example, in a
text-processing tool that {crunch}es a line at a time, a short line buffer
can result in {lossage} as input from a long line overflows the buffer and
trashes data beyond it. Good defensive programming would check for overflow
on each character and stop accepting data when the buffer is full up. The
term is used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense. "What time did I agree
to meet you? My buffer must have overflowed." Or "If I answer that phone my
buffer is going to overflow." see also {spam}, {overrun screw}.
