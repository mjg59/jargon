 :Swiss-Army chainsaw: In early Unix days, a well-known technical paper
analogized the lexical analyzer lex(1) to a Swiss-army knife; this was a
comment on the remarkable variety of more general uses discovered for a
program originally designed as a special-purpose code generator for writing
compilers. Two decades later, well-known hacker Henry Spencer described the
{Perl} scripting language as a "Swiss-Army chainsaw", intending to convey his
evaluation of the language as exceedingly powerful but ugly and noisy and
prone to belch noxious fumes. This had two results: (1) Perl fans adopted the
epithet as a badge of pride, and (2) it entered more general usage to
describe software that is highly versatile but distressingly inelegant.
