 :camelCase: A variable in a programming language is sait to be camelCased
when all words but the first are capitalized. This practice contrasts with
the C tradition of either running syllables together or marking syllable
breaks with underscores; thus, where a C programmer would write
thisverylongname or this_very_long_name, the camelCased version would be
thisVeryLongName. This practice is common in certain language communities
(formerly Pascal; today Java and Visual Basic) and tends to be associated
with object-oriented programming. Compare {BiCapitalization}; but where that
practice is primarily associated with marketing, camelCasing is not aimed at
impressing anybody, and hackers consider it respectable.
