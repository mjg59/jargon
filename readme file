 :README file: n. Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the
top-level directory of a UNIX source distribution, containing a pointer to
more detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision history, notes,
etc. (The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or
readme.txt or some other variant.) In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not
usually distributed in source form, and the README is more likely to contain
user-oriented material like last-minute documentation changes, error
workarounds, and restrictions. When asked, hackers invariably relate the
README convention to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures
In Wonderland" in which Alice confronts magic munchies labeled "Eat Me" and
"Drink Me".
