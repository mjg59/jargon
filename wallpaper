 :wallpaper: n. 1. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly listing) or a
transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all or part of a login
session. (The idea was that the paper for such listings was essentially good
only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford, where it was used to cover
windows.) Now rare, esp. since other systems have developed other terms for
it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). However, the Unix world doesn't have an
equivalent term, so perhaps {wallpaper} will take hold there. The term
probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end transcript
files were `:WALBEG' and `:WALEND', with default file `WALL PAPER' (the space
was a path delimiter). 2. The background pattern used on graphical
workstations (this is techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface
to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that contains the wallpaper
information before it is actually printed on paper. (Even if you don't intend
ever to produce a real paper copy of the file, it is still called a wallpaper
file.)
