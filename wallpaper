 WALLPAPER n. 1. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly listing) or
transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all or part of a login
session. (The idea was that the LPT paper for such listings was essentially
good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford where it was used as such
to cover windows.) Usage: not often used now, esp. since other systems have
developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). However, the UNIX world
doesn't have an equivalent term, so perhaps WALLPAPER will take hold there.
The term probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end
transcript files were :WALBEG and :WALEND, with default file DSK:WALL PAPER.
2. The background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is jargon
under the "Windows" graphical user interface to MS-DOS). 3. WALLPAPER FILE n.
The file that contains the wallpaper information before it is actually
printed on paper. (Sometimes you don't intend ever to produce a real paper
copy of the file, because you can look at the file directly on your terminal,
but it is still called a "wallpaper file".)
