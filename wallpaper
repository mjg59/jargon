 WALLPAPER n. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly listing) or
transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all or part of a login
session. (The idea was that the LPT paper for such listings was essentially
good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at SAIL where it was used as such to
cover windows.) Usage: not often used now, esp. since other systems have
developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). The term possibly
originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end transcript files were
:WALBEG and :WALEND, with default file DSK:WALL PAPER.
