 :crlf: /ker´l@f/, /kru´l@f/, /C·R·L·F/, n. (often capitalized as `CRLF') A
carriage return (CR, ASCII 0001101) followed by a line feed (LF, ASCII
0001010). More loosely, whatever it takes to get you from the end of one line
of text to the beginning of the next line. see {newline}. Under {Unix}
influence this usage has become less common (Unix uses a bare line feed as
its `CRLF').
