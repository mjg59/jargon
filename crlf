 CRLF /ker'l@f/, sometimes /kru'l@f/ n. A carriage return (CR) followed by a
line feed (LF). More loosely, whatever it takes to get you from the end of
one line of text to the beginning of the next line. see NEWLINE, TERPRI.
Under UNIX influence this usage has become less common (UNIX uses a bare line
feed as its `CRLF').
