 :crlf: /ker'l*f/, sometimes /kru'l*f/ or /C-R-L-F/ n. (often capitalized as
`CRLF') A carriage return (CR, ASCII 0001101) followed by a line feed (LF,
ASCII 0001010). More loosely, whatever it takes to get you from the end of
one line of text to the beginning of the next line. see {newline}, {terpri}.
Under {{UNIX}} influence this usage has become less common (UNIX uses a bare
line feed as its `CRLF').
