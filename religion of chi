 :religion of CHI: n. /ki:/ [Case Western Reserve University] n. Yet another
hackish parody religion (see also {Church of the SubGenius},
{Discordianism}). In the mid-70s, the canonical "Introduction to Programming"
courses at CWRU were taught in Algol, and student exercises were punched on
cards and run on a Univac 1108 system using a homebrew operating system named
CHI. The religion had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever the
worshipper noted that a digital clock read 11:08, he or she would recite the
phrase "It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS, ARCTAN." The last five
words were the first five functions in the appropriate chapter of the Algol
manual; note the special pronunciations /obz/ and /ark'sin/ rather than the
more common /abz/ and /ark'si:n/. Using an alarm clock to warn of 11:08's
arrival was {considered harmful}.
