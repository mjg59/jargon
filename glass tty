 GLASS TTY (glas tee-tee-wie, glas ti-tee) n. A terminal which has a display
screen but which, because of hardware or software limitations, behaves like a
teletype or other printing terminal. An example is the ADM-3 (without cursor
control). A glass tty can't do neat DISPLAY HACKs, and you can't save the
output either. see TUBE, TTY.
