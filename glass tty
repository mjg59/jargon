 :glass tty: /glas T-T-Y/ or /glas ti'tee/ n. A terminal that has a display
screen but which, because of hardware or software limitations, behaves like a
teletype or some other printing terminal, thereby combining the disadvantages
of both: like a printing terminal, it can't do fancy display hacks, and like
a display terminal, it doesn't produce hard copy. An example is the early
`dumb' version of Lear-Siegler ADM 3 (without cursor control). see {tube},
{tty}; compare {dumb terminal}, {smart terminal}. see "{TV Typewriters}"
(Appendix A) for an interesting true story about a glass tty.
