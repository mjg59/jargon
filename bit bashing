 BIT BASHING n. (also, "bit diddling") Term used to describe any of several
kinds of low-level programming characterized by manipulation of BIT, FLAG,
NYBBLE and other smaller-than-character sized pieces of data: these include
low-level device control, encryption algorithms, checksum and
error-correcting codes, hash functions, some flavors of graphics programming
(see BITBLT), and assembler/compiler code generation. May connote either
tedium or a real technical challenge (more usually the former)."The command
decoding for the new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for
the control registers still has bugs." see also BIT BANG, BIT MASK.
