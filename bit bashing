 :bit bashing: n. (alt.: bit diddling or {bit twiddling}) Term used to
describe any of several kinds of low-level programming characterized by
manipulation of {bit}, {flag}, {nybble}, and other
smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level device
control, encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting codes, hash
functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see {bitblt}), and
assembler/compiler code generation. May connote either tedium or a real
technical challenge (more usually the former). "The command decoding for the
new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for the control
registers still has bugs." see also {mode bit}.
