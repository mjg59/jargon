 :depeditate: /dee-ped'*-tayt/ /n./ [by (faulty) analogy with `decapitate']
Humorously, to cut off the feet of. When one is using some computer-aided
typesetting tools, careless placement of text blocks within a page or above a
rule can result in chopped-off letter descenders. Such letters are said to
have been depeditated.
