 WALDO [probably taken from the story "Waldo", by Heinlein, which is where
the term was first used to mean a mechanical adjunct to a human limb] Used at
Harvard, particularly by Tom Cheatham and students, instead of FOOBAR as a
meta-syntactic variable and general nonsense word. see FOO, BAR, FOOBAR,
QUUX.
