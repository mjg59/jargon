 :waldo: /wol'doh/ /n./ [From Robert A. Heinlein's story "Waldo"] 1. A
mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm, controlled by a human limb. When
these were developed for the nuclear industry in the mid-1940s they were
named after the invention described by Heinlein in the story, which he wrote
in 1942. Now known by the more generic term `telefactoring', this technology
is of intense interest to NASA for tasks like space station maintenance. 2.
At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students), this is used instead
of {foobar} as a metasyntactic variable and general nonsense word. see {foo},
{bar}, {foobar}, {quux}.
