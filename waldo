 WALDO /wol'doh/ [probably taken from the story "Waldo", by Heinlein, which
is where the term was first used to mean a mechanical adjunct to a human
limb] At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students) this is used
instead of FOOBAR as a meta-syntactic variable and general nonsense word. see
FOO, BAR, FOOBAR, QUUX.
