 MODULO /mod'yuh-low/ prep. Except for. From mathematical terminology: one
can consider saying that 4=22 "except for the 9's" (4=22 mod 9) (the precise
meaning is a bit more complicated, but that's the idea). "Well, LISP seems to
work okay now, modulo that GC bug." "I feel fine today modulo a slight
headache."
