 BRAIN-DAMAGED [generalization of "Honeywell Brain Damage" (HBD), a
theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in Honeywell
MULTICS] adj. Obviously wrong; CRETINOUS; DEMENTED. There is an implication
that the person responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he
should have known better. Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it
also implies it is unusable, and that its failure to work is due to poor
design rather than some accident.
