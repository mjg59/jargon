 BRAIN-DAMAGED (brayn'dam-@jd) [generalization of "Honeywell Brain Damage"
(HBD), a theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in
MULTICS] adj. Obviously wrong; CRETINOUS; DEMENTED. There is an implication
that the person responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he
should have known better. Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it
also implies it is unusable.
