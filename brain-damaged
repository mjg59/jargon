 BRAIN-DAMAGED [generalization of "Honeywell Brain Damage" (HBD), a
theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in Multics]
adj. Obviously wrong; cre- tinous; demented. There is an implication that the
per- son responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he should have
known better. Calling something brain- damaged is really bad; it also implies
it is unusable.
