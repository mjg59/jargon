 CYBERPUNK (sie'ber-puhnk) [orig. by SF critic Gardner Dozois] n.,adj. A
subgenre of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
_Neuromancer_. Gibson's near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day
hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and
hackers in futures in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly naive
and tremendously stimulating. Gibson's work was widely imitated, in
particular by the short-lived but innovative "Max Headroom" TV series. see
