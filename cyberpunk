 :Food: ====== Ethnic. Spicy. Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan,
Hunan, and Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely d'eclass'e). Hackers
prefer the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will eat
with gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale. Thai
food has experienced flurries of popularity. Where available, high-quality
Jewish delicatessen food is much esteemed. A visible minority of Southwestern
and Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican. For those all-night hacks, pizza
and microwaved burritos are big. Interestingly, though the mainstream culture
has tended to think of hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have
at least mildly health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about
what they eat. This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark before the early 1980s. :Politics: ==========
Vaguely liberal-moderate, except for the strong libertarian contingent which
rejects conventional left-right politics entirely. The only safe
generalization is that hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; thus,
both conventional conservatism and `hard' leftism are rare. Hackers are far
more likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or
(b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to
live by them day-to-day. :Gender and Ethnicity: ======================
Hackerdom is still predominantly male. However, the percentage of women is
clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical
professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with as
equals. In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong
minorities of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast). The Jewish
contingent has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see
{Food}, above, and note that several common jargon terms are obviously
mutated Yiddish). The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to
be a function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education. Racial
and ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing
contempt. When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this
is doubtless a powerful influence. Also, the ties many hackers have to AI
research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of
personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive --- after all, if one's
imagination readily grants full human rights to future AI programs, robots,
dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very
important any more. :Religion: ========== Agnostic. Atheist. Non-observant
Jewish. Neo-pagan. Very commonly, three or more of these are combined in the
same person. Conventional faith-holding Christianity is rare though not
unknown. Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be
relaxed about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of
religious bigotry in particular. Many enjoy `parody' religions such as
Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius. Also, many hackers are
influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or (less commonly) Taoism, and
blend them easily with their `native' religions. There is a definite strain
of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that shows up even among those
hackers not actively involved with neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen.
Hacker folklore that pays homage to `wizards' and speaks of incantations and
demons has too much psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a
joke. :Ceremonial Chemicals: ====================== Most hackers don't smoke
tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at all (though there is a visible
contingent of exotic-beer fanciers, and a few hackers are serious
oenophiles). Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as
cannabis, LSD, psilocybin, and nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively
common and is still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream
culture. Use of `downers' and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be
particularly rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make them
stupid. On the third hand, many hackers regularly wire up on caffeine and/or
sugar for all-night hacking runs. :Communication Style: =====================
see the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of this
File. Though hackers often have poor person-to-person communication skills,
they are as a rule quite sensitive to nuances of language and very precise in
their use of it. They are often better at writing than at speaking.
:Geographical Distribution: =========================== In the United States,
hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis; about half of the hard core
seems to live within a hundred miles of Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley
(California), although there are significant contingents in Los Angeles, in
the Pacific Northwest, and around Washington DC. Hackers tend to cluster
around large cities, especially `university towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham
area in North Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the
fact that many are students or ex-students living near their alma maters).
:Sexual Habits: =============== Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range
of sexual and lifestyle variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a
relatively large gay and bisexual contingent. Hackers are somewhat more
likely to live in polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open
marriage, or live in communes or group houses. In this, as in general
appearance, hackerdom semi-consciously maintains `counterculture' values.
:Personality Characteristics: ============================= The most obvious
common `personality' characteristics of hackers are high intelligence,
consuming curiosity, and facility with intellectual abstractions. Also, most
hackers are `neophiles', stimulated by and appreciative of novelty
(especially intellectual novelty). Most are also relatively individualistic
and anti-conformist. Although high general intelligence is common among
hackers, it is not the sine qua non one might expect. Another trait is
probably even more important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain, and
reference large amounts of `meaningless' detail, trusting to later experience
to give it context and meaning. A person of merely average analytical
intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but a
creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by people
who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their
brains. [During the production of the first book version of this document,
for example, I learned most of the rather complex typesetting language TeX
over about four working days, mainly by inhaling Knuth's 477-page manual. My
editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely surprised me, because years
of associating with hackers have conditioned me to consider such performances
routine and to be expected. -- ESR] Contrary to stereotype, hackers are *not*
usually intellectually narrow; they tend to be interested in any subject that
can provide mental stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and
even interestingly on any number of obscure subjects -- if you can get them
to talk at all, as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking. It is
noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the better a
hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have outside interests
at which he or she is more than merely competent. Hackers are `control
freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with the usual coercive or
authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same way that children delight
in making model trains go forward and back by moving a switch, hackers love
making complicated things like computers do nifty stuff for them. But it has
to be *their* nifty stuff. They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of
the fussy, boring, ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal
existence. Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their
intellectual lives and chaotic elsewhere. Their code will be beautiful, even
if their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap. Hackers are generally only very
weakly motivated by conventional rewards such as social approval or money.
They tend to be attracted by challenges and excited by interesting toys, and
to judge the interest of work or other activities in terms of the challenges
offered and the toys they get to play with. In terms of Myers-Briggs and
equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom appears to concentrate the
relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, introverted, intuitive, and
thinker types (as opposed to the extroverted-sensate personalities that
predominate in the mainstream culture). ENT[JP] types are also concentrated
among hackers but are in a minority. :Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality:
====================================== Hackers have relatively little ability
to identify emotionally with other people. This may be because hackers
generally aren't much like `other people'. Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend
towards self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people
and tasks perceived to be wasting their time. As cynical as hackers sometimes
wax about the amount of idiocy in the world, they tend by reflex to assume
that everyone is as rational, `cool', and imaginative as they consider
themselves. This bias often contributes to weakness in communication skills.
Hackers tend to be especially poor at confrontation and negotiation. Because
of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the {Right Thing},
hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted on technical issues, in
marked contrast to their general spirit of camaraderie and tolerance of
alternative viewpoints otherwise. Old-time {{ITS}} partisans look down on the
ever-growing hordes of {{Unix}} hackers; Unix aficionados despise {VMS} and
{{MS-DOS}}; and hackers who are used to conventional command-line user
interfaces loudly loathe mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh.
Hackers who don't indulge in {Usenet} consider it a huge waste of time and
{bandwidth}; fans of old adventure games such as {ADVENT} and {Zork} consider
{MUD}s to be glorified chat systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting
puzzles; hackers who are willing to devote endless hours to Usenet or MUDs
consider {IRC} to be a *real* waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay
if there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way. And, of course, there
are the perennial {holy wars} -- {EMACS} vs. {vi}, {big-endian} vs.
{little-endian}, RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc., etc. As in society at large, the
intensity and duration of these debates is usually inversely proportional to
the number of objective, factual arguments available to buttress any
position. As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships. At worst, they can produce the classic
{computer geek}: withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually frustrated,
and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft. Fortunately,
this extreme is far less common than mainstream folklore paints it -- but
almost all hackers will recognize something of themselves in the unflattering
paragraphs above. Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy
about dealing with the physical world. Bills don't get paid on time, clutter
piles up to incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance
tasks get deferred indefinitely. 1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a
syndrome called Attention Deficit Disorder, supposedly characterized by
(among other things) a combination of short attention span with an ability to
`hyperfocus' imaginatively on interesting tasks. There are grounds for
questioning whether ADD actually exists, and if it does whether it is really
a `disease' rather than an extreme of a normal genetic variation like having
freckles or being able to taste DPT; but it is certainly true that many
hacker traits coincide with major indicators for ADD, and probably true that
ADD boosters would find a far higher rate of clinical ADD among hackers than
the supposedly mainstream-normal 10%. The sort of person who routinely uses
phrases like `incompletely socialized' usually thinks hackers are. Hackers
regard such people with contempt when they notice them at all.
:Miscellaneous: =============== Hackers are more likely to have cats than
dogs (in fact, it is widely grokked that cats have the hacker nature). Many
drive incredibly decrepit heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive
spiffy Porsches and RX-7s and then forget to have them washed. Almost all
hackers have terribly bad handwriting, and often fall into the habit of
block-printing everything like junior draftsmen. :Helping Hacker Culture
Grow: ***************************** If you enjoyed the Jargon File, please
help the culture that created it grow and flourish. Here are several ways you
can help: * If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write {hacker}
when you mean {cracker}. If you work with writers or journalists, educate
them on this issue and push them to do the right thing. * If you're a techie
or computer hobbyist, get involved with one of the free Unixes. Toss out that
lame Microsoft OS, or confine it to one disk partition and put Linux or
FreeBSD or NetBSD on the other one. And the next time your friend or boss is
thinking about some commercial software `solution' that costs more than it's
worth, be ready to blow the competition away with free software running over
a free Unix. * Contribute to organizations like the Free Software Foundation
that promote the production of high-quality free software. You can reach the
Free Software Foundation at gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu, by phone at +1-617-542-5942,
or by snail-mail at 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA. *
Support the League for Programming Freedom, which opposes over-broad software
patents that constantly threaten to blow up in hackers' faces. preventing
them from developing innovative software for tomorrow's needs. You can reach

************** Here are some other books you can read to help you understand
the hacker mindset. :G"odel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid: Douglas
Hofstadter Basic Books, 1979 ISBN 0-394-74502-7 This book reads like an
intellectual Grand Tour of hacker preoccupations. Music, mathematical logic,
programming, speculations on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen are
woven into a brilliant tapestry themed on the concept of encoded
self-reference. The perfect left-brain companion to "Illuminatus".
:Illuminatus!: I. "The Eye in the Pyramid" II. "The Golden Apple" III.
"Leviathan". Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson Dell, 1988 ISBN
0-440-53981-1 This work of alleged fiction is an incredible
berserko-surrealist rollercoaster of world-girdling conspiracies, intelligent
dolphins, the fall of Atlantis, who really killed JFK, sex, drugs,
rock'n'roll, and the Cosmic Giggle Factor. First published in three volumes,
but there is now a one-volume trade paperback, carried by most chain
bookstores under SF. The perfect right-brain companion to Hofstadter's
"G"odel, Escher, Bach". see {Eris}, {Discordianism}, {random numbers},
{Church of the SubGenius}. :The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Douglas
Adams Pocket Books, 1981 ISBN 0-671-46149-4 This `Monty Python in Space'
spoof of SF genre traditions has been popular among hackers ever since the
original British radio show. Read it if only to learn about Vogons (see
{bogon}) and the significance of the number 42 (see {random numbers}) -- and
why the winningest chess program of 1990 was called `Deep Thought'. :The Tao
of Programming: James Geoffrey Infobooks, 1987 ISBN 0-931137-07-1 This
gentle, funny spoof of the "Tao Te Ching" contains much that is illuminating
about the hacker way of thought. "When you have learned to snatch the error
code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave." :Hackers: Steven
Levy Anchor/Doubleday 1984 ISBN 0-385-19195-2 Levy's book is at its best in
describing the early MIT hackers at the Model Railroad Club and the early
days of the microcomputer revolution. He never understood Unix or the
networks, though, and his enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true
hacker" turns out (thankfully) to have been quite misleading. Numerous minor
factual errors also mar the text; for example, Levy's claim that the original
Jargon File derived from the TMRC Dictionary (the File originated at Stanford
and was brought to MIT in 1976; the co-authors of the first edition had never
seen the dictionary in question). There are also numerous misspellings in the
book that inflame the passions of old-timers; as Dan Murphy, the author of
TECO, once said: "You would have thought he'd take the trouble to spell the
name of a winning editor right." Nevertheless, this remains a useful and
stimulating book that captures the feel of several important hackish
subcultures. :The Computer Contradictionary: Stan Kelly-Bootle MIT Press,
1995 ISBN 0-262-61112-0 This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is
similar in format to the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from TNHD-2)
but somewhat different in tone and intent. It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and quirky
imagination. For example, it defines `computer science' as "a study akin to
numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision of the former and the
success of the latter" and `implementation' as "The fruitless struggle by the
talented and underpaid to fulfill promises made by the rich and ignorant";
`flowchart' becomes "to obfuscate a problem with esoteric cartoons". Revised
and expanded from "The Devil's DP Dictionary", McGraw-Hill 1981, ISBN
0-07-034022-6. :The Devouring Fungus: Tales from the Computer Age: Karla
Jennings Norton, 1990 ISBN 0-393-30732-8 The author of this pioneering
compendium knits together a great deal of computer- and hacker-related
folklore with good writing and a few well-chosen cartoons. She has a keen eye
for the human aspects of the lore and is very good at illuminating the
psychology and evolution of hackerdom. Unfortunately, a number of small
errors and awkwardnesses suggest that she didn't have the final manuscript
checked over by a native speaker; the glossary in the back is particularly
embarrassing, and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold
here under {A Story About `Magic'} in Appendix A is given in incomplete and
badly mangled form. Nevertheless, this book is a win overall and can be
enjoyed by hacker and non-hacker alike. :The Soul of a New Machine: Tracy
Kidder Little, Brown, 1981 (paperback: Avon, 1982 ISBN 0-380-59931-7) This
book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the adventure of the design of
a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle. It is an amazingly well-done
portrait of the hacker mindset -- although largely the hardware hacker --
done by a complete outsider. It is a bit thin in spots, but with enough
technical information to be entertaining to the serious hacker while
providing non-technical people a view of what day-to-day life can be like --
the fun, the excitement, the disasters. During one period, when the microcode
and logic were glitching at the nanosecond level, one of the overworked
engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on his terminal as his
letter of resignation: "I am going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with
no unit of time shorter than a season." :Life with UNIX: a Guide for
Everyone: Don Libes and Sandy Ressler Prentice-Hall, 1989 ISBN 0-13-536657-7
The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things about Unix that
tutorials and technical books won't. The result is gossipy, funny,
opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable. Along the way they
expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and humor to qualify as a
first-class source for these things. Because so much of today's hackerdom is
involved with Unix, this in turn illuminates many of its in-jokes and
preoccupations. :True Names ... and Other Dangers: Vernor Vinge Baen Books,
1987 ISBN 0-671-65363-6 Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to say that the
title story of this book "expresses the spirit of hacking best". Until the
subject of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate another
contender. The other stories in this collection are also fine work by an
author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very best
practitioners of hard SF. :Snow Crash: Neal Stephenson Bantam, 1992 ISBN
0-553-56261-4 Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing
about the hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of
fiction has ever even approached. His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of hacking
and its results are astonishing, delightful, and (so far) unsurpassed.
