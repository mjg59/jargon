 :Religion: ========== Agnostic. Atheist. Non-observant Jewish. Neo-pagan.
Very commonly, three or more of these are combined in the same person.
Conventional faith-holding Christianity is rare though not unknown. Even
hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be relaxed about
it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of religious
bigotry in particular. Many enjoy `parody' religions such as Discordianism
and the Church of the SubGenius. Also, many hackers are influenced to varying
degrees by Zen Buddhism or (less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with
their `native' religions. There is a definite strain of mystical, almost
Gnostic sensibility that shows up even among those hackers not actively
involved with neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen. Hacker folklore that pays
homage to `wizards' and speaks of incantations and demons has too much
psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke. :Ceremonial
Chemicals: ====================== Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use
alcohol in moderation if at all. However, there has been something of a trend
towards exotic beers since about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers
apparently influenced by Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guinness. Limited use
of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, psilocybin,
nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is still regarded with
more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. Use of `downers' and opiates,
on the other hand, appears to be particularly rare; hackers seem in general
to dislike drugs that make them stupid. But {on the gripping hand}, many
hackers regularly wire up on caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking
runs. :Communication Style: ===================== see the discussions of
speech and writing styles near the beginning of this File. Though hackers
often have poor person-to-person communication skills, they are as a rule
quite sensitive to nuances of language and very precise in their use of it.
They are often better at writing than at speaking. :Geographical
Distribution: =========================== In the United States, hackerdom
revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis; about half of the hard core seems to
live within a hundred miles of Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley
(California), although there are significant contingents in Los Angeles, in
the Pacific Northwest, and around Washington DC. Hackers tend to cluster
around large cities, especially `university towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham
area in North Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the
fact that many are students or ex-students living near their alma maters).
:Sexual Habits: =============== Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range
of sexual and lifestyle variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a
relatively large gay and bisexual contingent. Hackers are somewhat more
likely to live in polygynous or polyandrous relationships, practice open
marriage, or live in communes or group houses. In this, as in general
appearance, hackerdom semi-consciously maintains `counterculture' values.
:Personality Characteristics: ============================= The most obvious
common `personality' characteristics of hackers are high intelligence,
consuming curiosity, and facility with intellectual abstractions. Also, most
hackers are `neophiles', stimulated by and appreciative of novelty
(especially intellectual novelty). Most are also relatively individualistic
and anti-conformist. Although high general intelligence is common among
hackers, it is not the sine qua non one might expect. Another trait is
probably even more important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain, and
reference large amounts of `meaningless' detail, trusting to later experience
to give it context and meaning. A person of merely average analytical
intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but a
creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by people
who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their
brains. [During the production of the first book version of this document,
for example, I learned most of the rather complex typesetting language TeX
over about four working days, mainly by inhaling Knuth's 477-page manual. My
editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely surprised me, because years
of associating with hackers have conditioned me to consider such performances
routine and to be expected. --ESR] Contrary to stereotype, hackers are _not_
usually intellectually narrow; they tend to be interested in any subject that
can provide mental stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and
even interestingly on any number of obscure subjects -- if you can get them
to talk at all, as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking. It is
noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the better a
hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have outside interests
at which he or she is more than merely competent. Hackers are `control
freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with the usual coercive or
authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same way that children delight
in making model trains go forward and back by moving a switch, hackers love
making complicated things like computers do nifty stuff for them. But it has
to be _their_ nifty stuff. They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of
the fussy, boring, ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal
existence. Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their
intellectual lives and chaotic elsewhere. Their code will be beautiful, even
if their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap. Hackers are generally only very
weakly motivated by conventional rewards such as social approval or money.
They tend to be attracted by challenges and excited by interesting toys, and
to judge the interest of work or other activities in terms of the challenges
offered and the toys they get to play with. In terms of Myers-Briggs and
equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom appears to concentrate the
relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, introverted, intuitive, and
thinker types (as opposed to the extroverted-sensate personalities that
predominate in the mainstream culture). ENT[JP] types are also concentrated
among hackers but are in a minority. :Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality:
====================================== Hackers have relatively little ability
to identify emotionally with other people. This may be because hackers
generally aren't much like `other people'. Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend
towards self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people
and tasks perceived to be wasting their time. As cynical as hackers sometimes
wax about the amount of idiocy in the world, they tend by reflex to assume
that everyone is as rational, `cool', and imaginative as they consider
themselves. This bias often contributes to weakness in communication skills.
Hackers tend to be especially poor at confrontation and negotiation. Because
of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the {Right Thing},
hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted on technical issues, in
marked contrast to their general spirit of camaraderie and tolerance of
alternative viewpoints otherwise. Old-time {{ITS}} partisans look down on the
ever-growing hordes of {{Unix}} and {Linux} hackers; Unix aficionados despise
{VMS} and Windows; and hackers who are used to conventional command-line user
interfaces loudly loathe mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh.
Hackers who don't indulge in {Usenet} consider it a huge waste of time and
{bandwidth}; fans of old adventure games such as {ADVENT} and {Zork} consider
{MUD}s to be glorified chat systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting
puzzles; hackers who are willing to devote endless hours to Usenet or MUDs
consider {IRC} to be a _real_ waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay
if there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way. And, of course, there
are the perennial {holy wars} -- {EMACS} vs. {vi}, {big-endian} vs.
{little-endian}, RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc., etc. As in society at large, the
intensity and duration of these debates is usually inversely proportional to
the number of objective, factual arguments available to buttress any
position. As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships. At worst, they can produce the classic
{geek}: withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually frustrated, and
desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft. Fortunately, this
extreme is far less common than mainstream folklore paints it -- but almost
all hackers will recognize something of themselves in the unflattering
paragraphs above. Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy
about dealing with the physical world. Bills don't get paid on time, clutter
piles up to incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance
tasks get deferred indefinitely. 1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a
syndrome called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), supposedly characterized by
(among other things) a combination of short attention span with an ability to
`hyperfocus' imaginatively on interesting tasks. In 1998-1999 another
syndrome that is said to overlap with many hacker traits entered popular
awareness: Asperger's syndrome (AS). This disorder is also sometimes called
`high-function autism', though researchers are divided on whether AS is in
fact a mild form of autism or a distinct syndrome with a different etiology.
AS patients exhibit mild to severe deficits in interpreting facial and
body-language cues and in modeling or empathizing with others' emotions.
Though some AS patients exhibit mild retardation, others compensate for their
deficits with high intelligence and analytical ability, and frequently seek
out technical fields where problem-solving abilities are at a premium and
people skills are relatively unimportant. Both syndromes are thought to
relate to abnormalities in neurotransmitter chemistry, especially the brain's
processing of serotonin. Many hackers have noticed that mainstream culture
has shown a tendency to pathologize and medicalize normal variations in
personality, especially those variations that make life more complicated for
authority figures and conformists. Thus, hackers aware of the issue tend to
be among those questioning whether ADD and AS actually exist; and if so
whether they are really `diseases' rather than extremes of a normal genetic
variation like having freckles or being able to taste DPT. In either case,
they have a sneaking tendency to wonder if these syndromes are over-diagnosed
and over-treated. After all, people in authority will always be
inconvenienced by schoolchildren or workers or citizens who are prickly,
intelligent individualists - thus, any social system that depends on
authority relationships will tend to helpfully ostracize and therapize and
drug such `abnormal' people until they are properly docile and stupid and
`well-socialized'. So hackers tend to believe they have good reason for
skepticism about clinical explanations of the hacker personality. That being
said, most would also concede that some hacker traits coincide with
indicators for non-hyperactive ADD and AS - the status of caffeeine as a
hacker beverage of choice may be connected to the fact that it bonds to the
same neural receptors as Ritalin, the drug most commonly prescribed for ADD.
It is probably true that boosters of both would find a rather higher rate of
clinical ADD among hackers than the supposedly mainstream-normal 3-5% (AS is
rarer at 0.4-0.5%). :Miscellaneous: =============== Hackers are more likely
to have cats than dogs (in fact, it is widely grokked that cats have the
hacker nature). Many drive incredibly decrepit heaps and forget to wash them;
richer ones drive spiffy Porsches and RX-7s and then forget to have them
washed. Almost all hackers have terribly bad handwriting, and often fall into
the habit of block-printing everything like junior draftsmen. :Helping Hacker
Culture Grow: ***************************** If you enjoyed the Jargon File,
please help the culture that created it grow and flourish. Here are several
ways you can help: * If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write
{hacker} when you mean {cracker}. If you work with writers or journalists,
educate them on this issue and push them to do the right thing. If you catch
a newspaper or magazine abusing the work `hacker', write them and straighten
them out (this appendix includes a model letter). * If you're a techie or
computer hobbyist, get involved with one of the free Unixes. Toss out that
lame Microsoft OS, or confine it to one disk partition and put Linux or
FreeBSD or NetBSD on the other one. And the next time your friend or boss is
thinking about some proprietary software `solution' that costs more than it's
worth, be ready to blow the competition away with open-source software
running over a Unix. * Contribute to organizations like the Free Software
Foundation that promote the production of high-quality free and open-source
software. You can reach the Free Software Foundation at gnu@gnu.org, by phone
at +1-617-542-5942, or by snail-mail at 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,
MA 02111-1307 USA. * Support the League for Programming Freedom, which
opposes over-broad software patents that constantly threaten to blow up in
hackers' faces, preventing them from developing innovative software for
tomorrow's needs. You can reach the League for Programming Freedom at
lpf@uunet.uu.net. by phone at +1 617 621 7084, or by snail-mail at 1 Kendall
Square #143, P.O.Box 9171, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 USA. * Join the
continuing fight against Internet censorship, visit the Center for Democracy
and Technology Home Page at `http://www.cdt.org/'. * If you do nothing else,
please help fight government attempts to seize political control of Internet
content and restrict strong cryptography. The so-called `Communications
Decency Act' was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but U.S.
cryptography policy still infringes our First Amendment rights. Surf to the
Center for Democracy and technology's home page at `http://www.cdt.org/' to
see what you can do to help fight censorship of the net. Here's the text of a
letter RMS wrote to the Wall Street Journal to complain about their policy of
using "hacker" only in a pejorative sense. We hear that most major newspapers
have the same policy. If you'd like to help change this situation, send your
favorite newspaper the same letter - or, better yet, write your own letter.
Dear Editor: This letter is not meant for publication, although you can
publish it if you wish. It is meant specifically for you, the editor, not the
public. I am a hacker. That is to say, I enjoy playing with computers --
working with, learning about, and writing clever computer programs. I am not
a cracker; I don't make a practice of breaking computer security. There's
nothing shameful about the hacking I do. But when I tell people I am a
hacker, people think I'm admitting something naughty -- because newspapers
such as yours misuse the word "hacker", giving the impression that it means
"security breaker" and nothing else. You are giving hackers a bad name. The
saddest thing is that this problem is perpetuated deliberately. Your
reporters know the difference between "hacker" and "security breaker". They
know how to make the distinction, but you don't let them! You insist on using
"hacker" pejoratively. When reporters try to use another word, you change it.
When reporters try to explain the other meanings, you cut it. Of course, you
have a reason. You say that readers have become used to your insulting usage
of "hacker", so that you cannot change it now. Well, you can't undo past
mistakes today; but that is no excuse to repeat them tomorrow. If I were what
you call a "hacker", at this point I would threaten to crack your computer
and crash it. But I am a hacker, not a cracker. I don't do that kind of
thing! I have enough computers to play with at home and at work; I don't need
yours. Besides, it's not my way to respond to insults with violence. My
response is this letter. You owe hackers an apology; but more than that, you
owe us ordinary respect. Sincerely, etc. :Bibliography: ************** Here
are some other books you can read to help you understand the hacker mindset.
:Go"del Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid: Douglas Hofstadter Basic Books,
1979 ISBN 0-394-74502-7 This book reads like an intellectual Grand Tour of
hacker preoccupations. Music, mathematical logic, programming, speculations
on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen are woven into a brilliant
tapestry themed on the concept of encoded self-reference. The perfect
left-brain companion to "Illuminatus". :Illuminatus!: I. "The Eye in the
Pyramid" II. "The Golden Apple" III. "Leviathan". Robert Shea and Robert
Anton Wilson Dell, 1988 ISBN 0-440-53981-1 This work of alleged fiction is an
incredible berserko-surrealist rollercoaster of world-girdling conspiracies,
intelligent dolphins, the fall of Atlantis, who really killed JFK, sex,
drugs, rock'n'roll, and the Cosmic Giggle Factor. First published in three
volumes, but there is now a one-volume trade paperback, carried by most chain
bookstores under SF. The perfect right-brain companion to Hofstadter's
"Go"del, Escher, Bach". see {Eris}, {Discordianism}, {random numbers},
{Church of the SubGenius}. :The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Douglas
Adams Pocket Books, 1981 ISBN 0-671-46149-4 This `Monty Python in Space'
spoof of SF genre traditions has been popular among hackers ever since the
original British radio show. Read it if only to learn about Vogons (see
{bogon}) and the significance of the number 42 (see {random numbers}) -- and
why the winningest chess program of 1990 was called `Deep Thought'. :The Tao
of Programming: James Geoffrey Infobooks, 1987 ISBN 0-931137-07-1 This
gentle, funny spoof of the "Tao Te Ching" contains much that is illuminating
about the hacker way of thought. "When you have learned to snatch the error
code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave." :Hackers: Steven
Levy Anchor/Doubleday 1984 ISBN 0-385-19195-2 Levy's book is at its best in
describing the early MIT hackers at the Model Railroad Club and the early
days of the microcomputer revolution. He never understood Unix or the
networks, though, and his enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true
hacker" turns out (thankfully) to have been quite misleading. Despite being a
bit dated and containing some minor errors (many fixed in the paperback
edition), this remains a useful and stimulating book that captures the feel
of several important hacker subcultures. :The Computer Contradictionary: Stan
Kelly-Bootle MIT Press, 1995 ISBN 0-262-61112-0 This pastiche of Ambrose
Bierce's famous work is similar in format to the Jargon File (and quotes
several entries from TNHD-2) but somewhat different in tone and intent. It is
more satirical and less anthropological, and is largely a product of the
author's literate and quirky imagination. For example, it defines `computer
science' as "a study akin to numerology and astrology, but lacking the
precision of the former and the success of the latter" and `implementation'
as "The fruitless struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill promises
made by the rich and ignorant"; `flowchart' becomes "to obfuscate a problem
with esoteric cartoons". Revised and expanded from "The Devil's DP
Dictionary", McGraw-Hill 1981, ISBN 0-07-034022-6; that work had some
stylistic influence on TNHD-1. :The Devouring Fungus: Tales from the Computer
Age: Karla Jennings Norton, 1990 ISBN 0-393-30732-8 The author of this
pioneering compendium knits together a great deal of computer- and
hacker-related folklore with good writing and a few well-chosen cartoons. She
has a keen eye for the human aspects of the lore and is very good at
illuminating the psychology and evolution of hackerdom. Unfortunately, a
number of small errors and awkwardnesses suggest that she didn't have the
final manuscript checked over by a native speaker; the glossary in the back
is particularly embarrassing, and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch
story, retold here under {A Story About Magic} in Appendix A) is given in
incomplete and badly mangled form. Nevertheless, this book is a win overall
and can be enjoyed by hacker and non-hacker alike. :The Soul of a New
Machine: Tracy Kidder Little, Brown, 1981 (paperback: Avon, 1982 ISBN
0-380-59931-7) This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the
adventure of the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle. It
is an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset -- although largely
the hardware hacker -- done by a complete outsider. It is a bit thin in
spots, but with enough technical information to be entertaining to the
serious hacker while providing non-technical people a view of what day-to-day
life can be like -- the fun, the excitement, the disasters. During one
period, when the microcode and logic were glitching at the nanosecond level,
one of the overworked engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note
on his terminal as his letter of resignation: "I am going to a commune in
Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season." :Life with
UNIX: a Guide for Everyone: Don Libes and Sandy Ressler Prentice-Hall, 1989
ISBN 0-13-536657-7 The authors of this book set out to tell you all the
things about Unix that tutorials and technical books won't. The result is
gossipy, funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable. Along
the way they expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and humor to
qualify as a first-class source for these things. Because so much of today's
hackerdom is involved with Unix, this in turn illuminates many of its
in-jokes and preoccupations. :True Names ... and Other Dangers: Vernor Vinge
Baen Books, 1987 ISBN 0-671-65363-6 Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to
say that the title story of this book "expresses the spirit of hacking best".
Until the subject of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate
another contender. The other stories in this collection are also fine work by
an author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very best
practitioners of hard SF. :Snow Crash: Neal Stephenson Bantam, 1992 ISBN
0-553-56261-4 Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing
about the hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of
fiction has ever even approached. His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of hacking
and its results are astonishing, delightful, and (so far) unsurpassed.
