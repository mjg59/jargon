 :memory leak: n. An error in a program's dynamic-store allocation logic that
causes it to fail to reclaim discarded memory, leading to eventual collapse
due to memory exhaustion. Also (esp. at CMU) called {core leak}. These
problems were severe on older machines with small, fixed-size address spaces,
and special "leak detection" tools were commonly written to root them out.
With the advent of virtual memory, it is unfortunately easier to be sloppy
about wasting a bit of memory (although when you run out of memory on a VM
machine, it means you've got a real leak!). see {aliasing bug}, {fandango on
core}, {smash the stack}, {precedence lossage}, {overrun screw}, {leaky
heap}, {leak}.
