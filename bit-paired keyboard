 :bit-paired keyboard: n.,obs. (alt.: bit-shift keyboard) A non-standard
keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the Teletype ASR-33 and
remained common for several years on early computer equipment. The ASR-33 was
a mechanical device (see {EOU}), so the only way to generate the character
codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage. The design of the ASR-33
assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified by
flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed. In order to avoid
making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design had to
group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one key. Looking
at the ASCII chart, we find: high low bits bits 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101
0110 0111 1000 1001 010 ! " # $ % & ' ( ) 011 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 This is why
the characters !"#$%&'() appear where they do on a Teletype (thankfully, they
didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype Model 33 was actually designed
before ASCII existed, and was originally intended to use a code that
contained these two rows: low bits high 0000 0010 0100 0110 1000 1010 1100
1110 bits 0001 0011 0101 0111 1001 1011 1101 1111 10 ) ! bel # $ % wru & * (
" : ? _ , . 11 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ' ; / - esc del The result would have been
something closer to a normal keyboard. But as it happened, Teletype had to
use a lot of persuasion just to keep ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from
looking like this instead: ! " ? $ ' & - ( ) ; : * / , . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
+ ~ < > Ã— | Teletype's was not the weirdest variant of the {QWERTY} layout
widely seen, by the way; that prize should probably go to one of several
(differing) arrangements on IBM's even clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.
When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there was no
agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out. Some
vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used the
flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like an office
typewriter. Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer keyboard
standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as "logical bit
pairing" and "typewriter pairing". These alternatives became known as
bit-paired and typewriter-paired keyboards. To a hacker, the bit-paired
keyboard seemed far more logical -- and because most hackers in those days
had never learned to touch-type, there was little pressure from the
pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter standard. The doom of
the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction of the computer
terminal into the normal office environment, where out-and-out technophobes
were expected to use the equipment. The typewriter-paired standard became
universal, X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, bit-paired hardware was
quickly junked or relegated to dusty corners, and both terms passed into
disuse. However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As a
result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen etc. still
has all of the !"#$%&'() characters above the numbers in the ASR-33 layout.
