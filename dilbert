 :Dilbert:n. Name and title character of a comic strip nationally syndicated
in the U.S. and enormously popular among hackers. Dilbert is an archetypical
engineer-nerd who works at an anonymous high-technology company; the strips
present a lacerating satire of insane working conditions and idiotic
{management} practices all too readily recognized by hackers. Adams, who
spent nine years in {cube} 4S700R at Pacific Bell (not {DEC} as often
reported), often remarks that he has never been able to come up with a
fictional management blunder that his correspondents didn't quickly either
report to have actually happened or top with a similar but even more bizarre
incident. In 1996 Adams distilled his insights into the collective psychology
of businesses into an even funnier book, "The Dilbert Principle"
(HarperCollins, ISBN 0-887-30787-6). see also {pointy-haired}, {rat dance}.
