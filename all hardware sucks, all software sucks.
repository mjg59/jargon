 :All hardware sucks, all software sucks.: prov. [from {scary devil
monastery}] A general recognition of the fallibility of any computer system,
ritually intoned as an attempt to quell incipient {holy wars}. It is a common
response to any sort of {bigot}. When discussing {Wintel} systems, however,
it is often snidely appended with, `but some suck more than others.'
