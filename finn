 :finn: v. [IRC] To pull rank on somebody based on the amount of time one has
spent on {IRC}. The term derives from the fact that IRC was originally
written in Finland in 1987. There may be some influence from the `Finn'
character in William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk novel "Count Zero", who at
one point says to another (much younger) character "I have a pair of shoes
older than you are, so shut up!"
