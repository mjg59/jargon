 :wiggles: /n./ [scientific computation] In solving partial differential
equations by finite difference and similar methods, wiggles are sawtooth
(up-down-up-down) oscillations at the shortest wavelength representable on
the grid. If an algorithm is unstable, this is often the most unstable
waveform, so it grows to dominate the solution. Alternatively, stable (though
inaccurate) wiggles can be generated near a discontinuity by a Gibbs
phenomenon.
