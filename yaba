 YABA (ya'buh) [Cambridge University] n. Yet Another Bloody Acronym. Whenever
some program is being named, someone invariably suggests that it be given a
name which is acronymic. The response from those with a trace of originality
is to remark ironically that the proposed name would then be
"YABA-compatible". Also used in response to questions like "What is WYSIWYG?"
"YABA." see also TLA.
