 :YABA: /ya'b*/ [Cambridge] n. Yet Another Bloody Acronym. Whenever some
program is being named, someone invariably suggests that it be given a name
that is acronymic. The response from those with a trace of originality is to
remark ironically that the proposed name would then be `YABA-compatible'.
Also used in response to questions like "What is WYSIWYG?" see also {TLA}.
