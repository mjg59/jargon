 BUM 1. vt. To make highly efficient, either in time or space, often at the
expense of clarity. "I managed to bum three more instructions out of that
code." 2. n. A small change to an algorithm, program, or hardware device to
make it more efficient. "This hardware bum makes the jump instruction
faster." Usage: now uncommon, largely superseded by TUNE (q.v.). Note that
both these uses are rare in Commonwealth English, where "bum" is interpreted
as a rude synonym for "buttocks".
