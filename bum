 :bum: 1. vt. To make highly efficient, either in time or space, often at the
expense of clarity. "I managed to bum three more instructions out of that
code." "I spent half the night bumming the interrupt code." In {elder days},
John McCarthy (inventor of {LISP}) used to compare some efficiency-obsessed
hackers among his students to "ski bums"; thus, optimization became "program
bumming", and eventually just "bumming". 2. To squeeze out excess; to remove
something in order to improve whatever it was removed from (without changing
function; this distinguishes the process from a {featurectomy}). 3. n. A
small change to an algorithm, program, or hardware device to make it more
efficient. "This hardware bum makes the jump instruction faster." Usage: now
uncommon, largely superseded by v. {tune} (and n. {tweak}, {hack}), though
none of these exactly capture sense 2. All these uses are rare in
Commonwealth hackish, because in the parent dialects of English `bum' is a
rude synonym for `buttocks'.
