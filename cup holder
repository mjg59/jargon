 :cup holder: n. The tray of a CD-ROM drive, or by extension the CD drive
itself. So called because of a common tech support legend about the idiot who
called to complain that the cup holder on his computer broke. A joke program
was once distributed around the net called "cupholder.exe", which when run
simply extended the CD drive tray. The humor of this was of course lost on
people whose drive had a slot or a caddy instead.
