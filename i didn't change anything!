 :I didn't change anything!: /interj./ An aggrieved cry often heard as bugs
manifest during a regression test. The {canonical} reply to this assertion is
"Then it works just the same as it did before, doesn't it?" see also
{one-line fix}. This is also heard from applications programmers trying to
blame an obvious applications problem on an unrelated systems software
change, for example a divide-by-0 fault after terminals were added to a
network. Usually, their statement is found to be false. Upon close
questioning, they will admit some major restructuring of the program that
shouldn't have broken anything, in their opinion, but which actually {hosed}
the code completely.
