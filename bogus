 BOGUS (WPI, Yale, Stanford) adj. 1. Non-functional. "Your patches are
bogus." 2. Useless. "OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your arguments are
bogus." 4. Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Silly. "Stop writing
those bogus sagas." (This word seems to have some, but not all, of the
connotations of RANDOM.) [Etymological note from Lehman/Reid at CMU: "Bogus"
was originally used (in this sense) at Princeton, in the late 60's. It was
used not particularly in the CS department, but all over campus. It came to
Yale, where one of us (Lehman) was an undergraduate, and (we assume)
elsewhere through the efforts of Princeton alumni who brought the word with
them from their alma mater. In the Yale case, the alumnus is Michael Shamos,
who was a graduate student at Yale and is now a faculty member here. A
glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was first
popularized (e.g., autobogophobia: the fear of becoming bogotified).]
