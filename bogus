 :bogus: /adj./ 1. Non-functional. "Your patches are bogus." 2. Useless.
"OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your arguments are bogus." 4.
Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Unbelievable. "You claim to have
solved the halting problem for Turing Machines? That's totally bogus." 6.
Silly. "Stop writing those bogus sagas." Astrology is bogus. So is a bolt
that is obviously about to break. So is someone who makes blatantly false
claims to have solved a scientific problem. (This word seems to have some,
but not all, of the connotations of {random} -- mostly the negative ones.) It
is claimed that `bogus' was originally used in the hackish sense at Princeton
in the late 1960s. It was spread to CMU and Yale by Michael Shamos, a
migratory Princeton alumnus. A glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale
when the word was first popularized (see {autobogotiphobia} under
{bogotify}). The word spread into hackerdom from CMU and MIT. By the early
1980s it was also current in something like the hackish sense in West Coast
teen slang, and it had gone mainstream by 1985. A correspondent from
Cambridge reports, by contrast, that these uses of `bogus' grate on British
nerves; in Britain the word means, rather specifically, `counterfeit', as in
"a bogus 10-pound note".
