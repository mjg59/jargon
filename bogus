 BOGUS [WPI, Yale, Stanford] adj. 1. Non-functional. "Your patches are
bogus." 2. Useless. "OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your arguments are
bogus." 4. Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Unbelievable. "You claim
to have solved the halting problem for Turing Machines? That's totally
bogus." 6. Silly. "Stop writing those bogus sagas." Astrology is bogus. So is
a bolt that is obviously about to break. So is someone who makes blatantly
false claims to have solved a scientific problem. (This word seems to have
some, but not all, of the connotations of RANDOM.) [Etymological note:
"Bogus" was originally used in the hackish sense at Princeton, in the late
60s. It was used not particularly in the CS department, but all over campus.
It came to Yale, where one of us (Lehman) was an undergraduate, and (we
assume) elsewhere through the efforts of Princeton alumni who brought the
word with them from their alma mater. In the Yale case, the alumnus is
Michael Shamos, who was a graduate student at Yale and is now a faculty
member here. A glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was
first popularized (see AUTOBOGOTIPHOBIA under BOGOTIFY). By the mid-1980s it
was also current in something like the hackish sense in West Coast teen
slang] Further note: A correspondent at Cambridge claims these uses of bogus
grate on British nerves; in Britain the word means rather specifically
`counterfeit' as in "a bogus pound note".
