 :glitch: /glich/ [from German `glitschen' to slip, via Yiddish `glitshen',
to slide or skid] 1. n. A sudden interruption in electric service, sanity,
continuity, or program function. Sometimes recoverable. An interruption in
electric service is specifically called a `power glitch' (also {power hit}),
of grave concern because it usually crashes all the computers. In jargon,
though, a hacker who got to the middle of a sentence and then forgot how he
or she intended to complete it might say, "Sorry, I just glitched". 2. vi. To
commit a glitch. see {gritch}. 3. vt. [Stanford] To scroll a display screen,
esp. several lines at a time. {{WAITS}} terminals used to do this in order to
avoid continuous scrolling, which is distracting to the eye. 4. obs. Same as
{magic cookie}, sense 2. All these uses of `glitch' derive from the specific
technical meaning the term has in the electronic hardware world, where it is
now techspeak. A glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit change, and
the outputs change to some {random} value for some very brief time before
they settle down to the correct value. If another circuit inspects the output
at just the wrong time, reading the random value, the results can be very
wrong and very hard to debug (a glitch is one of many causes of electronic
{heisenbug}s).
