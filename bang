 BANG 1. n. Common spoken name for `!' (ASCII 33), especially when used in
pronouncing a BANG PATH (q.v.) in spoken hackish. In elder days this was
considered a CMUish usage, with MIT and Stanford hackers preferring EXCL or
SHRIEK; but the spread of UNIX has carried BANG with it (esp. via the term
BANG PATH) and it is now certainly the most common spoken name for `!'. Note
that it is used exclusively for non-emphatic written `!'; one would not say
"Congratulations bang.", but if one wanted to specify the exact characters
"FOO!", one would speak "Eff oh oh bang". see SHRIEK, ASCII. 2. interj. An
exclamation signifying roughly "I have achieved enlightenment!" or "The
dynamite has cleared out my brain!". Often used to acknowledge that one has
perpetrated a THINKO immediately after one has been called on it.
