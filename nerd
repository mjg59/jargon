 :nerd: n. 1. [mainstream slang] Pejorative applied to anyone with an
above-average IQ and few gifts at small talk and ordinary social rituals. 2.
[jargon] Term of praise applied (in conscious ironic reference to sense 1) to
someone who knows what's really important and interesting and doesn't care to
be distracted by trivial chatter and silly status games. Compare {geek}. The
word itself appears to derive from the lines "And then, just to show them,
I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a Proo, / A
Nerkle, a Nerd, and a seersucker, too!" in the Dr. Seuss book "If I Ran the
Zoo" (1950). (The spellings `nurd' and `gnurd' also used to be current at
MIT, where `nurd' is reported from as far back as 1957.) How it developed its
mainstream meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to have entered mass culture
in the early 1970s (there are reports that in the mid-1960s it meant roughly
"annoying misfit" without the connotation of intelligence). An IEEE Spectrum
article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd' in its variant form `knurd' from
the word `drunk' backwards, but this bears all the hallmarks of a bogus folk
etymology. Apparently this etymology was folklore at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute around 1979. Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten
years later, and some actually wear "Nerd Pride" buttons, only half as a
joke. At MIT one can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket protectors
bearing the slogan and the MIT seal.
