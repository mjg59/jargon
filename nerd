 :nerd: /n./ 1. [mainstream slang] Pejorative applied to anyone with an
above-average IQ and few gifts at small talk and ordinary social rituals. 2.
[jargon] Term of praise applied (in conscious ironic reference to sense 1) to
someone who knows what's really important and interesting and doesn't care to
be distracted by trivial chatter and silly status games. Compare the two
senses of {computer geek}. The word itself appears to derive from the line
"And then, just to show them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo And Bring Back an
It-Kutch, a Preep and a Proo, a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a seersucker, too!" in
the Dr. Seuss book "If I Ran the Zoo" (1950). (The spellings `nurd' and
`gnurd' also used to be current at MIT.) How it developed its mainstream
meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to have entered mass culture in the
early 1970s (there are reports that in the mid-1960s it meant roughly
"annoying misfit" without the connotation of intelligence). An IEEE Spectrum
article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd' in its variant form `knurd' from
the word `drunk' backwards, but this bears all the earmarks of a bogus folk
etymology. Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later,
and some actually wear "Nerd Pride" buttons, only half as a joke.
