 :propeller head: /n./ Used by hackers, this is syn. with {computer geek}.
Non-hackers sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob. derives from SF
fandom's tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray Faraday Nelson)
of propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody actually wears them
except as a joke).
