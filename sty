 STY (pronounced "stie", not spelled out) n. A pseudo-teletype, which is a
two-way pipeline with a job on one end and a fake keyboard-tty on the other.
Also, a standard program which provides a pipeline from its controlling tty
to a pseudo-teletype (and thence to another tty, thereby providing a
"sub-tty"). This is MIT terminology; the SAIL, DEC and UNIX equivalent is PTY
(see main text).
