 STY (pronounced "sty," not spelled out) n. A pseudo- teletype, which is a
two-way pipeline with a job on one end and a fake keyboard-tty on the other.
Also, a stan- dard program which provides a pipeline from its control- ling
tty to a pseudo-teletype (and thence to another tty, thereby providing a
"sub-tty"). This is MIT termi- nology; the SAIL and DEC equivalent is PTY.
