 SOFTWARE ROT (soft'weir raht) n. Hypothetical disease the existence of which
has been deduced from the observation that unused programs or features will
stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if "nothing has changed".
Also known as BIT DECAY, BIT ROT. Occasionally this turns out to be a real
problem due to media failure.
