 SOFTWARE ROT n. (Also known as BIT DECAY, BIT ROT) Hypothetical disease the
existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs
or features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if
"nothing has changed". The theory explains that bits decay as if they were
radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a program
will become increasingly garbled. There actually are physical processes that
produce such effects (the alpha particles such as are found in cosmic rays
can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and various kinds
of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass storage) but they are
quite rare. Nevertheless, when you can't figure out why something stopped
working, it is often humorously convenient to blame SOFTWARE ROT. Historical
note: software rot in an even funnier sense than the mythical one was a real
problem on early research computers (e. g. the R1, see GRIND CRANK). If a
program that depended on a peculiar instuction hadn't been run in quite a
while, the user might discover that the opcodes no longer did the things as
they used to. ("Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such. We
can snarf this one, right? No one uses it.")
