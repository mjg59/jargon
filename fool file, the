 :fool file, the: [USENET] n. A notional repository of all the most
dramatically and abysmally stupid utterances ever. An entire subgenre of {sig
block}s consists of the header "From the fool file:" followed by some quote
the poster wishes to represent as an immortal gem of dimwittery; for this
usage to be really effective, the quote has to be so obviously wrong as to be
laughable. More than one USENETter has achieved an unwanted notoriety by
being quoted in this way.
