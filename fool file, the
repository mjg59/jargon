 :fool file, the: [USENET] n. A notional repository of all the most
dramatically and abysmally stupid utterances ever. There is a subgenre of
{sig block}s that consists of the header "From the fool file:" followed by
some quote the poster wishes to represent as an immortal gem of dimwittery;
for this to be really effective, the quote has to be so obviously wrong as to
be laughable. More than one USENETter has achieved an unwanted notoriety by
being quoted in this way.
