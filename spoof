 :spoof: vi. To capture, alter, and retransmit a communication stream in a
way that misleads the recipient. As used by hackers, refers especially to
altering TCP/IP packet source addresses or other packet-header data in order
to masquerade as a trusted machine. This term has become very widespread and
is borderline techspeak. Interestingly, it was already in use in its modern
sense more than a century ago among Victorian teklegraphers; it shows up in
Kipling.
