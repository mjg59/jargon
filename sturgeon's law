 :Sturgeon's Law: prov. "Ninety percent of everything is crud". Derived from
a quote by science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, who once said, "Sure,
90% of science fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud."
Sturgeon himself called this "Sturgeon's Revelation", and it first appeared
in the March 1958 issue of Venture Science Fiction; he gave Sturgeon's Law as
"Nothing is always absolutely so." Oddly, when Sturgeon's Revelation is
cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to `crap'. Compare
{Hanlon's Razor}, {Ninety-Ninety Rule}. Though this maxim originated in SF
fandom, most hackers recognize it and are all too aware of its truth.
