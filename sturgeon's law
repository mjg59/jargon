 :Sturgeon's Law: prov. "Ninety percent of everything is crap". Derived from
a quote by science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon, who once said, "Sure,
90% of science fiction is crud. That's because 90% of everything is crud."
Oddly, when Sturgeon's Law is cited, the final word is almost invariably
changed to `crap'. Compare {Hanlon's Razor}, {Ninety-Ninety Rule}. Though
this maxim originated in SF fandom, most hackers recognize it and are all too
aware of its truth.
