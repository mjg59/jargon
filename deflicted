 :deflicted: [portmanteau of "defective" and "afflicted"; common among PC
repair technicians, and probably originated among hardware techs outside the
hacker community proper] Term used of hardware that is broken due to poor
design or shoddy manufacturing or (especially) both; less frequently used of
software and rarely of people. This term is normally employed in a tone of
weary contempt by technicians who have seen the specific failure in the
trouble report before and are cynically confident they'll see it again.
