 :deflicted: [portmanteau of "defective" and "afflicted"; common among PC
repair technicians, and probably originated among hardware techs outside the
hacker community proper] Term used of hardware that is broken due to poor
design or shoddy manufacturing or (especially) both; less frequently used of
software and rarely of people. This term is normally employed in a tone of
weary contempt by technicians who have seen the specific failure in the
trouble report before and are cynically confident they'll see it again.
Ultimately this may derive from Frank Zappa's 1974 album "Apostrophe", on
which the Fur Trapper infamously rubs his deflicted eyes...
