 :gritch: /grich/ [MIT] 1. n. A complaint (often caused by a {glitch}). 2.
vi. To complain. Often verb-doubled: "Gritch gritch". 3. A synonym for
{glitch} (as verb or noun). Interestingly, this word seems to have a separate
history from {glitch}, with which it is often confused. Back in the early
1960s, when `glitch' was strictly a hardware-tech's term of art, the Burton
House dorm at M.I.T. maintained a "Gritch Book", a blank volume, into which
the residents hand-wrote complaints, suggestions, and witticisms. Previous
years' volumes of this tradition were maintained, dating back to antiquity.
The word "gritch" was described as a portmanteau of "gripe" and "bitch".
Thus, sense 3 above is at least historically incorrect.
