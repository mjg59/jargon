 :CP/M:: /C-P-M/ n. [Control Program for Microcomputers] An early
microcomputer {OS} written by hacker Gary Kildall for 8080- and Z80-based
machines, very popular in the late 1970s but virtually wiped out by MS-DOS
after the release of the IBM PC in 1981. Legend has it that Kildall's company
blew its chance to write the OS for the IBM PC because Kildall decided to
spend a day IBM's reps wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying
weather in his private plane. Many of CP/M's features and conventions
strongly resemble those of early DEC operating systems such as {{TOPS-10}},
OS/8, RSTS, and RSX-11. see {{MS-DOS}}, {operating system}.
