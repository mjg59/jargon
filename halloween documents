 :Halloween Documents: n. A pair of Microsoft internal strategy memoranda
leaked to ESR in late 1998 that confirmed everybody's paranoia about the
current {Evil Empire}. These documents praised the technical excellence of
{Linux} and outlined a counterstrategy of attempting to lock in customers by
"de-commoditizing" Internet protocols and services. They were extensively
cited on the Internet and in the press and proved so embarrassing that
Microsoft PR barely said a word in public for six months afterwards.
