 :dumpster diving: /dump'·ster di:´·ving/, n. 1. The practice of sifting
refuse from an office or technical installation to extract confidential data,
especially security-compromising information (`dumpster' is an Americanism
for what is elsewhere called a skip). Back in AT&T's monopoly days, before
paper shredders became common office equipment, phone phreaks (see
{phreaking}) used to organize regular dumpster runs against phone company
plants and offices. Discarded and damaged copies of AT&T internal manuals
taught them much. The technique is still rumored to be a favorite of crackers
operating against careless targets. 2. The practice of raiding the dumpsters
behind buildings where producers and/or consumers of high-tech equipment are
located, with the expectation (usually justified) of finding discarded but
still-valuable equipment to be nursed back to health in some hacker's den.
Experienced dumpster-divers not infrequently accumulate basements full of
moldering (but still potentially useful) {cruft}.
