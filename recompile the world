 :recompile the world: The surprisingly large amount of work that needs to be
done as the result of any small but globally visible program change. "The
world" may mean the entirety of some huge program, or may in theory refer to
every program of a certain class in the entire known universe. For instance,
"Add one #define to stdio.h, and you have to recompile the world." This means
that any minor change to the standard-I/O header file theoretically mandates
recompiling every C program in existence, even if only to verify that the
change didn't screw something else up. In practice, you may not actually have
to recompile the world, but the implication is that some human cleverness is
required to figure out what parts can be safely left out.
