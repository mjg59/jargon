 :cat: [from `catenate' via {{Unix}} `cat(1)'] vt. 1. [techspeak] To spew an
entire file to the screen or some other output sink without pause (syn.
{blast}). 2. By extension, to dump large amounts of data at an unprepared
target or with no intention of browsing it carefully. Usage: considered
silly. Rare outside Unix sites. see also {dd}, {BLT}. Among Unix fans,
`cat(1)' is considered an excellent example of user-interface design, because
it delivers the file contents without such verbosity as spacing or headers
between the files, and because it does not require the files to consist of
lines of text, but works with any sort of data. Among Unix haters, `cat(1)'
is considered the {canonical} example of _bad_ user-interface design, because
of its woefully unobvious name. It is far more often used to {blast} a file
to standard output than to concatenate two files. The name `cat' for the
former operation is just as unintuitive as, say, LISP's {cdr}. Of such
oppositions are {holy wars} made.... see also {UUOC}.
