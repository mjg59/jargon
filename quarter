 :quarter: n. Two bits. This in turn comes from the `pieces of eight' famed
in pirate movies --- Spanish silver crowns that could be broken into eight
pie-slice-shaped `bits' to make change. Early in American history the Spanish
coin was considered equal to a dollar, so each of these `bits' was considered
worth 12.5 cents. Syn. {tayste}, {crumb}, {quad}. Usage: rare. see also
{nickle}, {nybble}, {{byte}}, {dynner}.
