 :bot: n [common on IRC, MUD and among gamers; from "robot"] 1. An {IRC} or
{MUD} user who is actually a program. On IRC, typically the robot provides
some useful service. Examples are NickServ, which tries to prevent random
users from adopting {nick}s already claimed by others, and MsgServ, which
allows one to send asynchronous messages to be delivered when the recipient
signs on. Also common are `annoybots', such as KissServ, which perform no
useful function except to send cute messages to other people. Service bots
are less common on MUDs; but some others, such as the `Julia' bot active in
1990--91, have been remarkably impressive Turing-test experiments, able to
pass as human for as long as ten or fifteen minutes of conversation. 2. An
AI-controlled player in a computer game (especially a first-person shooter
such as Quake) which, unlike ordinary monsters, operates like a
human-controlled player, with access to a player's weapons and abilities. An
example can be found at http://www.telefragged.com/thefatal/. 3. Term used,
though less commonly, for a web {spider}. The file for controlling spider
behavior on your site is officially the "Robots Exclusion File" and its URL
is "http://<somehost>/robots.txt") Note that bots in all senses were `robots'
when the terms first appeared in the early 1990s, but the shortened form is
now habitual.
