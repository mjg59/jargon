 :display hack: n. A program with the same approximate purpose as a
kaleidoscope: to make pretty pictures. Famous display hacks include {munching
squares}, {smoking clover}, the BSD Unix rain(6) program, worms(6) on
miscellaneous Unixes, and the {X} kaleid(1) program. Display hacks can also
be implemented by creating text files containing numerous escape sequences
for interpretation by a video terminal; one notable example displayed, on any
VT100, a Christmas tree with twinkling lights and a toy train circling its
base. The {hack value} of a display hack is proportional to the esthetic
value of the images times the cleverness of the algorithm divided by the size
of the code. Syn. {psychedelicware}.
