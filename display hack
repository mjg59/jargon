 DISPLAY HACK n. A program with the same approximate purpose as a
kaleidoscope: to make pretty pictures. Famous display hacks include MUNCHING
SQUARES, SMOKING CLOVER, the BSD UNIX rain(6) program, worms(6) on
miscellaneous UNIXes, and the X kaleid program. Display hacks can also be
implemented without programming by creating text files containing numerous
escape sequences for interpretation by a video terminal; one notable example
displayed, on any VT100, a christmas tree with twinkling lights and a toy
train circling its base.
