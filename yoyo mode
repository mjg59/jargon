 :yoyo mode: n. The state in which the system is said to be when it rapidly
alternates several times between being up and being down. Interestingly (and
perhaps not by coincidence), many hardware vendors give out free yoyos at
Usenix exhibits. Sun Microsystems gave out logoized yoyos at SIGPLAN '88.
Tourists staying at one of Atlanta's most respectable hotels were
subsequently treated to the sight of 200 of the country's top computer
scientists testing yo-yo algorithms in the lobby.
