 CAN vt. To abort a job on a time-sharing system. Used esp. when the person
doing the deed is an operator, as in CANNED FROM THE CONSOLE. Frequently used
in an imperative sense, as in "Can that print job, the LPT just popped a
sprocket!". Synonymous with GUN. It is said that the ASCII character with
mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a kill-job character on some early OSs.
