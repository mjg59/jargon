 :cut a tape: /vi./ To write a software or document distribution on magnetic
tape for shipment. Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium!
Early versions of this lexicon claimed that one never analogously speaks of
`cutting a disk', but this has since been reported as live usage. Related
slang usages are mainstream business's `cut a check', the recording
industry's `cut a record', and the military's `cut an order'. All of these
usages reflect physical processes in obsolete recording and duplication
technologies. The first stage in manufacturing an old-style vinyl record
involved cutting grooves in a stamping die with a precision lathe. More
mundanely, the dominant technology for mass duplication of paper documents in
pre-photocopying days involved "cutting a stencil", punching away portions of
the wax overlay on a silk screen. More directly, paper tape with holes
punched in it was an important early storage medium.
