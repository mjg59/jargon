 :UUCPNET: /n. obs./ The store-and-forward network consisting of all the
world's connected Unix machines (and others running some clone of the UUCP
(Unix-to-Unix CoPy) software). Any machine reachable only via a {bang path}
is on UUCPNET. This term has been rendered obsolescent by the spread of cheap
Internet connections in the 1990s; the few remaining UUCP links are
essentially slow channels to the Internet rather than an autonomous network.
