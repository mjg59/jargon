 :SEX: /seks/ [Sun Users' Group & elsewhere] /n./ 1. Software EXchange. A
technique invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of millions of years ago
to speed up their evolution, which had been terribly slow up until then.
Today, SEX parties are popular among hackers and others (of course, these are
no longer limited to exchanges of genetic software). In general, SEX parties
are a {Good Thing}, but unprotected SEX can propagate a {virus}. see also
{pubic directory}. 2. The rather Freudian mnemonic often used for Sign
EXtend, a machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other
architectures. The RCA 1802 chip used in the early Elf and SuperElf personal
computers had a `SEt X register' SEX instruction, but this seems to have had
little folkloric impact. DEC's engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that
used the `SEX' mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once) marketing
wasn't asleep and forced a change. That wasn't the last time this happened,
either. The author of "The Intel 8086 Primer", who was one of the original
designers of the 8086, noted that there was originally a `SEX' instruction on
that processor, too. He says that Intel management got cold feet and decreed
that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed `CBW' and `CWD'
(depending on what was being extended). Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the
microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight `SEX' but
has logical-or and logical-and instructions `ORL' and `ANL'. The Motorola
6809, used in the U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal computer, actually had an
official `SEX' instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it competed
did not. British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all,
it was commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex with
a dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.
