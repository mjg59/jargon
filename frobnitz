 FROBNITZ, pl. FROBNITZEM (frob'nitsm) n. An unspecified phy- sical object, a
widget. Also refers to electronic black boxes. This rare form is usually
abbreviated to FROTZ, or more commonly to FROB. Also used are FROBNULE, FRO-
BULE, and FROBNODULE. Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBBOZ (fruh-bahz'), pl.
FROBBOTZIM, has also become very popu- lar, largely due to its exposure via
the Adventure spin-off called Zork (Dungeon). These can also be applied to
non-physical objects, such as data struc- tures.
