 FROBNITZ /frob'nits/, pl. FROBNITZEM (frob'nitsm) n. An unspecified physical
object, a widget. Also refers to electronic black boxes. This rare form is
usually abbreviated to FROTZ, or more commonly to FROB. Also used are
FROBNULE and FROBULE. Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBOZZ (fruh-bahz'), plural
FROBBOTZIM (fruh-bot'z@m) has also become very popular, largely due to its
exposure as a name via ZORK. These can also be applied to nonphysical
objects, such as data structures.
