 FROBNITZ, pl. FROBNITZEM (frob'nitsm) n. An unspecified physical object, a
widget. Also refers to electronic black boxes. This rare form is usually
abbreviated to FROTZ, or more commonly to FROB. Also used are FROBNULE,
FROBULE, and FROBNODULE. Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBBOZ (fruh-bahz'), pl.
FROBBOTZIM, has also become very popular, largely due to its exposure via the
Adventure spin-off called Zork (Dungeon). These can also be applied to
non-physical objects, such as data structures.
