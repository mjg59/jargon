 :frobnitz: /frob'nits/, pl. `frobnitzem' /frob'nit-zm/ or `frobni'
/frob'ni:/ n. [TMRC] An unspecified physical object, a widget. Also refers to
electronic black boxes. This rare form is usually abbreviated to `frotz', or
more commonly to {frob}. Also used are `frobnule' (/frob'n[y]ool/) and
`frobule' (/frob'yool/). Starting perhaps in 1979, `frobozz' /fr*-boz'/
(plural: `frobbotzim' /fr*-bot'zm/) has also become very popular, largely
through its exposure as a name via {Zork}. These variants can also be applied
to nonphysical objects, such as data structures. Pete Samson, compiler of the
original {TMRC} lexicon, adds, "Under the TMRC [railroad] layout were many
storage boxes, managed (in 1958) by David R. Sawyer. Several had fanciful
designations written on them, such as `Frobnitz Coil Oil'. Perhaps DRS
intended Frobnitz to be a proper name, but the name was quickly taken for the
thing". This was almost certainly the origin of the term.
