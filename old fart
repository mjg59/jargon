 :old fart: n. Tribal elder. A title self-assumed with remarkable frequency
by (esp.) Usenetters who have been programming for more than about 25 years;
often appears in {sig block}s attached to Jargon File contributions of great
archeological significance. This is a term of insult in the second or third
