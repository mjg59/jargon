 OLD FART n. Tribal elder. A title self-assumed with remarkable frequency by
(esp.) USENETters who have been programming for more than about twenty five
years; frequently appears in SIGs attached to jargon file contributions of
great archeological significance. This is a term of insult in second or third
person but pride in first person.
