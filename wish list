 :wish list: n. A list of desired features or bug fixes that probably won't
get done for a long time, usually because the person responsible for the code
is too busy or can't think of a clean way to do it. "OK, I'll add automatic
filename completion to the wish list for the new interface." Compare
{tick-list features}.
