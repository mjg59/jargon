 :thread: n. [Usenet, GEnie, CompuServe] Common abbreviation of `topic
thread', a more or less continuous chain of postings on a single topic. To
`follow a thread' is to read a series of Usenet postings sharing a common
subject or (more correctly) which are connected by Reference headers. The
better newsreaders can present news in thread order automatically.
Interestingly, this is far from a neologism. The OED says: "That which
connects the successive points in anything, esp. a narrative, train of
thought, or the like; the sequence of events or ideas continuing throughout
the whole course of anything;" Citations are given going back to 1642!
