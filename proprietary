 :proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies a product
imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the company's own
hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and users,
inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards, and
thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely
on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer
in. Often used in the phrase "proprietary crap". 3. Synonym for
closed-source, e.g. software issued in binary without source and under a
restrictive license. Since the coining of the term {open source}, many
hackers have made a conscious effort to distinguish between `proprietary' and
`commercial' software. It is possible for software to be commercial (that is,
intended to make a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The
reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only freeware.
