 :proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies a product
imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the company's own
hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and users,
inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards, and
thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely
on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer
in. Often used in the phrase "proprietary crap". 3. Synonym for closed-source
or non-free, e.g. software issued without license rights permitting the
public to independently review, develop and redistribute it. Proprietary
software should be distinguished from commercial software. It is possible for
software to be commercial (that is, intended to make a profit for the
producers) without being proprietary. It is possible for software to be
commercial (that is, intended to make a profit for the producers) without
being proprietary. The reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only
freeware.
