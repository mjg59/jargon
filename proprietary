 :proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies a product
imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the company's
hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and users,
inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards, and
thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely
on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer
in (that's assuming it wasn't too expensive in the first place).
