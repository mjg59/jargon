 ALIASING BUG [C programmers] n. A class of subtle programming errors which
can arise in code that does dynamic allocation via malloc(3). If more than
one pointer addresses (`aliases for') a given hunk of storage, it may happen
that the storage is freed through one alias and then referenced through
another, leading to subtle (and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on
the state and the allocation history of the malloc ARENA. Avoidable by use of
allocation strategies that never alias allocated core. Also called a STALE
POINTER BUG. see also PRECEDENCE LOSSAGE, SMASH THE STACK, FANDANGO ON CORE,
