 SCRIBBLE (skri'bl) n. To modify a data structure in a random and
unintentionally destructive way. "Bletch! Somebody's disk-compactor program
went berserk and scribbled on the i-node table." "It was working fine until
one of the allocation routines scribbled on low core." Synonymous with TRASH;
compare MUNG, which conveys a bit more intention, and MANGLE, which is more
violent and final.
