 :scribble: /n./ To modify a data structure in a random and unintentionally
destructive way. "Bletch! Somebody's disk-compactor program went berserk and
scribbled on the i-node table." "It was working fine until one of the
allocation routines scribbled on low core." Synonymous with {trash}; compare
{mung}, which conveys a bit more intention, and {mangle}, which is more
violent and final.
