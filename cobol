 :COBOL: /koh'bol/ [COmmon Business-Oriented Language] n. (Synonymous with
{evil}.) A weak, verbose, and flabby language used by {card walloper}s to do
boring mindless things on {dinosaur} mainframes. Hackers believe that all
COBOL programmers are {suit}s or {code grinder}s, and no self-respecting
hacker will ever admit to having learned the language. Its very name is
seldom uttered without ritual expressions of disgust or horror. see also
{fear and loathing}, {software rot}.
