 :COBOL: /koh'bol/ n. [COmmon Business-Oriented Language] (Synonymous with
{evil}.) A weak, verbose, and flabby language used by {card walloper}s to do
boring mindless things on {dinosaur} mainframes. Hackers believe that all
COBOL programmers are {suit}s or {code grinder}s, and no self-respecting
hacker will ever admit to having learned the language. Its very name is
seldom uttered without ritual expressions of disgust or horror. One popular
one is Edsger W. Dijkstra's famous observation that "The use of COBOL
cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal
offense." (from "Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective") see
also {fear and loathing}, {software rot}.
