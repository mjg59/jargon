 :pencil and paper: n. An archaic information storage and transmission device
that works by depositing smears of graphite on bleached wood pulp. More
recent developments in paper-based technology include improved `write-once'
update devices which use tiny rolling heads similar to mouse balls to deposit
colored pigment. All these devices require an operator skilled at so-called
`handwriting' technique. These technologies are ubiquitous outside hackerdom,
but nearly forgotten inside it. Most hackers had terrible handwriting to
begin with, and years of keyboarding tend to have encouraged it to degrade
further. Perhaps for this reason, hackers deprecate pencil-and-paper
technology and often resist using it in any but the most trivial contexts.
