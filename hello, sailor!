 :hello, sailor!: interj. Occasional West Coast equivalent of {hello, world};
seems to have originated at SAIL, later associated with the game {Zork}
(which also included "hello, aviator" and "hello, implementor"). Originally
from the traditional hooker's greeting to a swabbie fresh off the boat, of
course.
