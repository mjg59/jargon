 :path: n. 1. A {bang path} or explicitly routed Internet address; a
node-by-node specification of a link between two machines. Though these are
now obsolete as a form of addressing, they still show up in diagnostics and
trace headers occasionally (e.g. in NNTP headers). 2. [Unix] A filename,
fully specified relative to the root directory (as opposed to relative to the
current directory; the latter is sometimes called a relative path). This is
also called a pathname. 3. [Unix and MS-DOS/Windows] The search path, an
environment variable specifying the directories in which the {shell}
(COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar
constructs abound under Unix (for example, the C preprocessor has a search
path it uses in looking for #include files).
