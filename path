 :path: n. 1. A {bang path} or explicitly routed {{Internet address}}; a
node-by-node specification of a link between two machines. 2. [UNIX] A
filename, fully specified relative to the root directory (as opposed to
relative to the current directory; the latter is sometimes called a `relative
path'). This is also called a `pathname'. 3. [UNIX and MS-DOS] The `search
path', an environment variable specifying the directories in which the
{shell} (COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS) should look for commands. Other, similar
constructs abound under UNIX (for example, the C preprocessor has a `search
path' it uses in looking for `#include' files).
