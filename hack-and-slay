 :hack-and-slay: v. (also `hack-and-slash') 1. To play a {MUD} or go mudding,
especially with the intention of {berserking} for pleasure. 2. To undertake
an all-night programming/hacking session, interspersed with stints of mudding
as a change of pace. This term arose on the British academic network amongst
students who worked nights and logged onto Essex University's MUDs during
public-access hours (2 A.M. to 7 A.M.). Usually more mudding than work was
done in these sessions.
