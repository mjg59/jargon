 :go flatline: v. [from cyberpunk SF, refers to flattening of EEG traces upon
brain-death] (also adjectival flatlined). 1. To {die}, terminate, or fail,
esp. irreversibly. In hacker parlance, this is used of machines only, human
death being considered somewhat too serious a matter to employ jargon-jokes
about. 2. To go completely quiescent; said of machines undergoing controlled
shutdown. "You can suffer file damage if you shut down Unix but power off
before the system has gone flatline." 3. Of a video tube, to fail by losing
vertical scan, so all one sees is a bright horizontal line bisecting the
screen.
