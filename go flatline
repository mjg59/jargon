 GO FLATLINE [from cyberpunk SF, refers to flattening of EEG traces upon
brain-death] v., also adjectival FLATLINED. 1. To die, terminate, or fail,
esp. irreversibly. In hacker parlance this is used of machines only, human
death being considered somewhat too serious a matter to employ jargon-jokes
about. 2. To go completely quiescent; said of machines undergoing controlled
shutdown. "You can suffer file damage if you shut down UNIX but power off
before the system has gone flatline." 3. A particular failure mode of video
tubes in which vertical scan is lost, so all one sees is a bright horizontal
line bisecting the screen.
