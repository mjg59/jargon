 :go flatline: [from cyberpunk SF, refers to flattening of EEG traces upon
brain-death] vi., also adjectival `flatlined'. 1. To {die}, terminate, or
fail, esp. irreversibly. In hacker parlance, this is used of machines only,
human death being considered somewhat too serious a matter to employ
jargon-jokes about. 2. To go completely quiescent; said of machines
undergoing controlled shutdown. "You can suffer file damage if you shut down
UNIX but power off before the system has gone flatline." 3. Of a video tube,
to fail by losing vertical scan, so all one sees is a bright horizontal line
bisecting the screen.
