 :Blue Glue: n. [IBM; obs.] IBM's SNA (Systems Network Architecture), an
incredibly {losing} and {bletcherous} communications protocol once widely
favored at commercial shops that didn't know any better (like other
proprietary networking protocols, it became obsolete and effectively
disappeared after the Internet explosion c.1994). The official IBM definition
is "that which binds blue boxes together." see {fear and loathing}. It may
not be irrelevant that Blue Glue is the trade name of a 3M product that is
commonly used to hold down the carpet squares to the removable panel floors
common in {dinosaur pen}s. A correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS
department there has about 80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they
often refer to any messy work to be done as `using the blue glue'.
