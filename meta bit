 :meta bit: /n./ The top bit of an 8-bit character, which is on in character
values 128--255. Also called {high bit}, {alt bit}, or {hobbit}. Some
terminals and consoles (see {space-cadet keyboard}) have a META shift key.
Others (including, *mirabile dictu*, keyboards on IBM PC-class machines) have
an ALT key. see also {bucky bits}. Historical note: although in modern usage
shaped by a universe of 8-bit bytes the meta bit is invariably hex 80 (octal
0200), things were different on earlier machines with 36-bit words and 9-bit
bytes. The MIT and Stanford keyboards (see {space-cadet keyboard}) generated
hex 100 (octal 400) from their meta keys.
