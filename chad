 :chad: /chad/ n. 1. The perforated edge strips on printer paper, after they
have been separated from the printed portion. Also called {selvage} and
{perf}. 2. obs. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper
tape; this has also been called `chaff', `computer confetti', and `keypunch
droppings'. This use may now be mainstream; it has been reported seen (1993)
in directions for a card-based voting machine in California. Historical note:
One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2) derives from the Chadless
keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the card
to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a
circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make
them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be `chad'. There is a
legend that the word was originally acronymic, standing for "Card Hole
Aggregate Debris", but this has all the earmarks of a bogus folk etymology.
