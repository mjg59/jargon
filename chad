 :chad: /chad/ n. 1. The perforated edge strips on printer paper, after they
have been separated from the printed portion. Also called {selvage} and
{perf}. 2. obs. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper
tape; this was also called `chaff', `computer confetti', and `keypunch
droppings'. Historical note: One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2)
derives from the Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little
u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather
than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless
keypunch didn't make them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to
be `chad'.
