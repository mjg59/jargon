 NMI: n. Non-Maskable Interrupt. see {priority interrupt}. no-op: /noh-op/
alt. NOP (nop) [no operation] n. 1. (also v.) A machine instruction that does
nothing (sometimes used in assembler-level programming as filler for data or
patch areas, or to overwrite code to be removed in binaries). see also
{JFCL}. 2. A person who contributes nothing to a project, or has nothing
going on upstairs, or both. As in "He's a no-op." 3. Any operation or
sequence of operations with no effect, such as circling the block without
finding a parking space, or putting money into a vending machine and having
it fall immediately into the coin-return box, or asking someone for help and
being told to go away. "Oh well, that was a no-op." noddy: [Great Britain;
from the children's books] adj. 1. Small and unuseful, but demonstrating a
point. Noddy programs are often written when learning a new language or
system. The archetypal noddy program is {hello, world}. Noddy code may be
used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a compiler. May be used of real
hardware or software to imply that it isn't worth using. "This editor's a bit
noddy." 2. A program that is more or less instant to produce. In this use,
the term does not necessarily connote uselessness, but describes a {hack}
sufficiently trivial that it can be written and debugged while carrying on
(and during the space of) a normal conversation. "I'll just throw together a
noddy {awk} script to convert {crlf}s into {newline}s." see {toy program}.
