 :NMI: /N-M-I/ n. Non-Maskable Interrupt. An IRQ 7 on the PDP-11 or
680[01234]0; the NMI line on an 80[1234]86. In contrast with a {priority
interrupt} (which might be ignored, although that is unlikely), an NMI is
_never_ ignored. Except, that is, on {clone} boxes, where NMI is often
ignored on the motherboard because flaky hardware can generate many spurious
ones.
