 LOGICAL [from the technical term "logical device," wherein a physical device
is referred to by an arbitrary name] adj. Understood to have a meaning not
necessarily corresponding to reality. E.g., if a person who has long held a
certain post (e.g., Les Earnest at SAIL) left and was replaced, the
replacement would for a while be known as the "logical Les Earnest." The word
VIRTUAL is also used. At SAIL, "logical" compass directions denote a
coordinate system in which "logical north" is toward San Francisco, "logical
west" is toward the ocean, etc., even though logical north varies between
physical (true) north near SF and physical west near San Jose. (The best rule
of thumb here is that El Camino Real by definition always runs logical
north-and-south.)
