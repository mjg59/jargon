 :tourist information: n. Information in an on-line display that is not
immediately useful, but contributes to a viewer's gestalt of what's going on
with the software or hardware behind it. Whether a given piece of info falls
in this category depends partly on what the user is looking for at any given
time. The `bytes free' information at the bottom of an MS-DOS `dir' display
is tourist information; so (most of the time) is the TIME information in a
Unix `ps(1)' display.
