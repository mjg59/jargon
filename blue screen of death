 :Blue Screen of Death: n. [common] This term is closely related to the older
{Black Screen of Death} but much more common (many non-hackers have picked it
up). Due to the extreme fragility and bugginess of Microsoft Windows,
misbehaving applications can readily crash the OS (and the OS sometimes
crashes itself spontaneously). The Blue Screen of Death, sometimes decorated
with hex error codes, is what you get when this happens. (Commonly
abbreviated {BSOD}.) The following entry from the Salon Haiku Contest, seems
to have predated popular use of the term: Windows NT crashed. I am the Blue
Screen of Death No one hears your screams.
