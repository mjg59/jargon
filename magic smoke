 :magic smoke: n. A substance trapped inside IC packages that enables them to
function (also called `blue smoke'; this is similar to the archaic
`phlogiston' hypothesis about combustion). Its existence is demonstrated by
what happens when a chip burns up --- the magic smoke gets let out, so it
doesn't work any more. see {smoke test}, {let the smoke out}. USENETter Jay
Maynard tells the following story: "Once, while hacking on a dedicated Z80
system, I was testing code by blowing EPROMs and plugging them in the system,
then seeing what happened. One time, I plugged one in backwards. I only
discovered that *after* I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights
under the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs --- the die was glowing
white-hot. Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased it, filled it full
of zeros, then erased it again. For all I know, it's still in service. Of
course, this is because the magic smoke didn't get let out." Compare the
original phrasing of {Murphy's Law}.
