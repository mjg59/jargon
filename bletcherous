 :bletcherous: /blech'@Â·r@s/, adj. Disgusting in design or function;
esthetically unappealing. This word is seldom used of people. "This keyboard
is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't work very well, or are misplaced.)
see {losing}, {cretinous}, {bagbiting}, {bogus}, and {random}. The term
{bletcherous} applies to the esthetics of the thing so described; similarly
for {cretinous}. By contrast, something that is losing or bagbiting may be
failing to meet objective criteria. see also {bogus} and {random}, which have
richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the above.
