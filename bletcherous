 BLETCHEROUS /blech'@-rus/ adj. Disgusting in design or function;
aesthetically unappealing. This word is seldom used of people. "This keyboard
is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't work very well, or are misplaced).
see LOSING, CRETINOUS, BAGBITING, BOGUS, and RANDOM. BLETCHEROUS applies to
the aesthetics of the thing so described; similarly for CRETINOUS. By
contrast, something that is LOSING or BAGBITING may be failing to meet
objective criteria. see BOGUS and RANDOM, which have richer and wider shades
of meaning than any of the above.
