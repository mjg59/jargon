 :mouse droppings: [MS-DOS] n. Pixels (usually single) that are not properly
restored when the mouse pointer moves away from a particular location on the
screen, producing the appearance that the mouse pointer has left droppings
behind. The major causes for this problem are programs that write to the
screen memory corresponding to the mouse pointer's current location without
hiding the mouse pointer first, and mouse drivers that do not quite support
the graphics mode in use.
