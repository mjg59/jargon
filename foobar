 :foobar: n. [very common] Another widely used {metasyntactic variable}; see
{foo} for etymology. Probably originally propagated through DECsystem manuals
by Digital Equipment Corporation ({DEC}) in 1960s and early 1970s; confirmed
sightings there go back to 1972. Hackers do _not_ generally use this to mean
{FUBAR} in either the slang or jargon sense. see also {Fred Foobar}. In
RFC1639, "FOOBAR" was made an abbreviation for "FTP Operation Over Big
Address Records", but this was an obvious {backronym}. It has been plausibly
suggested that "foobar" spread among early computer engineers partly because
of FUBAR and partly because "foo bar" parses in electronics techspeak as an
inverted foo signal; if a digital signal is active low (so a negative or
zero-voltage condition represents a "1") then a horizontal bar is commonly
placed over the signal label.
