 :finger: [WAITS, via BSD UNIX] 1. n. A program that displays information
about a particular user or all users logged on the system, or a remote
system. Typically shows full name, last login time, idle time, terminal line,
and terminal location (where applicable). May also display a {plan file} left
by the user (see also {Hacking X for Y}). 2. vt. To apply finger to a
username. 3. vt. By extension, to check a human's current state by any means.
"Foodp?" "T!" "OK, finger Lisa and see if she's idle." 4. Any picture
(composed of ASCII characters) depicting `the finger'. Originally a humorous
component of one's plan file to deter the curious fingerer (sense 2), it has
entered the arsenal of some {flamer}s.
