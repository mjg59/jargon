 :letterbomb: 1. n. A piece of {email} containing {live data} intended to do
nefarious things to the recipient's machine or terminal. It used to be
possible, for example, to send letterbombs that would lock up some specific
kinds of terminals when they are viewed, so thoroughly that the user must
cycle power (see {cycle}, sense 3) to unwedge them. Under Unix, a letterbomb
can also try to get part of its contents interpreted as a shell command to
the mailer. The results of this could range from silly to tragic; fortunately
it has been some years since any of the standard Unix/Internet mail software
was vulnerable to such an attack (though, as the Melissa virus attack
demonstrated in early 1999, Microsoft systems can have serious problems). see
also {Trojan horse}; compare {nastygram}. 2. Loosely, a {mailbomb}.
