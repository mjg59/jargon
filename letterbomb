 :letterbomb: n. A piece of {email} containing {live data} intended to do
nefarious things to the recipient's machine or terminal. It is possible, for
example, to send letterbombs that will lock up some specific kinds of
terminals when they are viewed, so thoroughly that the user must cycle power
(see {cycle}, sense 3) to unwedge them. Under UNIX, a letterbomb can also try
to get part of its contents interpreted as a shell command to the mailer. The
results of this could range from silly to tragic. see also {Trojan horse};
compare {nastygram}.
