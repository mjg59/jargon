 :wormhole: /werm'hohl/ n. [from the `wormhole' singularities hypothesized in
some versions of General Relativity theory] 1. [n.,obs.] A location in a
monitor which contains the address of a routine, with the specific intent of
making it easy to substitute a different routine. This term is now
obsolescent; modern operating systems use clusters of wormholes extensively
(for modularization of I/O handling in particular, as in the Unix
device-driver organization) but the preferred techspeak for these clusters is
`device tables', `jump tables' or `capability tables'. 2. [Amateur Packet
Radio] A network path using a commercial satellite link to join two or more
amateur VHF networks. So called because traffic routed through a wormhole
leaves and re-enters the amateur network over great distances with usually
little clue in the message routing header as to how it got from one relay to
the other. Compare {gopher hole} (sense 2).
