 WORMHOLE /werm'hohl/ n. A location in a monitor which contains the address
of a routine, with the specific intent of making it easy to substitute a
different routine. The following quote comes from "Polymorphic Systems", vol.
2, p. 54: Any type of I/O device can be substituted for the standard device
by loading a simple driver routine for that device and installing its address
in one of the monitor's `wormholes.' The term `wormhole' has been used to
describe a hypothetical astronomical situation where a black hole connects to
the `other side' of the universe. When this happens, information can pass
through the wormhole, in only one direction, much as `assumptions' pass down
the monitor's wormholes." This term is now obsolescent. Modern operating
systems use clusters of wormholes extensively (for modularization of I/O
handling in particular, as in the UNIX device-driver organization) but the
preferred jargon for these clusters is `device tables', `jump tables' or
`capability tables'.
