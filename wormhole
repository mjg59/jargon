 WORMHOLE n. A location in a monitor which contains the address of a routine,
with the specific intent of making it easy to substitute a different routine.
The following quote comes from "Polymorphic Systems", vol. 2, p. 54: "Any
type of I/O device can be substituted for the standard device by loading a
simple driver routine for that device and installing its address in one of
the monitor's `wormholes.'* ---------- *The term `wormhole' has been used to
describe a hypothetical astronomical situation where a black hole connects to
the `other side' of the universe. When this happens, information can pass
through the wormhole, in only one direction, much as `assumptions' pass down
the monitor's wormholes."
