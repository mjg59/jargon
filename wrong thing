 :Wrong Thing: /n./ A design, action, or decision that is clearly incorrect
or inappropriate. Often capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if
capitalized. The opposite of the {Right Thing}; more generally, anything that
is not the Right Thing. In cases where `the good is the enemy of the best',
the merely good -- although good -- is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. "In C,
the default is for module-level declarations to be visible everywhere, rather
than just within the module. This is clearly the Wrong Thing."
