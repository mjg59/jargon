 :hung: adj. [from `hung up'; common] Equivalent to {wedged}, but more common
at Unix/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn. with {locked up},
{wedged}; compare {hosed}. see also {hang}. A hung state is distinguished
from {crash}ed or {down}, where the program or system is also unusable but
because it is not running rather than because it is waiting for something.
However, the recovery from both situations is often the same. It is also
distinguished from the similar but more drastic state {wedged} -- hung
software can be woken up with easy things like interrupt keys, but wedged
will need a kill -9 or even reboot.
