 :hung: [from `hung up'] adj. Equivalent to {wedged}, but more common at
UNIX/C sites. Not generally used of people. Syn. with {locked up}, {wedged};
compare {hosed}. see also {hang}. A hung state is distinguished from
{crash}ed or {down}, where the program or system is also unusable but because
it is not running rather than because it is waiting for something. However,
the recovery from both situations is often the same.
