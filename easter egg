 EASTER EGG n. 1. A message hidden in the object code of a program as a joke,
intended to be found by persons disassembling or browsing the code. 2. A
message, graphic, or sound-effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS
ROM) in response to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes, intended
as a joke or to display program credits. One well-known early easter egg
found in a couple of OSs and SOS (q.v.) caused them to respond to the command
`make love' with `not war?'. Many personal computers (other than the IBM PC)
have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM, including lists of the
developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music, and (in one
case) graphics images of the entire development team.
