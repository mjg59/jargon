 :green bytes: /n./ (also `green words') 1. Meta-information embedded in a
file, such as the length of the file or its name; as opposed to keeping such
information in a separate description file or record. The term comes from an
IBM user's group meeting (ca. 1962) at which these two approaches were being
debated and the diagram of the file on the blackboard had the `green bytes'
drawn in green. 2. By extension, the non-data bits in any self-describing
format. "A GIF file contains, among other things, green bytes describing the
packing method for the image." Compare {out-of-band}, {zigamorph}, {fence}
(sense 1).
