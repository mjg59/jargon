 GRAY GOO n. A hypothetical substance composed of billions of
sub-micron-sized Von Neumann machines (self-replicating robots) programmed to
make copies of themselves out of whatever is available. The image that goes
with the term is one of the entire biosphere of Earth being eventually
converted to robot goo. This is the most naive and easiest to refute of the
NANOTECHNOLOGY (q.v.) disaster scenarios.
