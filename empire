 :empire: n. Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game
written by Peter Langston many years ago. A number of multi-player variants
of varying degrees of sophistication exist, and one single-player version
implemented for both Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as
MS-DOS/Windows freeware. All are notoriously addictive. Of various commercial
derivatives the best known is probably "Empire Deluxe" on PCs and Amigas.
Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet by up to 120
players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to a couple of months (long
term). The amount of sleep you can get while playing is a function of the
rate at which updates occur and the number of co-rulers of your country.
Empire server software is available for Unix-like machines, and clients for
Unix and other platforms. A comprehensive history of the game is available at
