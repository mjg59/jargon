 EMPIRE (em'pier) n. Any of a family of military simulations derived from a
game written by Peter Langston many years ago. There are 5 or 6 multi-player
variants of varying degrees of sophistication, and one single-player version
implemented for both UNIX and VMS which is even available as MS-DOS freeware.
All are notoriously addictive.
