 :empire: n. Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game
written by Peter Langston many years ago. Five or six multi-player variants
of varying degrees of sophistication exist, and one single-player version
implemented for both Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as MS-DOS
freeware. All are notoriously addictive.
