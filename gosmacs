 :GOSMACS: /goz'maks/ n. [contraction of `Gosling EMACS'] The first
{EMACS}-in-C implementation, predating but now largely eclipsed by {GNUMACS}.
Originally freeware; a commercial version is now modestly popular as
`UniPress EMACS'. The author (James Gosling) went on to invent {NeWS} and the
programming language Java.
