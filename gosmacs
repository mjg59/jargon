 GOSMACS: /goz'maks/ [contraction of `Gosling EMACS'] n. The first
{EMACS}-in-C implementation, predating but now largely eclipsed by {GNUMACS}.
Originally freeware; a commercial version is now modestly popular as
`UniPress EMACS'. The author (James Gosling) went on to invent {NeWS}.
Gosperism: /gos'p*r-iz-m/ A hack, invention, or saying by arch-hacker R.
William (Bill) Gosper. This notion merits its own term because there are so
many of them. Many of the entries in {HAKMEM} are Gosperisms; see also
{life}. gotcha: n. A {misfeature} of a system, especially a programming
language or environment, that tends to breed bugs or mistakes because it
behaves in an unexpected way. For example, a classic gotcha in {C} is the
fact that `if (a=b) {code;}' is syntactically valid and sometimes even
correct. It puts the value of b into a and then executes `code' if a is
non-zero. What the programmer probably meant was `if (a==b) {code;}' which
executes `code' if a and b are equal.
