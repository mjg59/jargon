 :GOSMACS: /gozÂ´maks/, n. [contraction of `Gosling EMACS'] The first
{EMACS}-in-C implementation, predating but now largely eclipsed by {GNUMACS}.
Originally freeware; a commercial version was modestly popular as `UniPress
EMACS' during the 1980s. The author, James Gosling, went on to invent {NeWS}
and the programming language Java; the latter earned him {demigod} status.
