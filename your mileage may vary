 YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HACKING TOO LONG WHEN... The set-up line for a genre of
one-liners told by hackers about themselves. These include the following: *
not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but you
remember your NETWORK ADDRESS faster than your postal one. * your SO kisses
you on the neck and the first thing you think is "Uh, oh, PRIORITY INTERRUPT"
(q.v.). * you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're doing it
in octal. * your computers have a higher street value than your car. * `round
numbers' are powers of 2, not 10. * you've woken up more than once to recall
of a dream in C or LISP. * you realize you've never met half of your best
friends. All but one of these have been reliably reported as hacker traits
(some of them quite often). Even hackers may have trouble spotting the
ringer. YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY cav. [from the standard disclaimer attached to
EPA mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] A ritual warning often
found in UNIX freeware distributions. Translates roughly as "Hey, I tried to
write this portably but who *knows* what'll happen on your system?"
