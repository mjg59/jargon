 :Your mileage may vary: /cav./ [from the standard disclaimer attached to EPA
mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] 1. A ritual warning often
found in Unix freeware distributions. Translates roughly as "Hey, I tried to
write this portably, but who *knows* what'll happen on your system?" 2. More
generally, a qualifier attached to advice. "I find that sending flowers works
well, but your mileage may vary."
