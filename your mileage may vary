 :Your mileage may vary: cav. [from the standard disclaimer attached to EPA
mileage ratings by American car manufacturers] 1. A ritual warning often
found in UNIX freeware distributions. Translates roughly as "Hey, I tried to
write this portably, but who *knows* what'll happen on your system?" 2. A
qualifier more generally attached to advice. "I find that sending flowers
works well, but your mileage may vary."
