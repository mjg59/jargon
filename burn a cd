 :burn a CD: v. To write a software or document distribution on writable
CDROM. Coined from the fact that a laser is used to inscribe the information
by burning small pits in the medium, and from the fact that disk comes out of
the drive warm to the touch. Writable CDs can be done on a normal desk-top
machine with a suitable drive (so there is no protracted release cycle
associated with making them) but each one takes a long time to make, so they
are not appropriate for volume production. Writable CDs are suitable for
software backups and for short-turnaround-time low-volume software
distribution, such as sending a beta release version to a few selected field
test sites. Compare {cut a tape}.
