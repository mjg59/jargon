 :disk farm: n. A large room or rooms filled with disk drives (esp. {washing
machine}s). This term was well established by 1990, and generalized by about
ten years later; see {farm}. It has become less common as disk strange
densities reached livels where terabytes of storage can easily be fit in a
single rack.
