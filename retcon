 RETCON /ret'-con/ ["retroactive continuity", from USENET's rec.arts.comics]
1. n. the common situation in pulp fiction (esp. comics, soaps) where a new
story "reveals" new things about events previous stories, usually leaving the
"facts" the same (thus preserving "continuity") while completely changing
their interpretation. E.g., revealing that a whole season's episodes of
Dallas was a dream was a retcon. 2. v.t. To write such a story about (a
character or fictitious object). Thus, "Byrne has retconned Superman's cape
so that it is no longer unbreakable". 3. v.i. Used of something "transformed"
in this way - "Marvelman's old adventures were retconned into synthetic
dreams", "Swamp Thing was retconned from a transformed person into a sentient
vegetable." [Ed.note: This is included because it's a good example of hackish
innovation in a field completely unrelated to computers. The word "retcon"
will probably spread through comics fandom and lose its association with
hackerdom within a couple of years; for the record, it started here.]
