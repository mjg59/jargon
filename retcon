 :retcon: /ret'kon/ [short for `retroactive continuity', from the Usenet
newsgroup rec.arts.comics] 1. n. The common situation in pulp fiction (esp.
comics or soap operas) where a new story `reveals' things about events in
previous stories, usually leaving the `facts' the same (thus preserving
continuity) while completely changing their interpretation. For example,
revealing that a whole season of "Dallas" was a dream was a retcon. 2. vt. To
write such a story about a character or fictitious object. "Byrne has
retconned Superman's cape so that it is no longer unbreakable." "Marvelman's
old adventures were retconned into synthetic dreams." "Swamp Thing was
retconned from a transformed person into a sentient vegetable." [This term is
included because it is a good example of hackish linguistic innovation in a
field completely unrelated to computers. The word `retcon' will probably
spread through comics fandom and lose its association with hackerdom within a
couple of years; for the record, it started here. --ESR] [1993 update: some
comics fans on the net now claim that retcon was independently in use in
comics fandom before rec.arts.comics. In lexicography, nothing is ever
simple. --ESR]
