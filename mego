 MEGO: /me'goh/ or /mee'goh/ [My Eyes Glaze Over, often Mine Eyes Glazeth
(sic) Over, attributed to the futurologist Herman Kahn] Also `MEGO factor'.
1. n. Handwaving intended to confuse the listener and hopefully induce
agreement because the listener does not want to admit to not understanding
what is going on. MEGO is usually directed at senior management by engineers
and contains a high proportion of {TLA}s. 2. excl. An appropriate response to
MEGO tactics. meltdown, network: n. A state of complete network overload; the
network equivalent of {thrash}ing. see also {broadcast storm}. meme: /meem/
[coined on analogy with `gene' by Richard Dawkins] n. An idea considered as a
{replicator}. Used esp. in the phrase `meme complex' denoting a group of
mutually supporting memes which form an organized belief system, such as a
religion. This dictionary is a vector of the `hacker subculture' meme
complex; each entry might be considered a meme. However, `meme' is often
misused to mean `meme complex'. Use of the term connotes acceptance of the
idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using sophonts)
cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has superseded biological
evolution by selection of hereditary traits. Hackers find this idea congenial
for tolerably obvious reasons. meme plague: n. The spread of a successful but
pernicious {meme}, esp. one which `parasitizes' the victims into giving their
all to propagate it. Astrology, BASIC, and the other guy's religion are often
considered to be examples. This usage is given point by the historical fact
that `joiner' ideologies like Naziism or various forms of millennarian
Christianity have exhibited plague-like cycles of exponential growth followed
by collapse to small reservoir populations. memetics: /m@-met'iks/ [from
{meme}] The study of memes. As of mid-1991, this is still an extremely
informal and speculative endeavor, though the first steps towards at least
statistical rigor have been made by H. Keith Henson and others. Memetics is a
popular topic among hackers, who like to see themselves as the architects of
the new information ecologies in which memes live and replicate. memory leak:
[C/UNIX programmers] n. An error in a program's dynamic-store allocation
logic that causes it to fail to reclaim discarded memory, leading to
attempted hogging of main store and eventual collapse due to memory
exhaustion. Also (esp. at CMU) called {core leak}. see {aliasing bug},
{fandango on core}, {smash the stack}, {precedence lossage}, {overrun screw},
{leaky heap}. menuitis: /men`yoo-ie'tis/ n. Notional disease suffered by
software with an obsessively simple-minded menu interface and no escape.
Hackers find this intensely irritating and much prefer the flexibility of
command-line or language-style interfaces, especially those customizable via
macros or a special-purpose language in which one can encode useful hacks.
see {user-obsequious}, {drool-proof paper}, {WIMP environment}. mess-dos:
/mes-dos/ [UNIX hackers] n. Derisory term for MS-DOS. Often followed by the
ritual expurgation "Just Say No!". see MS-DOS. Most hackers (even many MS-DOS
hackers) loathe MS-DOS for its single-tasking nature, its limits on
application size, its nasty primitive interface, and its ties to IBMness (see
{fear and loathing}). Also `mess-loss', `messy-dos', `mess-dog', `mess-dross'
and various combinations thereof. In Great Britain it is even sometimes
called `Domestos' after a brand of toilet cleanser. meta: /me't@/ or /may't@/
or (Commonwealth) /mee't@/ [from analytic philosophy] adj. One level of
description up. Thus, a meta-syntactic variable is a variable in notation
used to describe syntax and meta-language is language used to describe
language. This is difficult to explain out of context, but much hacker humor
turns on deliberate confusion between meta-levels. see {{Humor, Hacker}}.
meta bit: n. Bit 8 of an 8-bit character, on in values 128-255. Also called
{high bit} or {alt bit}. Some terminals and consoles (especially those
designed for LISP traditions) have a META shift key. Others (including,
*mirabile dictu*, keyboards on IBM PC-class machines) have an ALT key. see
also {bucky bits}. mickey: n. The resolution unit of mouse movement. In
{OS/2} there is a system call `MouGetNumMickeys()'. It has been suggested
that the `disney' will become a benchmark unit for animation graphics
performance. micro-: pref. 1. Very small; this is the root of its use, as a
quantifier prefix meaning `multiply by `10 ^ -6". Neither of these uses is
peculiar to hackers, but hackers tend to fling them both around rather more
freely than is countenanced in standard English. It is recorded, for example,
that one CS professor used to characterize the standard length of his
lectures as a microcentury --- that is, about 52.6 minutes (Tom Duff at Bell
Labs has also pointed out that "Pi seconds is a nanocentury"). Multiple uses
of the microfortnight and millifortnight (about 1.2 sec and 20 minutes) have
also been reported (see also {attoparsec}, {nanoacre}). 2. Personal or
human-scale --- that is, capable of being maintained or comprehended or
manipulated by one human being. This sense is generalized from
`microcomputer', and esp. used in contrast with `macro-' (Greek prefix
meaning large). 3. Local as opposed to global ({macro-}). Thus a hacker might
say, for example, that buying a smaller car to reduce pollution only solves a
microproblem; the macroproblem of getting to work might be better solved by
using transit, moving to within walking distance, or telecommuting.
microfloppies: n. 3-1/2 inch floppies, as opposed to 5-1/4 {vanilla} or
mini-floppies and the now-obsolete 8-inch variety. This term may be headed
for obsolescence as 5-1/4 inchers pass out of use, only to be revived if
anybody floats a sub-3-inch floppy standard. see {stiffy}, {minifloppies}.
microLenat: n. see {bogosity}. microtape: n. Occasionally used to mean a
DECtape, as opposed to a {macrotape}. A DECtape is a small reel of magnetic
tape about four inches in diameter and an inch deep. Unlike normal drivers
for standard magnetic tapes, microtape drivers allow random access to the
data. In their heyday they were used in pretty much the same ways one would
now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save and transport files
and programs. Apparently the term `microtape' was actually the official term
used within DEC for these tapes until someone consed up the word `DECtape',
which of course sounded sexier to the {marketroid} types. middle-endian: adj.
Not {big-endian} or {little-endian}. Used of byte orders like 3-4-1-2
occasionally found in the packed-decimal formats of minicomputer
manufacturers who shall remain nameless. millilampson: /mil'i-lamp`sn/ n. A
unit of talking speed. Most people run about 200 millilampsons. Butler
Lampson (a CS theorist and systems implementor highly regarded among hackers)
goes at 1000. A few people speak faster. minifloppies: n. 5-1/4 inch
{vanilla} floppy disks, as opposed to 3-1/2 or mini-floppies and the
now-obsolescent 8-inch variety. At one time, this term was a trademark of
Shugart Associates for their SA-400 minifloppy drive. Nobody paid any
attention. see {stiffy}, {microfloppies}.
