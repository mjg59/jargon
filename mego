(sic) Over", attributed to the futurologist Herman Kahn] Also MEGO factor. 1.

what is going on. MEGO is usually directed at senior management by engineers
and contains a high proportion of {TLA}s. 2. excl. An appropriate response to
MEGO tactics. 3. Among non-hackers, often refers not to behavior that causes
the eyes to glaze, but to the eye-glazing reaction itself, which may be
triggered by the mere threat of excessive technical detail as effectively as
by an actual excess of it.
