 :cookie: n. A handle, transaction ID, or other token of agreement between
cooperating programs. "I give him a packet, he gives me back a cookie." The
claim check you get from a dry-cleaning shop is a perfect mundane example of
a cookie; the only thing it's useful for is to relate a later transaction to
this one (so you get the same clothes back). Compare {magic cookie}; see also
{fortune cookie}.
