 :psyton: /si:'ton/ [TMRC] n. The elementary particle carrying the sinister
force. The probability of a process losing is proportional to the number of
psytons falling on it. Psytons are generated by observers, which is why demos
are more likely to fail when lots of people are watching. [This term appears
to have been largely superseded by {bogon}; see also {quantum bogodynamics}.
