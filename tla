 TLA (tee el ay) [Three-Letter-Abbreviation] n. 1. Self-describing acronym
for a species with which computing terminology is infested. 2. Any confusing
acronym at all. Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA, CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU,
TLA, NNTP. People who like this looser usage argue that not all TLAs have
three letters, just as not all four letter words have four letters.
