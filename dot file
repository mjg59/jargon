 :dot file: [Unix] /n./ A file that is not visible by default to normal
directory-browsing tools (on Unix, files named with a leading dot are, by
convention, not normally presented in directory listings). Many programs
define one or more dot files in which startup or configuration information
may be optionally recorded; a user can customize the program's behavior by
creating the appropriate file in the current or home directory. (Therefore,
dot files tend to {creep} -- with every nontrivial application program
defining at least one, a user's home directory can be filled with scores of
dot files, of course without the user's really being aware of it.) see also
{profile} (sense 1), {rc file}.
