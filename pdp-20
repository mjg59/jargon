 :PDP-20: /n./ The most famous computer that never was. {PDP-10} computers
running the {{TOPS-10}} operating system were labeled `DECsystem-10' as a way
of differentiating them from the PDP-11. Later on, those systems running
{TOPS-20} were labeled `DECSYSTEM-20' (the block capitals being the result of
a lawsuit brought against DEC by Singer, which once made a computer called
`system-10'), but contrary to popular lore there was never a `PDP-20'; the
only difference between a 10 and a 20 was the operating system and the color
of the paint. Most (but not all) machines sold to run TOPS-10 were painted
`Basil Blue', whereas most TOPS-20 machines were painted `Chinese Red' (often
mistakenly called orange).
