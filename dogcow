 :dogcow: /dog'kow/ n. see {Moof}. The dogcow is a semi-legendary creature
that lurks in the depths of the Macintosh Technical Notes Hypercard stack
V3.1. The full story of the dogcow is told in technical note #31 (the
particular dogcow illustrated is properly named `Clarus'). Option-shift-click
will cause it to emit a characteristic `Moof!' or `!fooM' sound. _Getting_ to
tech note 31 is the hard part; to discover how to do that, one must needs
examine the stack script with a hackerly eye. Clue: {rot13} is involved. A
dogcow also appears if you choose `Page Setup...' with a LaserWriter selected
and click on the `Options' button. It also lurks in other Mac printer
drivers, notably those for the now-discontinued Style Writers. see
