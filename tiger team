 :tiger team: /n./ [U.S. military jargon] 1. Originally, a team (of
{sneaker}s) whose purpose is to penetrate security, and thus test security
measures. These people are paid professionals who do hacker-type tricks,
e.g., leave cardboard signs saying "bomb" in critical defense installations,
hand-lettered notes saying "Your codebooks have been stolen" (they usually
haven't been) inside safes, etc. After a successful penetration, some
high-ranking security type shows up the next morning for a `security review'
and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks loose. Serious successes
of tiger teams sometimes lead to early retirement for base commanders and
security officers (see the {patch} entry for an example). 2. Recently, and
more generally, any official inspection team or special {firefighting} group
called in to look at a problem. A subset of tiger teams are professional
{cracker}s, testing the security of military computer installations by
attempting remote attacks via networks or supposedly `secure' comm channels.
Some of their escapades, if declassified, would probably rank among the
greatest hacks of all times. The term has been adopted in commercial
computer-security circles in this more specific sense.
