 :hack value: /n./ Often adduced as the reason or motivation for expending
effort toward a seemingly useless goal, the point being that the accomplished
goal is a hack. For example, MacLISP had features for reading and printing
Roman numerals, which were installed purely for hack value. see {display
hack} for one method of computing hack value, but this cannot really be
explained, only experienced. As Louis Armstrong once said when asked to
explain jazz: "Man, if you gotta ask you'll never know." (Feminists please
note Fats Waller's explanation of rhythm: "Lady, if you got to ask you ain't
got it.")
