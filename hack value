 HACK VALUE n. Often adduced as the reason or motivation for expending effort
toward a seemingly useless goal, the point being that the accomplished goal
is a hack. For example, MacLISP has features for reading and printing roman
numerals, which was installed purely for hack value. As a musician once said
of jazz, if you don't understand hack value there is no way it can be
explained.
