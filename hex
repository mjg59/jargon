 :hex: n. 1. Short for {{hexadecimal}}, base 16. 2. A 6-pack of anything
(compare {quad}, sense 2). Neither usage has anything to do with {magic} or
{black art}, though the pun is appreciated and occasionally used by hackers.
True story: As a joke, some hackers once offered some surplus ICs for sale to
be worn as protective amulets against hostile magic. The chips were, of
course, hex inverters.
