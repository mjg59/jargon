 :signal-to-noise ratio: [from analog electronics] /n./ Used by hackers in a
generalization of its technical meaning. `Signal' refers to useful
information conveyed by some communications medium, and `noise' to anything
else on that medium. Hence a low ratio implies that it is not worth paying
attention to the medium in question. Figures for such metaphorical ratios are
never given. The term is most often applied to {Usenet} newsgroups during
{flame war}s. Compare {bandwidth}. see also {coefficient of X}, {lost in the
noise}.
