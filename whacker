 :whacker: /n./ [University of Maryland: from {hacker}] 1. A person, similar
to a {hacker}, who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and
how to stretch their capabilities. Whereas a hacker tends to produce great
hacks, a whacker only ends up whacking the system or program in question.
Whackers are often quite egotistical and eager to claim {wizard} status,
regardless of the views of their peers. 2. A person who is good at
programming quickly, though rather poorly and ineptly.
