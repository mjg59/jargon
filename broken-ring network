 :broken-ring network:Pejorative hackerism for "token-ring network", an early
LAN technology from IBM that lost the standards war to Ethernet. Though
token-ring survives in a few niche markets (such as factory automation) that
put a high premium on resistance to electrical noise, the term is now (2000)
primarily historical.
