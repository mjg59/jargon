 :Tux: Tux the Penguin is the official emblem of {Linux}, This eventuated
after a logo contest in 1996, during which Linus Torvalds endorsed the idea
of a penguin logo in a couple of famously funny postings
(http://www.woodsoup.org/~sbaker/tux/doc/). Linus explained that he was once
bitten by a killer penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for
the species ever since. (Linus has since admitted that he was also thinking
of Feathers McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief who appeared in a
Wallace & Grommit feature cartoon, "The Wrong Trousers".) Larry Ewing
designed (http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/) the official Tux logo. It
has proved a wise choice, amenable to hundreds of recognizable variations
used as emblems of Linux-related projects, products, and user groups. In
fact, Tux has spawned an entire mythology, of which the Gospel According to
Tux (http://www.ao.com/~regan/penguins/tux.html) and the mock-epic poem
"Tuxowolf" are among the best-known examples. There is a `real' Tux - a
black-footed penguin resident at the Bristol Zoo. Several friends of Linux
bought a zoo sponsorship for Linus as a birthday present in 1996.
