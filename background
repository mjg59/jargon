 BACKGROUND (bak'grownd) v.,adj. A task running in background is detached
from the terminal where it was started and running at a lower priority
(oppose FOREGROUND). Nowadays this term is primarily associated with UNIX,
but it was appears first to have been used in this sense on OS/360. By
extension, to do a task "in background" is to do it whenever FOREGROUND
matters are not claiming your undivided attention, and "to background"
something means to relegate it to a lower priority. Compare SLOPSUCKER.
