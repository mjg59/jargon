 :loser: /n./ An unexpectedly bad situation, program, programmer, or person.
Someone who habitually loses. (Even winners can lose occasionally.) Someone
who knows not and knows not that he knows not. Emphatic forms are `real
loser', `total loser', and `complete loser' (but not **`moby loser', which
would be a contradiction in terms). see {luser}.
