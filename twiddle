 TWIDDLE n. 1. tilde (ASCII 176, "~"). Also called "squiggle", "sqiggle"
(sic--pronounced "skig'gul"), and "twaddle", but twiddle is by far the most
common term. 2. A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually fixes
one bug and generates several new ones. 3. v. To change something in a small
way. Bits, for example, are often twiddled. Twiddling a switch or knob
implies much less sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see
FROBNICATE.
