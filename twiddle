 :twiddle: /n./ 1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, `~'). Also called `squiggle',
`sqiggle' (sic -- pronounced /skig'l/), and `twaddle', but twiddle is the
most common term. 2. A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually
fixes one bug and generates several new ones (see also {shotgun debugging}).
3. /vt./ To change something in a small way. Bits, for example, are often
twiddled. Twiddling a switch or knob implies much less sense of purpose than
toggling or tweaking it; see {frobnicate}. To speak of twiddling a bit
connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what you're doing to the
bit; `toggling a bit' has a more specific meaning (see {bit twiddling},
{toggle}).
