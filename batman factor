 :Batman factor: n. 1. An integer number representing the number of items
hanging from a {batbelt}. In most settings, a Batman factor of more than 3 is
not acceptable without odd stares and whispering. This encourages the hacker
in question to choose items for the batbelt carefully to avoid awkward social
situations, usually amongst non-hackers. 2. A somewhat more vaguely defined
index of contribution to sense 1. Devices that are especially obtrusive, such
as large, older model cell phones, "Pocket" PC devices and walkie talkies are
said to have a high batman factor. Sleeker devices such as a later-model Palm
or StarTac phone are prized for their low batman factor and lessened
obtrusiveness and weight.
