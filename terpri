 :terpri: /ter'pree/ /vi./ [from LISP 1.5 (and later, MacLISP)] To output a
{newline}. Now rare as jargon, though still used as techspeak in Common LISP.
It is a contraction of `TERminate PRInt line', named for the fact that, on
some early OSes and hardware, no characters would be printed until a complete
line was formed, so this operation terminated the line and emitted the
output.
