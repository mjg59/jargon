 :Yu-Shiang Whole Fish: /yooÂ·shyang hohl fish/, n. obs. The character gamma
(extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in its tail looks like a
little fish swimming down the page. The term is actually the name of a
Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not {parse}d) and covered with
Yu-Shiang (or Yu-Hsiang) sauce. Usage: primarily by people on the MIT LISP
Machine, which could display this character on the screen. Tends to elicit
incredulity from people who hear about it second-hand. Yu Shiang Whole Fish
is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN SMALL LETTER GAMMA (as opposed
to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which usually has a loopless glyph; the
form of U+0263 is consistently loopy). This symbol is included in Unicode as
a Latin letter because it is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In
the IPA, gamma represents a voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly
transcribed "gh" in Arabic or Klingon. Z zap zapped Zawinski's Law zbeba zen
