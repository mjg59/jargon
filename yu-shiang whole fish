 :Yu-Shiang Whole Fish: /yooÂ·shyang hohl fish/, n. obs. The character gamma
(extended SAIL ASCII 0001001), which with a loop in its tail looks like a
little fish swimming down the page. The term is actually the name of a
Chinese dish in which a fish is cooked whole (not {parse}d) and covered with
Yu-Shiang (or Yu-Hsiang) sauce. Usage: primarily by people on the MIT LISP
Machine, which could display this character on the screen. Tends to elicit
incredulity from people who hear about it second-hand. Z
