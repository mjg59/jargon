 :flarp: /flarp/ n. [Rutgers University] Yet another {metasyntactic variable}
(see {foo}). Among those who use it, it is associated with a legend that any
program not containing the word `flarp' somewhere will not work. The legend
is discreetly silent on the reliability of programs which _do_ contain the
magic word.
