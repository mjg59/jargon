 :Moore's Law: /morz law/ prov. The observation that the logic density of
silicon integrated circuits has closely followed the curve (bits per square
inch) = 2^((t - 1962)) where t is time in years; that is, the amount of
information storable on a given amount of silicon has roughly doubled every
year since the technology was invented. This relation, first uttered in 1964
by semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years
later) held until the late 1970s, at which point the doubling period slowed
to 18 months. It remained at that value through time of writing (late 1995).
