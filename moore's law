 :Moore's Law: /morz law/ prov. The observation that the logic density of
silicon integrated circuits has closely followed the curve (bits per square
inch) = 2^((t - 1962)) where t is time in years; that is, the amount of
information storable on a given amount of silicon has roughly doubled every
year since the technology was invented. see also {Parkinson's Law of Data}.
