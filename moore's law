 MOORE'S LAW /morz law/ n. The observation that the logic density of silicon
integrated circuits has closely followed the curve (bits per inch ** 2) = 2
** (n - 1962); that is, the amount of information storable in one square inch
of silicon has roughly doubled yearly every year since the technology was
invented.
