 :g-file: /n./ [Commodore BBS culture] Any file that is written with the
intention of being read by a human rather than a machine, such as the Jargon
File, documentation, humor files, hacker lore, and technical materials. This
term survives from the nearly forgotten Commodore 64 underground and BBS
community. In the early 80s, C-Net had emerged as the most popular C64 BBS
software for systems which encouraged messaging (as opposed to file
transfer). There were three main options for files: Program files (p-files),
which served the same function as `doors' in today's systems, UD files (the
user upload/download section), and g-files. Anything that was meant to be
read was included in g-files.
