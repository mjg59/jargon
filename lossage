 LOSSAGE /los'@j/ n. The result of a bug or malfunction. This is a collective
noun. "What a loss!" and "What lossage!" are nearly synonymous remarks. The
former is slightly more particular to the speaker's present circumstances
while the latter implies a continuing lose of which the speaker is presently
victim. Thus (for example) a temporary hardware failure is a loss, but bugs
in an important tool (like a compiler) are serious lossage.
