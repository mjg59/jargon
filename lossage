 :lossage: /los'*j/ n. The result of a bug or malfunction. This is a mass or
collective noun. "What a loss!" and "What lossage!" are nearly synonymous.
The former is slightly more particular to the speaker's present
circumstances; the latter implies a continuing {lose} of which the speaker is
currently a victim. Thus (for example) a temporary hardware failure is a
loss, but bugs in an important tool (like a compiler) are serious lossage.
