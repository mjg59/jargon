graphics written under BSD UNIX and subsequently ported to other UNIX
systems. The original BSD `curses(3)' screen-handling package was hacked
together by Ken Arnold to support `rogue(6)' and has since become one of
UNIX's most important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, Omega,
Larn, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games all took off from the
inspiration provided by `rogue(6)'. see {hack}. room-temperature IQ: [IBM] 80

things that might offend some readers, answers to puzzles, or discussion of
movie plot surprises. rotary debugger: [Commodore] n. Essential equipment for
