 :out-of-band: adj. [from telecommunications and network theory] 1. In
software, describes values of a function which are not in its `natural' range
of return values, but are rather signals that some kind of exception has
occurred. Many C functions, for example, return a nonnegative integral value,
but indicate failure with an out-of-band return value of -1. Compare {hidden
flag}, {green bytes}, {fence}. 2. Also sometimes used to describe what
communications people call shift characters, such as the ESC that leads
control sequences for many terminals, or the level shift indicators in the
old 5-bit Baudot codes. 3. In personal communication, using methods other
than email, such as telephones or {snail-mail}.
