 :pointy-haired: adj. [after the character in the {Dilbert} comic strip]
Describes the extreme form of the property that separates {suit}s and
{marketroid}s from hackers. Compare {brain-dead}; {demented}; see {PHB}.
Always applied to people, never to ideas. The plural form is often used as a
noun. "The pointy-haireds ordered me to use Windows NT, but I set up a Linux
server with Samba instead."
