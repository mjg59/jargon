 POM: /pee-oh-em/ n. Common acronym for {phase of the moon}. Usage: usually
used in the phrase `POM-dependent' which means {flaky}. pop: /pop/ [from the
operation that removes the top of a stack, and the fact that procedure return
addresses are saved on the stack] (also capitalized `POP') 1. vt. To remove
something from a {stack} or {pdl}. If a person says he has popped something
from his stack, he means he has finally finished working on it and can now
remove it from the list of things hanging over his head. 2. When a discussion
gets to too deep a level of detail such that the main point of the discussion
is being lost, someone will shout "Pop!" meaning "Get back up to a higher
level!". The shout is frequently accompanied by an upthrust arm with a finger
pointing to the ceiling.
