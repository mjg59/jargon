 :scrool: /skrool/, n. [from the pioneering Roundtable chat system in Houston
ca.: 1984; prob.: originated as a typo for `scroll'] The log of old messages,
available for later perusal or to help one get back in synch with the
conversation. It was originally called the scrool monster, because an early
version of the roundtable software had a bug where it would dump all 8K of
scrool on a user's terminal.
