 :slab: [Apple] 1. n. A continuous horizontal line of pixels, all with the
same color. 2. vi. To paint a slab on an output device. Apple's QuickDraw,
like most other professional-level graphics systems, renders polygons and
lines not with Bresenham's algorithm, but by calculating `slab points' for
each scan line on the screen in succession, and then slabbing in the actual
image pixels.
