 2. Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting. "I finally sat down in
batch mode and wrote out checks for all those bills; I guess they'll turn the
electricity back on next week..." 3. `batching up': Accumulation of a number
of small tasks that can be lumped together for greater efficiency. "I'm
batching up those letters to send sometime" "I'm batching up bottles to take
to the recycling center." :bathtub curve: n. Common term for the curve
(resembling an end-to-end section of one of those claw-footed antique
bathtubs) that describes the expected failure rate of electronics with time:
initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the system's lifetime, then
rising again as it `tires out'. see also {burn-in period}, {infant
mortality}. :Batman factor: n. 1. An integer number representing the number
of items hanging from a {batbelt}. In most settings, a Batman factor of more
than 3 is not acceptable without odd stares and whispering. This encourages
the hacker in question to choose items for the batbelt carefully to avoid
awkward social situations, usually amoungst non-hackers. 2. A somewhat more
vaguely defined index of contribution to sense 1. Devices that are especially
obtrusive, such as large, older model cell phones, "Pocket" PC devices and
walkie talkies are said to have a high batman factor. Sleeker devices such as
a later-model Palm or StarTac phone are prized for their low batman factor
and lessened obtrusiveness and weight. :baud: /bawd/ n. [simplified from its
technical meaning] n. Bits per second. Hence kilobaud or Kbaud, thousands of
bits per second. The technical meaning is `level transitions per second';
this coincides with bps only for two-level modulation with no framing or stop
bits. Most hackers are aware of these nuances but blithely ignore them.
Historical note: `baud' was originally a unit of telegraph signalling speed,
set at one pulse per second. It was proposed at the November, 1926 conference
of the Comite' Consultatif International Des Communications Te'le'graphiques
as an improvement on the then standard practice of referring to line speeds
in terms of words per minute, and named for Jean Maurice Emile Baudot
(1845-1903), a French engineer who did a lot of pioneering work in early
teleprinters. :baud barf: /bawd barf/ n. The garbage one gets a terminal (or
terminal emulator) when using a modem connection with some protocol setting
(esp. line speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice extension on
the same line, or when really bad line noise disrupts the connection. Baud
barf is not completely {random}, by the way; hackers with a lot of
serial-line experience can usually tell whether the device at the other end
is expecting a higher or lower speed than the terminal is set to. _Really_
experienced ones can identify particular speeds. :baz: /baz/ n. 1. [common]
The third {metasyntactic variable} "Suppose we have three functions: FOO,
BAR, and BAZ. FOO calls BAR, which calls BAZ...." (see also {fum}) 2. interj.
A term of mild annoyance. In this usage the term is often drawn out for 2 or
3 seconds, producing an effect not unlike the bleating of a sheep;
/baaaaaaz/. 3. Occasionally appended to {foo} to produce `foobaz'. Earlier
versions of this lexicon derived `baz' as a Stanford corruption of {bar}.
However, Pete Samson (compiler of the {TMRC} lexicon) reports it was already
current when he joined TMRC in 1958. He says "It came from "Pogo". Albert the
Alligator, when vexed or outraged, would shout `Bazz Fazz!' or `Rowrbazzle!'
The club layout was said to model the (mythical) New England counties of
Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with
(Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex)." :bazaar: n.,adj. In 1997, after
meditatating on the success of {Linux} for three years, the Jargon File's own
editor ESR wrote an analytical paper on hacker culture and development models
titled The Cathedral and the Bazaar
(http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/). The main argument of
the paper was that {Brooks's Law} is not the whole story; given the right
social machinery, debugging can be efficiently parallelized across large
numbers of programmers. The title metaphor caught on (see also {cathedral}),
and the style of development typical in the Linux community is now often
referred to as the bazaar mode. Its characteristics include releasing code
early and often, and actively seeking the largest possible pool of peer
reviewers. :bboard: /bee'bord/ n. [contraction of `bulletin board'] 1. Any
electronic bulletin board; esp. used of {BBS} systems running on personal
micros, less frequently of a Usenet {newsgroup} (in fact, use of this term
for a newsgroup generally marks one either as a {newbie} fresh in from the
BBS world or as a real old-timer predating Usenet). 2. At CMU and other
colleges with similar facilities, refers to campus-wide electronic bulletin
boards. 3. The term `physical bboard' is sometimes used to refer to an
old-fashioned, non-electronic cork-and-thumbtack memo board. At CMU, it
refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge. In either of senses 1 or 2,
the term is usually prefixed by the name of the intended board (`the
Moonlight Casino bboard' or `market bboard'); however, if the context is
clear, the better-read bboards may be referred to by name alone, as in (at
CMU) "Don't post for-sale ads on general". :BBS: /B-B-S/ n. [common;
abbreviation, `Bulletin Board System'] An electronic bulletin board system;
that is, a message database where people can log in and leave broadcast
messages for others grouped (typically) into {topic group}s. The term was
especially applied to the thousands of local BBS systems that operated during
the pre-Internet microcomputer era of roughly 1980 to 1995, typically run by
amateurs for fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line
each. Fans of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial timesharing bboards
such as CompuServe and GEnie tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent
district of the hacker culture, but they served a valuable function by
knitting together lots of hackers and users in the personal-micro world who
would otherwise have been unable to exchange code at all. Post-Internet, BBSs
are likely to be local newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has increased but a
certain flavor has been lost. see also {bboard}. :BCPL: // n. [abbreviation,
`Basic Combined Programming Language') A programming language developed by
Martin Richards in Cambridge in 1967. It is remarkable for its rich syntax,
small size of compiler (it can be run in 16k) and extreme portability. It
reached break-even point at a very early stage, and was the language in which
the original {hello world} program was written. It has been ported to so many
different systems that its creator confesses to having lost count. It has
only one data type (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a
character, a floating point number, a pointer, or almost anything else,
depending on context. BCPL was a precursor of C, which inherited some of its
features. :beam: vt. [from Star Trek Classic's "Beam me up, Scotty!"] 1. To
transfer {softcopy} of a file electronically; most often in combining forms
such as `beam me a copy' or `beam that over to his site'. 2. Palm Pilot users
very commonly use this term for the act of exchanging bits via the infrared
links on their machines (this term seems to have originated with the
ill-fated Newton Message Pad). Compare {blast}, {snarf}, {BLT}. :beanie key:
n. [Mac users] see {command key}. :beep: n.,v. Syn. {feep}. This term is
techspeak under MS-DOS and OS/2, and seems to be generally preferred among
micro hobbyists. :Befunge: n. A worthy companion to {INTERCAL}; a computer
language family which escapes the quotidian limitation of linear control flow
and embraces program counters flying through multiple dimensions with exotic
topologies. The Befunge home page is at
`http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/befunge/'. :beige toaster: n. A Macintosh.
see {toaster}; compare {Macintrash}, {maggotbox}. :bells and whistles: n.
[common] Features added to a program or system to make it more {flavorful}
from a hacker's point of view, without necessarily adding to its utility for
its primary function. Distinguished from {chrome}, which is intended to
attract users. "Now that we've got the basic program working, let's go back
and add some bells and whistles." No one seems to know what distinguishes a
bell from a whistle. The recognized emphatic form is "bells, whistles, and
gongs". It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on
theater organs. However, the "and gongs" strongly suggests a different
origin, at sea. Before powered horns, ships routinely used bells, whistles,
and gongs to signal each other over longer distances than voice can carry.
:bells whistles and gongs: n. A standard elaborated form of {bells and
whistles}; typically said with a pronounced and ironic accent on the `gongs'.
:benchmark: n. [techspeak] An inaccurate measure of computer performance. "In
the computer industry, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and
benchmarks." Well-known ones include Whetstone, Dhrystone, Rhealstone (see
{h}), the Gabriel LISP benchmarks (see {gabriel}), the SPECmark suite, and
LINPACK. see also {machoflops}, {MIPS}, {smoke and mirrors}. :Berkeley
Quality Software: adj. (often abbreviated `BQS') Term used in a pejorative
sense to refer to software that was apparently created by rather spaced-out
hackers late at night to solve some unique problem. It usually has
nonexistent, incomplete, or incorrect documentation, has been tested on at
least two examples, and core dumps when anyone else attempts to use it. This
term was frequently applied to early versions of the `dbx(1)' debugger. see
also {Berzerkeley}. Note to British and Commonwealth readers: that's
/berk'lee/, not /bark'lee/ as in British Received Pronunciation. :berklix:
/berk'liks/ n.,adj. [contraction of `Berkeley Unix'] see {BSD}. Not used at
Berkeley itself. May be more common among {suit}s attempting to sound like
cognoscenti than among hackers, who usually just say `BSD'. :Berzerkeley:
/b*r-zer'klee/ n. [from `berserk', via the name of a now-deceased record
label; poss. originated by famed columnist Herb Caen] Humorous distortion of
`Berkeley' used esp. to refer to the practices or products of the {BSD} Unix
hackers. see {software bloat}, {Missed'em-five}, {Berkeley Quality Software}.
Mainstream use of this term in reference to the cultural and political
peculiarities of UC Berkeley as a whole has been reported from as far back as
the 1960s. :beta: /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 1. Mostly
working, but still under test; usu. used with `in': `in beta'. In the {Real
World}, systems (hardware or software) software often go through two stages
of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and Beta (out-house?). Beta releases are
generally made to a group of lucky (or unlucky) trusted customers. 2.
Anything that is new and experimental. "His girlfriend is in beta" means that
he is still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment. 3. Flaky;
dubious; suspect (since beta software is notoriously buggy). Historical note:
More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release (potentially unreliable)
version of a piece of software by making it available to selected (or
self-selected) customers and users. This term derives from early 1960s
terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first used at IBM but later
standard throughout the industry. `Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or
component test phase; `Beta Test' was initial system test. These themselves
came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test was a feasibility
and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment to design and
development. The B-test was a demonstration that the engineering model
functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the
B-test performed on early samples of the production design, and the D test
was the C test repeated after the model had been in production a while. :BFI:
/B-F-I/ n. see {brute force and ignorance}. Also encountered in the variants
`BFMI', `brute force and _massive_ ignorance' and `BFBI' `brute force and
bloody ignorance'. In some parts of the U.S. this abbreviation was probably
reinforced by a company called Browning-Ferris Industries who used to be in
the waste-management business; a large BFI logo in white-on-blue could be
seen on the sides of garbage trucks. :bible: n. 1. One of a small number of
fundamental source books such as {Knuth}, {K&R}, or the {Camel Book}. 2. The
most detailed and authoritative reference for a particular language,
operating system, or other complex software system. :BiCapitalization: n. The
act said to have been performed on trademarks (such as {PostScript}, NeXT,
{NeWS}, VisiCalc, FrameMaker, TK!solver, EasyWriter) that have been raised
above the ruck of common coinage by nonstandard capitalization. Too many
{marketroid} types think this sort of thing is really cute, even the 2,317th
time they do it. Compare {studlycaps}. :B1FF: /bif/ [Usenet] (alt. `BIFF') n.
The most famous {pseudo}, and the prototypical {newbie}. Articles from B1FF
feature all uppercase letters sprinkled liberally with bangs, typos, `cute'
misspellings (EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ HE"S A K00L DOOD AN HE RITES
REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS LIKE THIS!!!), use (and often misuse)
of fragments of {talk mode} abbreviations, a long {sig block} (sometimes even
a {doubled sig}), and unbounded naivete. B1FF posts articles using his elder
brother's VIC-20. B1FF's location is a mystery, as his articles appear to
come from a variety of sites. However, {BITNET} seems to be the most frequent
origin. The theory that B1FF is a denizen of BITNET is supported by B1FF's
(unfortunately invalid) electronic mail address: B1FF@BIT.NET. [1993: Now It
Can Be Told! My spies inform me that B1FF was originally created by Joe
Talmadge <jat@cup.hp.com>, also the author of the infamous and
much-plagiarized "Flamer's Bible". The BIFF filter he wrote was later passed
to Richard Sexton, who posted BIFFisms much more widely. Versions have since
been posted for the amusement of the net at large. see also {Jeff K.} --ESR]
