 FUNKY (fuhn'kee) adj. Said of something which functions, but in a slightly
strange, klugey way. It does the job and would be difficult to change, so its
obvious non-optimality is left alone. Often used to describe interfaces. The
more bugs something has that nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds
are easier, the funkier it is. TECO and UUCP are funky. The Intel i860's
exception handling is extraordinarily funky. Most standards acquire funkiness
as they age. "The new mailer is installed, but is still somewhat funky; if it
bounces your mail for no reason, try resubmitting it." "This UART is pretty
funky. The data ready line is active-high in interrupt mode, and active-low
in DMA mode." see FUGGLY.
