 :molly-guard: /mol'ee-gard/ n. [University of Illinois] A shield to prevent
tripping of some {Big Red Switch} by clumsy or ignorant hands. Originally
used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an IBM 4341 after a
programmer's toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice in one day.
Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk drives and
networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you'll see the much less
interesting description "guarded button".
