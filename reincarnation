 REINCARNATION, CYCLE OF (ree-in-kar-nay'shn) n. Term used to refer to a
well-known effect whereby function in a computing system family is migrated
out to special purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the peripheral
evolves towards more computing power as it does its job, then somebody
notices that it's inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors in the
architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU, at which point
the cycle begins again. Several iterations of this cycle have been observed
in graphics processor design, and at least one or two in communications and
floating-point processors.
