 :quadruple bucky: n. obs. 1. On an MIT {space-cadet keyboard}, use of all
four of the shifting keys (control, meta, hyper, and super) while typing a
character key. 2. On a Stanford or MIT keyboard in {raw mode}, use of four
shift keys while typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are the
control and meta keys on _both_ sides of the keyboard. This was very
difficult to do! One accepted technique was to press the left-control and
left-meta keys with your left hand, the right-control and right-meta keys
with your right hand, and the fifth key with your nose. Quadruple-bucky
combinations were very seldom used in practice, because when one invented a
new command one usually assigned it to some character that was easier to
type. If you want to imply that a program has ridiculously many commands or
features, you can say something like: "Oh, the command that makes it spin the
tapes while whistling Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
quadruple-bucky-cokebottle." see {double bucky}, {bucky bits}, {cokebottle}.
