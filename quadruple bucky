 QUADRUPLE BUCKY n., obs. On a SPACE-CADET KEYBOARD (q.v.), use of all four
of the shifting keys control, meta, hyper, and super while typing a character
key. This was very difficult to do! One accepted technique was to press the
left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the right-control and
right-meta keys with your right hand, and the fifth key with your nose. Thus,
this combination was very seldom used in practice, because when you invent a
new command you usually assign it to some character that is easier to type.
If you want to imply that a program has ridiculously many commands or
features, you can say something like "Oh, the command that makes it spin all
the tapes while whistling Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
quadruple-bucky-cokebottle". see DOUBLE BUCKY, BUCKY BITS.
