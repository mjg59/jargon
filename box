 :box: n. 1. A computer; esp. in the construction `foo box' where foo is some
functional qualifier, like `graphics', or the name of an OS (thus, `UNIX
box', `MS-DOS box', etc.) "We preprocess the data on UNIX boxes before
handing it up to the mainframe." 2. [IBM] Without qualification but within an
SNA-using site, this refers specifically to an IBM front-end processor or FEP
/F-E-P/. An FEP is a small computer necessary to enable an IBM {mainframe} to
communicate beyond the limits of the {dinosaur pen}. Typically used in
expressions like the cry that goes up when an SNA network goes down: "Looks
like the {box} has fallen over." (see {fall over}.) See also {IBM}, {fear and
loathing}, {fepped out}, {Blue Glue}.
