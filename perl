 :Perl: /perl/ n. [Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a.
Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by
Larry Wall (<<larry@wall.org>>, author of `patch(1)' and `rn(1)') and
distributed over Usenet. Superficially resembles {awk}, but is much hairier,
including many facilities reminiscent of `sed(1)' and shells and a
comprehensive Unix system-call interface. Unix sysadmins, who are almost
always incorrigible hackers, generally consider it one of the {languages of
choice}, and it is by far the most widely used tool for making `live' web
pages via CGI. Perl has been described, in a parody of a famous remark about
`lex(1)', as the {Swiss-Army chainsaw} of Unix programming. Though Perl is
very useful, it would be a stretch to describe it as pretty or {elegant};
people who like clean, spare design generally prefer {Python}. see also
{Camel Book}, {TMTOWTDI}.
