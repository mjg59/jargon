 :Perl: /perl/ [Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a
Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister] n. An interpreted language developed
by Larry Wall <lwall@jpl.nasa.gov>, author of `patch(1)' and `rn(1)') and
distributed over USENET. Superficially resembles `awk(1)', but is much
hairier (see {awk}). UNIX sysadmins, who are almost always incorrigible
hackers, increasingly consider it one of the {languages of choice}. Perl has
been described, in a parody of a famous remark about `lex(1)', as the
"Swiss-Army chainsaw" of UNIX programming.
