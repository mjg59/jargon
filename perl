 :Perl: /perl/ n. [Practical Extraction and Report Language, a.k.a
Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister] An interpreted language developed by
Larry Wall <lwall@jpl.nasa.gov>, author of `patch(1)' and `rn(1)') and
distributed over USENET. Superficially resembles {awk}, but is much hairier,
including many facilities reminiscent of `sed(1)' and shell and a
comprehensive UNIX system-call interface. UNIX sysadmins, who are almost
always incorrigible hackers, increasingly consider it one of the {languages
of choice}. Perl has been described, in a parody of a famous remark about
`lex(1)', as the "Swiss-Army chainsaw" of UNIX programming.
