 PERL [Practical Extraction and Report Language, aka Pathologically Eclectic
Rubbish Lister] n. An interpreted language developed by Larry Wall
(lwall@jpl.nasa.gov, author of patch(1)) and distributed over USENET.
Superficially resembles awk(1), but is much more arcane (see AWK).
Increasingly considered a LANGUAGE OF CHOICE by UNIX sysadmins, who are
almost always incorrigible hackers. Perl has been described, in a parody of a
famous remark about lex(1), as the "Swiss-army chainsaw" of UNIX programming.
