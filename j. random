 :J. Random: /J rand'm/ /n./ [generalized from {J. Random Hacker}] Arbitrary;
ordinary; any one; any old. `J. Random' is often prefixed to a noun to make a
name out of it. It means roughly `some particular' or `any specific one'.
"Would you let J. Random Loser marry your daughter?" The most common uses are
`J. Random Hacker', `J. Random Loser', and `J. Random Nerd' ("Should J.
Random Loser be allowed to {gun} down other people?"), but it can be used
simply as an elaborate version of {random} in any sense.
