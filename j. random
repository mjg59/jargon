 :J. Random: /J randÂ´m/, n. [common; generalized from {J. Random Hacker}]
Arbitrary; ordinary; any one; any old. `J. Random' is often prefixed to a
noun to make a name out of it. It means roughly some particular or any
specific one. "Would you let J. Random Loser marry your daughter?" The most
common uses are `J. Random Hacker', `J. Random Loser', and `J. Random Nerd'
("Should J. Random Loser be allowed to kill other peoples' processes?"), but
it can be used simply as an elaborate version of {random} in any sense.
