 :quantum bogodynamics: /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/ n. A theory that
characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such as politicians,
used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and {suit}s in general), bogon sinks (such
as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields. Bogon absorption,
of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and
may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however, the precise mechanics
of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood and remain to be
elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is most often invoked to explain the sharp
increase in hardware and software failures in the presence of suits; the
latter emit bogons, which the former absorb. see {bogon}, {computron},
{suit}, {psyton}.
