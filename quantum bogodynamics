 QUANTUM BOGODYNAMICS /kwahn'tm boh`goh-die-nam'iks/ n. Theory promulgated by
ESR which characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources (such as
politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and SUITs in general), bogon
sinks (such as taxpayers and computers), and bogosity potential fields. Bogon
absorption, of course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines
to fail (and may cause them to emit secondary bogons as well); however, the
precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood
and remain to be elucidated. Quantum bogodynamics is most frequently invoked
to explain the sharp increase in hardware and software failures in the
presence of suits; the latter emit bogons which the former absorb. see BOGON,
COMPUTRON, SUIT.
