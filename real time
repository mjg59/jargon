 :real time: 1. [techspeak] /adj./ Describes an application which requires a
program to respond to stimuli within some small upper limit of response time
(typically milli- or microseconds). Process control at a chemical plant is
the classic example. Such applications often require special operating
systems (because everything else must take a back seat to response time) and
speed-tuned hardware. 2. /adv./ In jargon, refers to doing something while
people are watching or waiting. "I asked her how to find the calling
procedure's program counter on the stack and she came up with an algorithm in
real time."
