 :BartleMUD: /bar'tl-muhd/ n. Any of the MUDs derived from the original MUD
game by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw (see {MUD}). BartleMUDs are noted for
their (usually slightly offbeat) humor, dry but friendly syntax, and lack of
adjectives in object descriptions, so a player is likely to come across
`brand172', for instance (see {brand brand brand}). Bartle has taken a bad
rap in some MUDding circles for supposedly originating this term, but (like
the story that MUD is a trademark) this appears to be a myth; he uses `MUD1'.
