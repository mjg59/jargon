 :Dr. Fred Mbogo: /@m·boh´goh, dok´tr fred/, n. [Stanford] The archetypal man
you don't want to see about a problem, esp. an incompetent professional; a
shyster. "Do you know a good eye doctor?" "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and
Professional Dry Cleaning." The name comes from synergy between {bogus} and
the original Dr. Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the
old Addams Family TV show. Interestingly enough, it turns out that under the
rules for Swahili noun classes, `m-' is the characteristic prefix of "nouns
referring to human beings". As such, "mbogo" is quite plausible as a Swahili
coinage for a person having the nature of a {bogon}. Actually, "mbogo" is
indeed a Ki-Swahili word referring to the African Cape Buffalo, syncerus
caffer. It is one of the "big five" dangerous African game animals, and many
people with bush experience believe it to be the most dangerous of them.
