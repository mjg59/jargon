 :smart terminal: n. 1. A terminal that has enough computing capability to
render graphics or to offload some kind of front-end processing from the
computer it talks to. The development of workstations and personal computers
has made this term and the product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may
still hear variants of the phrase `act like a smart terminal' used to
describe the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to programs that
execute almost entirely out of a remote {server}'s storage, using said
devices as displays. Compare {glass tty}. 2. obs. Any terminal with an
addressable cursor; the opposite of a {glass tty}. Today, a terminal with
merely an addressable cursor, but with none of the more-powerful features
mentioned in sense 1, is called a {dumb terminal}. There is a classic quote
from Rob Pike (inventor of the {blit} terminal): "A smart terminal is not a
smart*ass* terminal, but rather a terminal you can educate." This illustrates
a common design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or anything else)
intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid `special features' that
become just so much dead weight if you try to use the device in any way the
designer didn't anticipate. Flexibility and programmability, on the other
hand, are *really* smart. Compare {hook}.
