 SMART TERMINAL n. A terminal that has enough computing capability to perform
useful work independently of the main computer. The development of
workstations and personal computers has made this term and the product it
describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still hear variants of the phrase
"act like a smart terminal" used to describe the behavior of workstations/PCs
with respect to programs that execute almost entirely out of a remote
SERVER's storage, using said devices as displays. There's a classic quote
from Rob Pike (inventor of the BLIT (q.v.) terminal): "A smart terminal is
not a smart*ass* terminal, but rather a terminal you can educate." This
illustrates a common design problem; the attempt to make peripherals (or
anything else) intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid "special
features" that become just so much dead weight if you try to use the device
in any way the designer didn't anticipate. Flexibility and programmability,
on the other hand, are *really* smart.
