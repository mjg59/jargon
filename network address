 :network address: n. (also `net address') As used by hackers, means an
address on `the' network (see {network, the}; this is almost always a {bang
path} or {{Internet address}}). Such an address is essential if one wants to
be to be taken seriously by hackers; in particular, persons or organizations
that claim to understand, work with, sell to, or recruit from among hackers
but *don't* display net addresses are quietly presumed to be clueless poseurs
and mentally flushed (see {flush}, sense 4). Hackers often put their net
addresses on their business cards and wear them prominently in contexts where
they expect to meet other hackers face-to-face (see also {{science-fiction
fandom}}). This is mostly functional, but is also a signal that one
identifies with hackerdom (like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts
among Grateful Dead fans). Net addresses are often used in email text as a
more concise substitute for personal names; indeed, hackers may come to know
each other quite well by network names without ever learning each others'
`legal' monikers. see also {sitename}, {domainist}.
