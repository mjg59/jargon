 :network address: n. (also `net address') As used by hackers, means an
address on `the' network (see {the network}; this used to include {bang path}
addresses but now always implies an Internet address). Net addresses are
often used in email text as a more concise substitute for personal names;
indeed, hackers may come to know each other quite well by network names
without ever learning each others' `legal' monikers. Display of a network
address (e.g. on business cards) used to function as an important hacker
identification signal, like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts
among Grateful Dead fans. In the day of pervasive Internet this is less true,
but you can still be fairly sure that anyone with a network address
handwritten on his or her convention badge is a hacker.
