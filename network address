 NETWORK ADDRESS n. As used by hackers, means an address on THE NETWORK
(almost always a BANG PATH or INTERNET ADDRESS). An essential to be taken
seriously by hackers; in particular, persons or organizations claiming to
understand, work with, sell to, or recruit from among hackers that *don't*
display net addresses are quietly presumed to be clueless poseurs and
mentally FLUSHED (sense #3). Hackers often put their net addresses on their
business cards and wear them prominently in contexts where they expect to
meet other hackers face-to-face (see also SCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM) This is
mostly functional, but is also a connotative signal that one identifies with
hackerdom (like lodge pins among Masons or tie-died T-shirts among Grateful
Dead fans). Net addresses are often used in email text as a more concise
substitute for personal names; indeed, hackers may come to know each other
quite well by network names without ever learning each others' `legal'
monikers.
