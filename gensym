 :gensym: /jen'sim/ [from MacLISP for `generated symbol'] 1. /v./ To invent a
new name for something temporary, in such a way that the name is almost
certainly not in conflict with one already in use. 2. /n./ The resulting
name. The canonical form of a gensym is `Gnnnn' where nnnn represents a
number; any LISP hacker would recognize G0093 (for example) as a gensym. 3. A
freshly generated data structure with a gensymmed name. Gensymmed names are
useful for storing or uniquely identifying crufties (see {cruft}).
