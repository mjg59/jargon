 :ooblick: /oo'blik/ [from Dr. Seuss's `Bartholomew and the Oobleck'] n. A
bizarre semi-liquid sludge made from cornstarch and water. Enjoyed among
hackers who make batches during playtime at parties for its amusing and
extremely non-Newtonian behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid
motion like a solid and will even crack when hit by a hammer. Often found
near lasers. Here is a field-tested ooblick recipe contributed by GLS: 1 cup
cornstarch 1 cup baking soda 3/4 cup water N drops of food coloring This
recipe isn't quite as non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch ooblick, but has an
appropriately slimy feel. Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick
*recipe* is far too mechanical, and that it is best to add the water in small
increments so that the various mixed states the cornstarch goes through as it
*becomes* ooblick can be grokked in fullness by many hands. For optional
ingredients of this experience, see the "{Ceremonial Chemicals}" section of
{appendix B}.
