 OOBLICK /oo'blik/ [from Dr. Seuss' "Bartholomew and the Ooblick"] n. A
bizarre semi-liquid sludge made from cornstarch and water. Enjoyed among
hackers who make batches for playtime at parties for its amusing and
extremely non-Newtonian behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid
motion like a solid and will even crack when hit by a hammer. Often found
near lasers.
