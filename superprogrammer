 :superprogrammer: n. A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly
well and quickly. Not all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are.
(Productivity can vary from one programmer to another by three orders of
magnitude. For example, one programmer might be able to write an average of 3
lines of working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools, might
be able to write 3,000. This range is astonishing; it is matched in very few
other areas of human endeavor.) The term superprogrammer is more commonly
used within such places as IBM than in the hacker community. It tends to
stress naive measures of productivity and to underweight creativity,
ingenuity, and getting the job done -- and to sidestep the question of
whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work than three lines
that do the {Right Thing}. Hackers tend to prefer the terms {hacker} and
{wizard}.
