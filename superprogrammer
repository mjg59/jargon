 SUPERPROGRAMMER n. A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly well
and quickly. Not all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are.
(Productivity can vary from one programmer to another by factors of as much
as 1000. For example, programmer A might be able to write an average of 3
lines of working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools and
skill, might be able to write 3,000 lines of working code in one day. This
variance is astonishing, appearing in very few other areas of human
endeavor.) The term SUPERPROGRAMMER is more commonly used within such places
as IBM than in the hacker community. It tends to stress productivity rather
than creativity or ingenuity. Hackers tend to prefer the terms HACKER and
WIZARD.
