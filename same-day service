 :same-day service: n. Ironic term used to describe long response time,
particularly with respect to {{MS-DOS}} system calls (which ought to require
only a tiny fraction of a second to execute). Such response time is a major
incentive for programmers to write programs that are not {well-behaved}. see
also {PC-ism}.
