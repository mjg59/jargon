 :Infinite-Monkey Theorem: n. "If you put an {infinite} number of monkeys at
typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet." (One may
also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of time.)
This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one {random}
monkey that eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will
also type out all the possible _incorrect_ versions of Hamlet). It may be
referred to semi-seriously when justifying a {brute force} method; the
implication is that, with enough resources thrown at it, any technical
challenge becomes a {one-banana problem}. This argument gets more respect
since {Linux} justified the {bazaar} mode of development. This theorem was
first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington. It became part of
the idiom of techies via the classic SF short story "Inflexible Logic" by
Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through a reference in
Douglas Adams's "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". On 1 April 2000 the usage
acquired its own Internet standard, RFC2795
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt) (Infinite Monkey Protocol Suite).
