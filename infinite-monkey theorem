 :Infinite-Monkey Theorem: n. "If you put an {infinite} number of monkeys at
typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet." (One may
also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of time.)
This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one {random}
monkey that eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will
also type out all the possible *incorrect* versions of Hamlet). It may be
referred to semi-seriously when justifying a {brute force} method; the
implication is that, with enough resources thrown at it, any technical
challenge becomes a {one-banana problem}. This theorem was first popularized
by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington. It became part of the idiom of
techies via the classic SF short story "Inflexible Logic" by Russell Maloney,
and many younger hackers know it through a reference in Douglas Adams's
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".
