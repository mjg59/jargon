 :Infinite-Monkey Theorem: n. "If you put an {infinite} number of monkeys at
typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for Hamlet." (One may
also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a very long period of time.)
This theorem asserts nothing about the intelligence of the one {random}
monkey that eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will
also type out all the possible *incorrect* versions of Hamlet). It may be
referred to semi-seriously when justifying a {brute force} method; the
implication is that, with enough resources thrown at it, any technical
challenge becomes a {one-banana problem}. This theorem seems to have
originated in the classic SF short story "Inflexible Logic" by Russell
Maloney, but was widely popularized by a reference in Douglas Adam's
`Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.
