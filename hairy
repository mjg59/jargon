 :hairy: adj. 1. Annoyingly complicated. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 2.
Incomprehensible. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 3. Of people, high-powered,
authoritative, rare, expert, and/or incomprehensible. Hard to explain except
in context: "He knows this hairy lawyer who says there's nothing to worry
about." see also {hirsute}. There is a well-known result in topology called
the Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem, which states that any continuous
transformation of a surface into itself has at least one fixed point.
Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term `hairy' with the
informal version of this theorem; "You can't comb a hairy ball smooth." The
adjective `long-haired' is well-attested to have been in slang use among
scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it was equivalent to modern
`hairy' senses 1 and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the hackish use. In
fact the noun `long-hair' was at the time used to describe a person
satisfying sense 3. Both senses probably passed out of use when long hair was
adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s counterculture, leaving hackish
`hairy' as a sort of stunted mutant relic.
