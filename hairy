 :hairy: adj. 1. Annoyingly complicated. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 2.
Incomprehensible. "{DWIM} is incredibly hairy." 3. Of people, high-powered,
authoritative, rare, expert, and/or incomprehensible. Hard to explain except
in context: "He knows this hairy lawyer who says there's nothing to worry
about." see also {hirsute}. There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory
which states that any continuous tangent field on a 2-sphere is null at least
in a point. Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term
`hairy' with the informal version of this theorem; "You can't comb a hairy
ball smooth." (Previous versions of this entry associating the above informal
statement with the Brouwer fixed-point theorem were incorrect.) The adjective
`long-haired' is well-attested to have been in slang use among scientists and
engineers during the early 1950s; it was equivalent to modern hairy senses 1
and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the hackish use. In fact the noun
`long-hair' was at the time used to describe a person satisfying sense 3.
Both senses probably passed out of use when long hair was adopted as a
signature trait by the 1960s counterculture, leaving hackish hairy as a sort
of stunted mutant relic. In British mainstream use, "hairy" means
"dangerous", and consequently, in British programming terms, "hairy" may be
used to denote complicated and/or incomprehensible code, but only if that
complexity or incomprehesiveness is also considered dangerous.
