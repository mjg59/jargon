 :punched card:: alt. `punch card' [techspeak] n.obs. The signature medium of
computing's {Stone Age}, now obsolescent outside of some IBM shops. The
punched card actually predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as
a control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith and
used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece
of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm, designed to fit exactly in the currency
trays used for that era's larger dollar bills. IBM (which originated as a
tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the punched card to computers,
encoding binary information as patterns of small rectangular holes; one
character per column, 80 columns per card. Other coding schemes, sizes of
card, and hole shapes were tried at various times. The 80-column width of
most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM punched card; so is the size
of the quick-reference cards distributed with many varieties of computers
even today. see {chad}, {chad box}, {eighty-column mind}, {green card},
