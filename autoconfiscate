 :autoconfiscate: To set up or modify a source-code {distribution} so that it
configures and builds using the GNU project's autoconf/automake/libtools
suite. Among open-source hackers, a mere running binary of a program is not
considered a full release; what's interesting is a source tree that can be
built into binaries using standard tools. Since the mid-1990s, autoconf and
friends been the standard way to adapt a distribution for portability so that
it can be built on multiple operating systems without change.
