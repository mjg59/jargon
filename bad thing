 :Bad Thing: n. [very common; always pronounced as if capitalized. Orig. fr.
the 1930 Sellar & Yeatman parody of British history "1066 And All That", but
well-established among hackers in the U.S. as well.] Something that can't
possibly result in improvement of the subject. This term is always
capitalized, as in "Replacing all of the 9600-baud modems with bicycle
couriers would be a Bad Thing". Oppose {Good Thing}. British correspondents
confirm that {Bad Thing} and {Good Thing} (and prob. therefore {Right Thing}
and {Wrong Thing}) come from the book referenced in the etymology, which
discusses rulers who were Good Kings but Bad Things. This has apparently
created a mainstream idiom on the British side of the pond. It is very common
among American hackers, but not in mainstream usage here. Compare {Bad and
Wrong}.
