 BAD THING n. Something which can't possibly result in improvement of the
subject. This term is always capitalized, as in "Replacing all of the 9600
baud modems with bicycle couriers would be a Bad Thing." Oppose GOOD THING.
One correspondent suggests that BAD THING and GOOD THING (and prob. therefore
RIGHT THING and WRONG THING) come from the book "1066 and All That", which
discusses rulers who were Good Kings, but Bad Things.
