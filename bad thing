 :Bad Thing: /n./ [from the 1930 Sellar & Yeatman parody "1066 And All That"]
Something that can't possibly result in improvement of the subject. This term
is always capitalized, as in "Replacing all of the 9600-baud modems with
bicycle couriers would be a Bad Thing". Oppose {Good Thing}. British
correspondents confirm that {Bad Thing} and {Good Thing} (and prob. therefore
{Right Thing} and {Wrong Thing}) come from the book referenced in the
etymology, which discusses rulers who were Good Kings but Bad Things. This
has apparently created a mainstream idiom on the British side of the pond.
