 :terminal junkie: [UK] n. A {wannabee} or early {larval stage} hacker who
spends most of his or her time wandering the directory tree and writing
{noddy} programs just to get a fix of computer time. Variants include
`terminal jockey', `console junkie', and {console jockey}. The term `console
jockey' seems to imply more expertise than the other three (possibly because
of the exalted status of the {{console}} relative to an ordinary terminal).
