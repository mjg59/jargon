 :for free: /adj./ Said of a capability of a programming language or hardware
equipment that is available by its design without needing cleverness to
implement: "In APL, we get the matrix operations for free." "And owing to the
way revisions are stored in this system, you get revision trees for free."
The term usually refers to a serendipitous feature of doing things a certain
way (compare {big win}), but it may refer to an intentional but secondary
feature.
