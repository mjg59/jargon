 :wall follower: n. A person or algorithm that compensates for lack of
sophistication or native stupidity by efficiently following some simple
procedure shown to have been effective in the past. Used of an algorithm,
this is not necessarily pejorative; it recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the
winning robot in an early AI contest (named, of course, after the cocktail).
Harvey successfully solved mazes by keeping a `finger' on one wall and
running till it came out the other end. This was inelegant, but it was
mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes --- and, in fact,
Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that tried to `learn' each maze
by building an internal representation of it. Used of humans, the term *is*
pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic, by-the-book mentality.
