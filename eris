 :Eris: /eÂ´ris/, n. The Greek goddess of Chaos, Discord, Confusion, and
Things You Know Not Of; her name was latinized to Discordia and she was
worshiped by that name in Rome. Not a very friendly deity in the Classical
original, she was reinvented as a more benign personification of creative
anarchy starting in 1959 by the adherents of {Discordianism} and has since
been a semi-serious subject of veneration in several `fringe' cultures,
including hackerdom. see {Discordianism}, {Church of the SubGenius}.
