 ERIS (e'r@s) pn. The Greco-Roman goddess of Chaos, Discord, Confusion and
Things You Know Not Of; aka Discordia. Not a very friendly deity in the
Classical original, she was re-invented as a more benign personification of
creative anarchy starting in 1959 by the adherents of DISCORDIANISM and has
since been a semi-serious subject of veneration in several `fringe' cultures
including hackerdom. see DISCORDIANISM, CHURCH OF THE SUB-GENIUS.
