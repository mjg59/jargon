 2. In the design of languages and other software tools, `the fascist
alternative' is the most restrictive and structured way of capturing a
particular function; the implication is that this may be desirable in order
to simplify the implementation or provide tighter error checking. Compare
{bondage-and-discipline language}, although that term is global rather than
local. :fat electrons: n. Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on the
causation of computer glitches. Your typical electric utility draws its line
current out of the big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the
top of the dynamo. When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off
line to clean them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the _bottom_ of the
coil. Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary
or `thin' electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are heavier and so
settle to the bottom of the generator. These flow down ordinary wires just
fine, but when they have to turn a sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit
via), they're apt to get stuck. This is what causes computer glitches.
[Fascinating. Obviously, fat electrons must gain mass by {bogon} absorption
--ESR] Compare {bogon}, {magic smoke}. :faulty: adj. Non-functional; buggy.
Same denotation as {bletcherous}, {losing}, q.v., but the connotation is much
milder. :fd leak: /F-D leek/ n. A kind of programming bug analogous to a
{core leak}, in which a program fails to close file descriptors (`fd's) after
file operations are completed, and thus eventually runs out of them. see
{leak}. :fear and loathing: n. [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state inspired by
the prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems and standards that
are totally {brain-damaged} but ubiquitous -- Intel 8086s, or {COBOL}, or
{{EBCDIC}}, or any {IBM} machine except the Rios (a.k.a. the RS/6000). "Ack!
They want PCs to be able to talk to the AI machine. Fear and loathing time!"
:feature: n. 1. A good property or behavior (as of a program). Whether it was
intended or not is immaterial. 2. An intended property or behavior (as of a
program). Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
{misfeature}). 3. A surprising property or behavior; in particular, one that
is purposely inconsistent because it works better that way -- such an
inconsistency is therefore a {feature} and not a {bug}. This kind of feature
is sometimes called a {miswart}; see that entry for a classic example. 4. A
property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though perhaps also
impressive or cute. For example, one feature of Common LISP's `format'
function is the ability to print numbers in two different Roman-numeral
formats (see {bells whistles and gongs}). 5. A property or behavior that was
put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your way. 6. A bug that
has been documented. To call something a feature sometimes means the author
of the program did not consider the particular case, and that the program
responded in a way that was unexpected but not strictly incorrect. A standard
joke is that a bug can be turned into a {feature} simply by documenting it
(then theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in the manual),
or even by simply declaring it to be good. "That's not a bug, that's a
feature!" is a common catchphrase. see also {feetch feetch}, {creeping
featurism}, {wart}, {green lightning}. The relationship among bugs, features,
misfeatures, warts, and miswarts might be clarified by the following
hypothetical exchange between two hackers on an airliner: A: "This seat
doesn't recline." B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature. There is an
emergency exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
be kept clear." A: "Oh. Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased
the spacing between rows here." B: "Yes. But if they'd increased spacing in
only one section it would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced seats." A: "A
miswart, actually. If they increased spacing throughout they'd lose several
rows and a chunk out of the profit margin. So unequal spacing would actually
be the Right Thing." B: "Indeed." `Undocumented feature' is a common,
allegedly humorous euphemism for a {bug}. There's a related joke that is
sometimes referred to as the "one-question geek test". You say to someone "I
saw a Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read FEATURE".
If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see {computer geek}, sense #2). :feature
creature: n. [poss. fr. slang `creature feature' for a horror movie] 1. One
who loves to add features to designs or programs, perhaps at the expense of
coherence, concision, or {taste}. 2. Alternately, a mythical being that
induces otherwise rational programmers to perpetrate such crocks. see also
{feeping creaturism}, {creeping featurism}. :feature creep: n. The result of
{creeping featurism}, as in "Emacs has a bad case of feature creep". :feature
key: n. The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf graphic on its keytop;
sometimes referred to as `flower', `pretzel', `clover', `propeller', `beanie'
(an apparent reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie), {splat},
or the `command key'. The proliferation of terms for this creature may
illustrate one subtle peril of iconic interfaces. Many people have been
mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that appears on the feature key. Its
oldest name is `cross of St. Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking
art as a decorative motif. Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use
it to mark sites of historical interest. Apple picked up the symbol from an
early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish. Apple documentation gives the
translation "interesting feature"! There is some dispute as to the proper
(Swedish) name of this symbol. It technically stands for the word
`seva"rdhet' (interesting feature); many of these are old churches. Some
Swedes report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to English
`church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in modern Swedish.
Others say this is nonsense. Another idiom reported for the sign is `runsten'
/roon'stn/, derived from the fact that many of the interesting features are
Viking rune-stones. :feature shock: n. [from Alvin Toffler's book title
"Future Shock"] A user's (or programmer's!) confusion when confronted with a
package that has too many features and poor introductory material.
:featurectomy: /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n. The act of removing a feature from a
program. Featurectomies come in two flavors, the `righteous' and the
`reluctant'. Righteous featurectomies are performed because the remover
believes the program would be more elegant without the feature, or there is
already an equivalent and better way to achieve the same end. (Doing so is
not quite the same thing as removing a {misfeature}.) Reluctant
featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint such as code
size or execution speed. :feep: /feep/ 1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound
of a display terminal (except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the
microcomputer world seems to prefer {beep}). 2. vi. To cause the display to
make a feep sound. ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do not feep; they have
mechanical bells that ring. Alternate forms: {beep}, `bleep', or just about
anything suitably onomatopoeic. (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe",
uses the word `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video games;
this is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.) The term `breedle'
was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not particularly
soft (they sound more like the musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx
cheer; for a close approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek
communicator's beep lasting for five seconds). The `feeper' on a VT-52 has
been compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. see also
{ding}. :feeper: /fee'pr/ n. The device in a terminal or workstation (usually
a loudspeaker of some kind) that makes the {feep} sound. :feeping creature:
n. [from {feeping creaturism}] An unnecessary feature; a bit of {chrome}
that, in the speaker's judgment, is the camel's nose for a whole horde of new
features. :feeping creaturism: /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n. A deliberate
spoonerism for {creeping featurism}, meant to imply that the system or
program in question has become a misshapen creature of hacks. This term isn't
really well defined, but it sounds so neat that most hackers have said or
heard it. It is probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about
in the dark making their customary noises. :feetch feetch: /feech feech/
interj. If someone tells you about some new improvement to a program, you
might respond: "Feetch, feetch!" The meaning of this depends critically on
vocal inflection. With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy, that's
great! What a great hack!" Grudgingly or with obvious doubt, it means "I
don't know; it sounds like just one more unnecessary and complicated thing".
With a tone of resignation, it means, "Well,
