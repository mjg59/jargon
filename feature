 FEATURE". If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see {computer geek}, sense 2).
:feature creature: n. [poss. fr. slang `creature feature' for a horror movie]
1. One who loves to add features to designs or programs, perhaps at the
expense of coherence, concision, or {taste}. 2. Alternately, a mythical being
that induces otherwise rational programmers to perpetrate such crocks. see
also {feeping creaturism}, {creeping featurism}. :feature creep: n. [common]
The result of {creeping featurism}, as in "Emacs has a bad case of feature
creep". :feature key: n. [common] The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf
graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower', `pretzel',
`clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an apparent reference to the major feature
of a propeller beanie), {splat}, or the `command key'. The proliferation of
terms for this creature may illustrate one subtle peril of iconic interfaces.
Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that appears on
the feature key. Its oldest name is `cross of St. Hannes', but it occurs in
pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative motif. Throughout Scandinavia today
the road agencies use it to mark sites of historical interest. Apple picked
up the symbol from an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish. Apple
documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"! There is some
dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol. It technically stands
for the word `seva"rdhet' (interesting feature); many of these are old
churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to
English `church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in modern
Swedish. Others say this is nonsense. Another idiom reported for the sign is
`runsten' /roon'stn/, derived from the fact that many of the interesting
features are Viking rune-stones. :feature shock: n. [from Alvin Toffler's
book title "Future Shock"] A user's (or programmer's!) confusion when
confronted with a package that has too many features and poor introductory
material. :featurectomy: /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n. The act of removing a
feature from a program. Featurectomies come in two flavors, the `righteous'
and the `reluctant'. Righteous featurectomies are performed because the
remover believes the program would be more elegant without the feature, or
there is already an equivalent and better way to achieve the same end. (Doing
so is not quite the same thing as removing a {misfeature}.) Reluctant
featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint such as code
size or execution speed. :feep: /feep/ 1. n. The soft electronic `bell' sound
of a display terminal (except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the
microcomputer world seems to prefer {beep}). 2. vi. To cause the display to
make a feep sound. ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do not feep; they have
mechanical bells that ring. Alternate forms: {beep}, `bleep', or just about
anything suitably onomatopoeic. (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe",
uses the word `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video games;
this is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.) The term `breedle'
was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal bleepers are not particularly
soft (they sound more like the musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx
cheer; for a close approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek
communicator's beep lasting for five seconds). The `feeper' on a VT-52 has
been compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears. see also
{ding}. :feeper: /fee'pr/ n. The device in a terminal or workstation (usually
a loudspeaker of some kind) that makes the {feep} sound. :feeping creature:
n. [from {feeping creaturism}] An unnecessary feature; a bit of {chrome}
that, in the speaker's judgment, is the camel's nose for a whole horde of new
features. :feeping creaturism: /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n. A deliberate
spoonerism for {creeping featurism}, meant to imply that the system or
program in question has become a misshapen creature of hacks. This term isn't
really well defined, but it sounds so neat that most hackers have said or
heard it. It is probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about
in the dark making their customary noises. :feetch feetch: /feech feech/
interj. If someone tells you about some new improvement to a program, you
might respond: "Feetch, feetch!" The meaning of this depends critically on
vocal inflection. With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy, that's
great! What a great hack!" Grudgingly or with obvious doubt, it means "I
don't know; it sounds like just one more unnecessary and complicated thing".
With a tone of resignation, it means, "Well,
