 :feature: /n./ 1. A good property or behavior (as of a program). Whether it
was intended or not is immaterial. 2. An intended property or behavior (as of
a program). Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
{misfeature}). 3. A surprising property or behavior; in particular, one that
is purposely inconsistent because it works better that way -- such an
inconsistency is therefore a {feature} and not a {bug}. This kind of feature
is sometimes called a {miswart}; see that entry for a classic example. 4. A
property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though perhaps also
impressive or cute. For example, one feature of Common LISP's `format'
function is the ability to print numbers in two different Roman-numeral
formats (see {bells, whistles, and gongs}). 5. A property or behavior that
was put in to help someone else but that happens to be in your way. 6. A bug
that has been documented. To call something a feature sometimes means the
author of the program did not consider the particular case, and that the
program responded in a way that was unexpected but not strictly incorrect. A
standard joke is that a bug can be turned into a {feature} simply by
documenting it (then theoretically no one can complain about it because it's
in the manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good. "That's not a bug,
that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase. see also {feetch feetch},
{creeping featurism}, {wart}, {green lightning}. The relationship among bugs,
features, misfeatures, warts, and miswarts might be clarified by the
following hypothetical exchange between two hackers on an airliner: A: "This
seat doesn't recline." B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature. There is an
emergency exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
be kept clear." A: "Oh. Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased
the spacing between rows here." B: "Yes. But if they'd increased spacing in
only one section it would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced seats." A: "A
miswart, actually. If they increased spacing throughout they'd lose several
rows and a chunk out of the profit margin. So unequal spacing would actually
be the Right Thing." B: "Indeed." `Undocumented feature' is a common,
allegedly humorous euphemism for a {bug}. There's a related joke that is
sometimes referred to as the "one-question geek test". You say to someone "I
saw a Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read FEATURE".
If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see {computer geek}, sense #2).
