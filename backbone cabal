 :backbone cabal: n. A group of large-site administrators who pushed through
the {Great Renaming} and reined in the chaos of {Usenet} during most of the
1980s. During most of its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes
capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; it was almost obligatory
for anyone privy to their secrets to respond "There is no Cabal" whenever the
existence or activities of the group were speculated on in public. The result
of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a decade after the
cabal {mailing list} disbanded in late 1988 following a bitter internal
catfight, many people believed (or claimed to believe) that it had not
actually disbanded but only gone deeper underground with its power intact.
This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various Cabals
with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the Usenet or
Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that took on a life of
their own. see {Eric Conspiracy} for one example. Part of the background for
this kind of humor is that many hackers cultivate a fondness for conspiracy
theory considered as a kind of surrealist art; see the bibliography entry om
Illuminatus! for the novel that launched this trend. see {NANA} for the
subsequent history of "the Cabal".
