 :code: 1. n. The stuff that software writers write, either in source form or
after translation by a compiler or assembler. Often used in opposition to
"data", which is the stuff that code operates on. Among hackers this is a
mass noun, as in "How much code does it take to do a {bubble sort}?", or "The
code is loaded at the high end of RAM." Among scientific programmers it is
sometimes a count noun equilvalent to "program"; thus they may speak of
"codes" in the plural. Anyone referring to software as "the software codes"
is probably a {newbie} or a {suit}. 2. v. To write code. In this sense,
always refers to source code rather than compiled. "I coded an Emacs clone in
two hours!" This verb is a bit of a cultural marker associated with the Unix
and minicomputer traditions (and lately Linux); people within that culture
prefer v. `code' to v. `program' whereas outside it the reverse is normally
true.
