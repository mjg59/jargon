 :code: n. The stuff that software writers write, either in source form or
after translation by a compiler or assembler. Often used in opposition to
"data", which is the stuff that code operates on. This is a mass noun, as in
"How much code does it take to do a {bubble sort}?", or "The code is loaded
at the high end of RAM." Anyone referring to software as "the software codes"
is probably a {newbie} or a {suit}.
