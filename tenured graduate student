 :tenured graduate student: /n./ One who has been in graduate school for 10
years (the usual maximum is 5 or 6): a `ten-yeared' student (get it?).
Actually, this term may be used of any grad student beginning in his seventh
year. Students don't really get tenure, of course, the way professors do, but
a tenth-year graduate student has probably been around the university longer
than any untenured professor.
