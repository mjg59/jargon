 TENURED GRADUATE STUDENT n. One who has been in graduate school for ten
years (the usual maximum is five or six): a "ten-yeared" student (get it?).
Students don't really get tenure, of course, the way professors do, but a
tenth-year graduate student has probably been around the university longer
than any non-tenured professor.
