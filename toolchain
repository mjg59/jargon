 :toolchain: A collection of tools used to develop for a particular hardware
target, or to work with a particular data format (thus `the Crusoe
development toolchain', or the `DocBook toolchain'). Often used in the
context of building software on one system which will be installed or run on
some other device; in that case the chain of tools usually consists of such
items as a particular version of a compiler, libraries, special headers, etc.
May also be used of text-formatting, page layout, or multimedia tools which
render from some markup to a variety of production formats. Differs from
`toolkit' in that the former implies a collection of semi-independent tools
with complementary functions, while `toolchain' implies that each of the
parts is a serial stage in a rather tightly bound pipeline. seems to have
become current in early 1999 and 2000; now common.
