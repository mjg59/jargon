 :posing: n. On a {MUD}, the use of `:' or an equivalent command to announce
to other players that one is taking a certain physical action that has no
effect on the game (it may, however, serve as a social signal or propaganda
device that induces other people to take game actions). For example, if one's
character name is Firechild, one might type `: looks delighted at the idea
and begins hacking on the nearest terminal' to broadcast a message that says
"Firechild looks delighted at the idea and begins hacking on the nearest
terminal". see {RL}.
