 JR[LN]: /jay ahr en/, /jay ahr el/ n. The names JRN and JRL were sometimes
used as example names when discussing a kind of user ID used under {TOPS-10};
they were understood to be the initials of (fictitious) programmers named `J.
Random Nerd' and `J. Random Loser' (see {J. Random}). For example, if one
said "To log in, type log one comma jay are en" (that is, "log 1,JRN"), the
listener would have understood that he should use his own computer id in
place of `JRN'. juggling eggs: vi. Keeping a lot of {state} in your head
while modifying a program. "Don't bother me now, I'm juggling eggs", meaning
an interrupt is likely to result in the program being scrambled. In the
classic first-contact SF novel `The Mote in God's Eye' by Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle, an alien describes a very difficult task by saying "We
juggle priceless eggs in variable gravity." That was a very hackish use of
language. see also {hack mode}. jump off into never-never land: [from J. M.
Barrie's `Peter Pan'] v. Same as {branch to Fishkill}, but more common in
technical cultures associated with non-IBM computers that use the term `jump'
rather than `branch'. Compare {hyperspace}. = K = ===== K: /kay/ [from
{kilo-}] n. A kilobyte. This is used both as a spoken word and a written
suffix (like {meg} and {gig} for megabyte and gigabyte). The formal SI metric
prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use this strictly, reserving `K' for
multiplication by 1024 (KB is `kilobytes'). see also {{quantifiers}}. K&R:
[Kernighan and Ritchie] n. Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie's `The C
Programming Language', esp. the classic and influential first edition
(Prentice-Hall 1978, ISBN 0-113-110163-3). Syn. {White Book}, {Old
Testament}. see also {New Testament}. kahuna: /k*-hoo'nuh/ [IBM, from the
Hawaiian title for a shaman] n. Synonym for {wizard}, {guru}. kamikaze
packet: n. The `official' jargon for what is more commonly called a
{Christmas tree packet}. RFC1025, `TCP and IP Bake Off' says: 10 points for
correctly being able to process a "Kamikaze" packet (AKA nastygram, christmas
tree packet, lamp test segment, et al.). That is, correctly handle a segment
with the maximum combination of features at once (e.g., a SYN URG PUSH FIN
segment with options and data). see also {Chernobyl packet}. ken: /ken/ n. 1.
[UNIX] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of UNIX. In the early days he used to
hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that read "Love, ken."
Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes uncapitalized) in third-person
reference; it is widely understood (on USENET, in particular) that without a
last name `Ken' refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, Dennis without last
name means Dennis Ritchie. see also {net.god}, {UNIX}. 2. A flaming user.
This was originated by the Software Support group at Symbolics because the
two greatest flamers in the user community were both named Ken. kgbvax:
/kay-jee-bee-vaks/ n. see {kremvax}. kill file: [USENET] n. (alt. `KILL
file') Per-user file(s) used by some {USENET} reading programs (originally
Larry Wall's `rn(1)') to discard summarily (without presenting for reading)
articles which match some particularly uninteresting (or unwanted) patterns
of subject, author, or other header lines. Thus to "add a person (or subject)
to one's kill file" is to arrange for that person to be ignored by one's
newsreader in future. By extension, it may be used for a decision to ignore
the person or subject in other media. see also {plonk}. killer micro:
[popularized by Eugene Brooks] n. A microprocessor-based machine that
infringes on mini, mainframe or supercomputer performance turf. Often heard
in "No one will survive the attack of the killer micros!", the battle cry of
the downsizers. Used esp. of RISC architectures. killer poke: n. A recipe for
inducing hardware damage on a machine via insertion of invalid values (see
{poke}) in a memory-mapped control register; used esp. of various fairly
well-known tricks on MMU-less {bitty box}es like the IBM PC and Commodore PET
that can overload and trash analog electronics in the monitor. see also
{HCF}. kilo-: pref. see {{quantifiers}}. KIPS: [acronym, by analogy with
{MIPS} using {K}] n. Thousands (*not* 1024s) of Instructions Per Second.
Usage: rare.
