 JR[LN]: /jay ahr en/, /jay ahr el/ n. The names JRN and JRL were sometimes
used as example names when discussing a kind of user ID used under {TOPS-10};
they were understood to be the initials of (fictitious) programmers named `J.
Random Nerd' and `J. Random Loser' (see {J. Random}). For example, if one
said "To log in, type log one comma jay are en" (that is, "log 1,JRN"), the
listener would have understood that he should use his own computer id in
place of `JRN'. jump off into never-never land: [from J. M. Barrie's `Peter
Pan'] v. Same as {branch to Fishkill}, but more common in technical cultures
associated with non-IBM computers that use the term `jump' rather than
`branch'. Compare {hyperspace}. = K = ===== K: /kay/ [from {kilo-}] n. A
kilobyte. This is used both as a spoken word and a written suffix (like {meg}
and {gig} for megabyte and gigabyte). The formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is
`k'; some people use this strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024.
see also {kilo-}. K&R: [Kernighan and Ritchie] n. Brian Kernighan & Dennis
Ritchie's `The C Programming Language', esp. the classic and influential
first edition (Prentice-Hall 1978, ISBN 0-113-110163-3). Syn. {White Book},
{Old Testament}. see also {New Testament}. kahuna: /k@-hoo'nuh/ [IBM, from
the Hawaiian title for a shaman] n. Synonym for {wizard}, {guru}. kamikaze
packet: n. The `official' jargon for what is more commonly called a
{Christmas tree packet}. RFC1025, `TCP and IP Bake Off' says: 10 points for
correctly being able to process a "Kamikaze" packet (AKA nastygram, christmas
tree packet, lamp test segment, et al.). That is, correctly handle a segment
with the maximum combination of features at once (e.g., a SYN URG PUSH FIN
segment with options and data). see also {Chernobyl packet}. ken: /ken/ n. A
flaming user. This was originated by the Software Support group at Symbolics
because the two greatest flamers in the user community were both named Ken.
kgbvax: /kay-jee-bee-vaks/ n. see {kremvax}. kill file: [USENET] n. (alt.
`KILL file') Per-user file(s) used by some {USENET} reading programs
(originally Larry Wall's `rn(1)') to discard summarily (without presenting
for reading) articles which match some particularly uninteresting (or
unwanted) patterns of subject, author, or other header lines. Thus to "add a
person (or subject) to one's kill file" is to arrange for that person to be
ignored by one's newsreader in future. By extension, it may be used for a
decision to ignore the person or subject in other media. see also {plonk}.
killer micro: [popularized by Eugene Brooks] n. A microprocessor-based
machine that infringes on mini, mainframe or supercomputer performance turf.
Often heard in "No one will survive the attack of the killer micros!", the
battle cry of the downsizers. Used esp. of RISC architectures. killer poke:
n. A recipe for inducing hardware damage on a machine via insertion of
invalid values (see {poke}) in a memory-mapped control register; used esp. of
various fairly well-known tricks on MMU-less {bitty box}es like the IBM PC
and Commodore PET that can overload and trash analog electronics in the
monitor. see also {HCF}. kilo-: [from metric measure] pref. 1. Used with
anything that naturally comes in powers of 2 (especially byte quantities),
`kilo-' usually denotes multiplication by 1024. 2. With units of time or
things that come in powers of 10, such as money, it retains its usual meaning
of multiplication of 1000. Similarly, the higher metric prefixes may denote
multiplication by powers of 1024 = 2 ^ 10 rather than of 1000: prefix binary
decimal kilo- 1024 ^ 1 = 2 ^ 10 1,024 mega- 1024 ^ 2 = 2 ^ 20 1,048,576 giga-
1024 ^ 3 = 2 ^ 30 1,073,741,824 tera- 1024 ^ 4 = 2 ^ 40 1,099,511,627,776
peta- 1024 ^ 5 = 2 ^ 50 1,125,899,906,842,624 exa- 1024 ^ 6 = 2 ^ 60
1,152,921,504,606,846,976. Confusion of 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2
and 10 close in magnitude), for example, describing memory in units of 500K
or 524K (see {K}) instead of 512K, is a sure sign of the {marketroid}. see
also {mega-}, {giga-}, {tera-}, {peta-}, {exa-}. KIPS: [acronym, by analogy
with {MIPS} using {K}] n. Thousands (*not* 1024s) of Instructions Per Second.
Usage: rare.
