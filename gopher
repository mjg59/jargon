 :gopher: n. A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and now
(1994) being obsolesced by the World-Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing
interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents,
runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the net. Some
claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed at the
University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a sports
team). Others claim the word derives from American slang `gofer' (from "go
for", dialectical "go fer"), one whose job is to run and fetch things.
Finally, observe that gophers (aka woodchucks) dig long tunnels, and the idea
of tunneling through the net to find information was a defining metaphor for
the developers. Probably all three things were true, but with the first two
coming first and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor and
impetus to the project as it developed out of its concept stage.
