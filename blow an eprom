 :blow an EPROM: /bloh *n ee'prom/ v. (alt. `blast an EPROM', `burn an
EPROM') To program a read-only memory, e.g. for use with an embedded system.
This term arises because the programming process for the Programmable
Read-Only Memories (PROMs) that preceded present-day Erasable Programmable
Read-Only Memories (EPROMs) involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical
fuses on the chip. Thus, one was said to `blow' (or `blast') a PROM, and the
terminology carried over even though the write process on EPROMs is
nondestructive.
