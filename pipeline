 PIPELINE (piep'lien) [UNIX, orig. by Doug McIlroy; now also used under
MS-DOS and elsewhere] n. A chain of FILTER programs connected "head-to-tail",
that is so that the output of one becomes the input of the next. Under UNIX,
user utilities can often be implemented or at least prototyped by a suitable
collection of pipelines and temp-file grinding encapsulated in a shell
script; this is much less effort than writing C every time, and the
capability is considered one of UNIX's major WINNING features.
