 :killer app:The application that actually makes a sustaining market for a
promising but under-utilized technology. First used in the mid-1980s to
describe Lotus 1-2-3 once it became evident that demand for that product had
been the major driver of the early business market for IBM PCs. The term was
then restrospectively applied to VisiCalc, which had played a similar role in
the success of the Apple II. After 1994 it became commonplace to describe the
World Wide Web as the Internet's killer app. One of the standard questions
asked about each new personal-computer technology as it emerges has become
"what's the killer app?"
