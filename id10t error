 :ID10T error: /I·D·ten·T er'@r/ Synonym for {PEBKAC}, e.g. "The user is
being an idiot". Tech-support people passing a problem report to someone
higher up the food chain (and presumably better equipped to deal with idiots)
may ask the user to convey that there seems to be an I-D-ten-T error. Users
never twig.
