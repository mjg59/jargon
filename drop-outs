 :drop-outs: n. 1. A variety of `power glitch' (see {glitch}); momentary 0
voltage on the electrical mains. 2. Missing characters in typed input due to
software malfunction or system saturation (one cause of such behavior under
Unix when a bad connection to a modem swamps the processor with spurious
character interrupts; see {screaming tty}). 3. Mental glitches; used as a way
of describing those occasions when the mind just seems to shut down for a
couple of beats. see {glitch}, {fried}.
