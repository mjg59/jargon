 :blogosphere: The totality of all {blog}s. A culture heavily overlapping
with but not coincident with hackerdom; a few of its key coinages
({blogrolling}, {fisking}, {anti-idiotarianism}) are recorded in this lexicon
for flavor. Bloggers often divide themselves into warbloggers and
techbloggers. The techbloggers write about technology and technology policy,
while the warbloggers are more politically focused and tend to be preoccupied
with U.S. and world response to the post-9/11 war against terrorism. The
overlap with hackerdom is heaviest among the techbloggers, but several of the
most prominent warbloggers are also hackers. Bloggers in general tend to be
aware of and sympathetic to the hacker culture.
