 CHURCH OF THE SUB-GENIUS n. A mutant offshoot of DISCORDIANISM launched in
1981 as a spoof of fundamentalist Christianity by the "Rev." Ivan Stang, a
brilliant satirist with a gift for promotion. Popular among hackers as a rich
source of bizarre imagery and references such as: "Bob" the divine
drilling-equipment salesman, the Benevolent Space Xists and the Stark Fist of
Removal. Much Sub-Genius theory is concerned with the acquisition of the
mystical substance or quality of "slack". see also HA HA ONLY SERIOUS.
