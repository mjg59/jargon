 :progasm: /proh´gaz·m/, n. [University of Wisconsin] The euphoria
experienced upon the completion of a program or other computer-related
project. For example, the rush you get when you finally run the code you've
been hacking for the past week and it works first time. (The quality of the
experience is directly proportional to the complexity of the code and
inversely proportional to the amount of debugging it took to get the code
working.) Compare {geekasm}.
