 ========= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 2.5.1 29 JAN 1991
================= Introduction ************ This document is a collection of
slang terms used by various subcultures of computer hackers. Though some
technical material is included for background and flavor, it is not a
technical dictionary; what we describe here is the language hackers use among
themselves for fun, social communication and debate within their communities.
The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values. It has its own myths, heroes,
villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos and dreams. Because hackers as a group
are particularly creative people who define themselves partly by rejection of
`normal' values and working habits, it has unusually rich and conscious
traditions for an intentional culture less than thirty-five years old.
Hackers, as a rule, love word-play and are very conscious in their use of
language. Thus, a compilation of their slang is a particularly effective
window into their culture --- and, in fact, this one is the latest version of
an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File' maintained by hackers
themselves for over fifteen years. This one (like its ancestors) is primarily
a lexicon, but also includes `topic entries' which collect background or
sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to
subsume under a single term. These are distinguished by being in SMALL CAPS.
Though the format is that of a reference, it is also intended that the
material be enjoyable to browse or read straight through. Even a complete
outsider should find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that
is amusingly thought-provoking. But it is also true that hackers use humorous
word-play to make strong, sometime combative statements about what they feel.
Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in disputes which
have been genuinely passionate, and they deliberately reflect this. We have
not tried to moderate or pretty up these disputes; rather we have attempted
to ensure that *everyone's* sacred cows get gored, impartially. Compromise is
not particularly a hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent
viewpoints is. They reader with minimal computer background who finds some
references incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them. We have not
felt it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor and one of this document's major intended audiences
(fledgeling hackers already partway inside the culture) will benefit from
them. A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor are included
in appendix A. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly directed to
Appendix B, the Portrait of J. Random Hacker. Appendix C is a bibliography of
non-technical works which have either influenced or described the hacker
culture. Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one which each
individual must choose consciously to join), one should not be surprised that
the line between description and influence can become more than a little
blurred. Earlier Jargon File versions have played a central role in spreading
hacker language and the culture that goes with it to successively larger
populations, and we hope and expect that this one will do likewise. Revision
History ================ The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker
slang from technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities, Carnegie-Mellon
University (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). The Jargon File
(hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File') was begun by Raphael
Finkel at Stanford in 1975, though some terms in it date back considerably
earlier (<frob> and some senses of <moby>, for instance, go back to the MIT
Model Railroad Club and are are believed to date at least back to the early
nineteen-sixties). The revisions of jargon-1 were all un-numbered and may be
collectively considered `Version 1'. In 1976, Mark Crispin brought the File
to MIT; he and Guy Steele then added a first wave of new entries. Richard
Frankel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter, and Don Woods
became the SAIL contact for the file (which was subsequently kept in
duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic re-synchronizations). The file
expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman was prominent
among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related coinages. A late
version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass market, was edited
by Guy L. Steele into a book published in 1983 as `The Hacker's Dictionary'
(Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8). The other jargon-1 editors
(Raphael Finkel, Don Woods and Mark Crispin) contributed to the revision, as
did also Richard M. Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow. This book is hereafter
referred to as `Steele-1983'. It is now out of print. Shortly after the
publication of Steele-1983 the File effectively stopped growing and changing.
The PDP-10-centered cultures that had originally nourished it were dealt a
serious blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at DEC. The AI-Lab
culture died and its best and brightest dispersed; the File's compilers moved
on to other things. By the mid-1980s the File's contents was dated, but the
legend that had grown up around it never quite died out. The book and
softcopies snarfed off the ARPANET circulated even in cultures far removed
from MIT's; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence on hackish
slang and humor. Even as the advent of the microcomputer and other trends
fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File (and related materials
like the AI Koans in Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a
hacker-culture Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the
Knights of the Lab. The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated
tremendously, but the Jargon File passed from living document to icon and
remained essentially untouched for seven years. This revision contains nearly
the entire text of a late version of jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related
entries have been dropped following careful consultation with the editors of
Steele-1983). It merges in about about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting
some framing material and a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 which
are now also obsolescent. This new version casts a wider net than the old
jargon file; its aim is to cover not just AI but all the technical computing
cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested. More than half of the
entries now derive from USENET and represent slang now current in the C and
UNIX communities, but special efforts have been made to collect slang from
other cultures including IBM-PC programmers, Mac fans and even the IBM
mainframe world. Where a term can be attributred to a particular subculture
or is known to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate. Here is a
list of abbreviations used in etymologies: Berkeley University of California
at Berkeley. Cambridge Cambridge University, England (*not* Cambridge, Mass!).
