 ============ THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 2.7.1, 1 MAR 1991 ============
Introduction ************ This document is a collection of slang terms used
by various subcultures of computer hackers. Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we
describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for fun, social
communication, and technical debate within their communities. The `hacker
culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of subcultures that is
nevertheless conscious of some important shared experiences, shared roots,
and shared values. It has its own myths, heroes, villains, folk epics,
in-jokes, taboos, and dreams. Because hackers as a group are particularly
creative people who define themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values
and working habits, it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an
intentional culture less than thirty-five years old. As usual with slang, the
special vocabulary of hackers helps hold their culture together --- it helps
hackers recognize each other's places in the community and expresses shared
values and experiences. Also as usual, *not* knowing the slang (or using it
inappropriately) defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in
hackish vocabulary) possibly even a *suit*. All human cultures use slang in
this threefold way --- as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and of
exclusion. Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect paralleled
perhaps in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but
hard to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are code
for shared states of *consciousness*. There is a whole range of altered
states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level hacking which
don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a Coltrane
solo or one of Maurits Escher's trick-the-eye paintings (Escher is a favorite
of hackers), and hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious
ways. Take the distinction between a {kluge} and an {elegant} solution, and
the differing connotations attached to each, as a simple example. The
distinction is not only of engineering significance; it reaches right back
into the nature of the generative processes in program design and asserts
something important about two different kinds of relationship between the
hacker and the hack. Hacker slang is unusually rich in implications of this
kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche. But
there is more. Hackers, as a rule, love word-play and are very conscious and
inventive in their use of language. These traits are common in children, but
the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an educational system
bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence. Thus, linguistic
invention in most subcultures of ours is a halting and largely unconscious
process. Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a game to be
played for conscious pleasure. Their inventions thus display an almost unique
combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the
discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence. Further, the electronic
media which knit them together are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to
both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and
superannuated specimens. The results of this process give us perhaps a
uniquely intense ans accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action. The
intensity and consciousness of hackish invention makes a compilation of
hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding culture ---
and, in fact, this one is the latest version of an evolving compilation
called the `Jargon File' maintained by hackers themselves for over fifteen
years. This one (like its ancestors) is primarily a lexicon, but also
includes `topic entries' which collect background or sidelight information on
hacker culture that would be awkward to try to subsume under individual
entries. Though the format is that of a reference, it is also intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse or read straight through. Even a complete
outsider should find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that
is amusingly thought-provoking. But it is also true that hackers use humorous
word-play to make strong, sometime combative statements about what they feel.
Some of these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in disputes that
have been genuinely passionate; this is deliberate. We have not tried to
moderate or pretty up these disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that
*everyone's* sacred cows get gored, impartially. Compromise is not
particularly a hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent
viewpoints is. The reader with minimal computer background who finds some
references incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them. We have not
felt it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
(fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture) will benefit from
them. A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor are included
in Appendix A. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly directed to
Appendix B, the Portrait of J. Random Hacker. Appendix C is a bibliography of
non-technical works which have either influenced or described the hacker
culture. Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual
must choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between description and influence can become more than a little blurred.
Earlier Jargon File versions have played a central role in spreading hacker
language and the culture that goes with it to successively larger
populations, and we hope and expect that this one will do likewise. Of Slang,
Jargon, and Techspeak =============================== Linguists usually refer
to informal language as `slang' and reserve the term `jargon' for the
technical vocabularies of various occupations. However, the ancestor of this
collection was called the `Jargon File' and hackish slang is traditionally
`the jargon'. When talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient
way to distinguish what a *linguist* would call hackers' jargon --- the
formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers, and manuals.
To make a confused situation worse, the line between hackish slang and
technical programming and computer science vocabulary is fuzzy, and shifts
over time. Further, this technical vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do not
speak or recognize hackish slang. Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as
precise as the facts of usage permit about the distinctions between three
categories: * `slang': informal language from mainstream English or
non-techical subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc.). * `jargon':
without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language peculiar to hackers ---
the subject of this lexicon. * `techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary
of programming, computer science, electronics, and other fields connected to
hacking. This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder
of this lexicon. The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one. A lot
of techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing uptake of
jargon into techspeak. On the other hand, a lot of jargon arises from
overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about this in the
`Jargon Construction' section below). In general, we have considered
techspeak any term which communicates primarily by a denotation well
established in textbooks, technical dictionaries, or standards documents. A
few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages or
documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that isn't
covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical historical
background necessary to understand other entries to which they are
cross-referenced. Some other techspeak senses of jargon words have been
listed in order to make the jargon senses clear; where the text does not
specify that a straight technical sense is under discussion, these are marked
with `[techspeak]' as an etymology. Many entries have a sense #1 marked this
way, with subsequent jargon meanings explained in terms of it. Revision
History ================ The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker
jargon from technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities, Bolt Beranek and Newman
(BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(WPI). The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')
was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975, though some terms in it date
back considerably earlier ({frob} and some senses of {moby}, for instance, go
back to the Tech Model Railroad Club and MIT and are believed to date at
least back to the early 1960s). The revisions of jargon-1 were all unnumbered
and may be collectively considered `Version 1'. In 1976, Mark Crispin brought
the File to MIT; he and Guy Steele then added a first wave of new entries.
Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter, and
Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently kept
in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic re-synchronizations). The File
expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman was prominent
among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related coinages. A late
version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass market, was edited
by Guy L. Steele into a book published in 1983 as `The Hacker's Dictionary'
(Harper & Row CN 1082, ISBN 0-06-091082-8). The other jargon-1 editors
(Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and Mark Crispin) contributed to the revision, as
did Richard M. Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow. This book is hereafter referred
to as `Steele-1983'. It is now out of print. Shortly after the publication of
Steele-1983, the File effectively stopped growing and changing. The
PDP-10-centered cultures that had originally nourished it were dealt a
serious blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at DEC; at the same
time, the commercialization of AI technology lured some of their best and
brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in Massachusetts and in
Silicon Valley. The AI-Lab culture died and its members dispersed; the File's
compilers moved on to other things. By the mid-1980s the File's content was
dated, but the legend that had grown up around it never quite died out. The
book, and softcopies obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures
far removed from MIT's and Stanford's; the content exerted a strong and
continuing influence on hackish language and humor. Even as the advent of the
microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom,
the File (and related materials like the AI Koans in Appendix A) came to be
seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture Matter of Britain chronicling
the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab. The pace of change in
hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously, but the Jargon File passed from
living document to icon and remained essentially untouched for seven years.
This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of jargon-1
(a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries have been dropped following careful
consultation with the editors of Steele-1983). It merges in about about 80%
of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very few
entries introduced in Steele-1983 which are now also obsolete. This new
version casts a wider net than the old jargon file; its aim is to cover not
just AI but all the technical computing cultures wherein the true
hacker-nature is manifested. More than half of the entries now derive from
USENET and represent jargon now current in the C and UNIX communities, but
special efforts have been made to collect jargon from other cultures
including IBM-PC programmers, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe
world. Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known
to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate. Here is a list of
abbreviations used in etymologies: Berkeley University of California at
Berkeley Cambridge The university in England (*not* the city in Massachusetts
where MIT happens to be located!)
