see also {fritterware}, {window shopping}. :machinable: adj.
Machine-readable. Having the {softcopy} nature. :machoflops: /mach'oh-flops/
n. [pun on `megaflops', a coinage for `millions of FLoating-point Operations
Per Second'] Refers to artificially inflated performance figures often quoted
by computer manufacturers. Real applications are lucky to get half the quoted
speed. see {Your mileage may vary}, {benchmark}. :Macintoy: /mak'in-toy/ n.
The Apple Macintosh, considered as a {toy}. Less pejorative than
{Macintrash}. :Macintrash: /mak'in-trash`/ n. The Apple Macintosh, as
described by a hacker who doesn't appreciate being kept away from the _real
computer_ by the interface. The term {maggotbox} has been reported in regular
use in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. Compare {Macintoy}. see
also {beige toaster}, {WIMP environment}, {point-and-drool interface},
{drool-proof paper}, {user-friendly}. :macro: /mak'roh/ n. [techspeak] A name
(possibly followed by a formal {arg} list) that is equated to a text or
symbolic expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the
substitution of actual arguments) by a macro expander. This definition can be
found in any technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the
hackish connotations of the term have changed over time. The term `macro'
originated in early assemblers, which encouraged the use of macros as a
structuring and information-hiding device. During the early 1970s, macro
assemblers became ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive
as {HLL}s, only to fall from favor as improving compiler technology
marginalized assembler programming (see {languages of choice}). Nowadays the
term is most often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one
of several special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion facility
(such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff suite). Indeed, the meaning has drifted
enough that the collective `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any
special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language is
actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such as
the `keyboard macros' supported in some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh
INIT/CDEV keyboard enhancers). :macro-: pref. Large. Opposite of {micro-}. In
the mainstream and among other technical cultures (for example, medical
people) this competes with the prefix {mega-}, but hackers tend to restrict
the latter to quantification. :macrology: /mak-rol'*-jee/ n. 1. Set of
usually complex or crufty macros, e.g., as part of a large system written in
{LISP}, {TECO}, or (less commonly) assembler. 2. The art and science involved
in comprehending a macrology in sense 1. Sometimes studying the macrology of
a system is not unlike archeology, ecology, or {theology}, hence the
sound-alike construction. see also {boxology}. :macrotape: /mak'roh-tayp/ n.
An industry-standard reel of tape. Originally, as opposed to a DEC microtape;
nowadays, as opposed to modern
