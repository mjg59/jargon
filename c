 C n. 1. The third letter of the Latin alphabet. 2. The name of a programming
language designed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s and first used to
implement UNIX (q.v.). So called because many features derived from an
earlier interpreter named 'B' in commemoration of *its* parent, BCPL; before
Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing C++, there was a humorous
debate over whether C's successor should be named `D' or `P'. C became
immensely popular outside Bell Labs after about 1980 and is now the dominant
language in systems and microcomputer applications programming. see LANGUAGES
