 :sleep: vi. 1. [techspeak] On a timesharing system, a process that
relinquishes its claim on the scheduler until some given event occurs or a
specified time delay elapses is said to `go to sleep'. 2. In jargon, used
very similarly to v. {block}; also in `sleep on', syn. with `block on'. Often
used to indicate that the speaker has relinquished a demand for resources
until some (possibly unspecified) external event: "They can't get the fix
I've been asking for into the next release, so I'm going to sleep on it until
the release, then start hassling them again."
