 :sleep: /vi./ 1. [techspeak] To relinquish a claim (of a process on a
multitasking system) for service; to indicate to the scheduler that a process
may be deactivated until some given event occurs or a specified time delay
elapses. 2. In jargon, used very similarly to /v./ {block}; also in `sleep
on', syn. with `block on'. Often used to indicate that the speaker has
relinquished a demand for resources until some (possibly unspecified)
external event: "They can't get the fix I've been asking for into the next
release, so I'm going to sleep on it until the release, then start hassling
them again."
