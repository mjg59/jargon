 :gonzo: /gonÂ´zoh/, adj. [from Hunter S. Thompson] 1. With total commitment,
total concentration, and a mad sort of panache. (Thompson's original sense.)
2. More loosely: Overwhelming; outrageous; over the top; very large, esp.
used of collections of source code, source files, or individual functions.
Has some of the connotations of {moby} and {hairy}, but without the
implication of obscurity or complexity.
