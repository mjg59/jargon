 :FAQ: /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ [USENET] n. 1. A Frequently Asked Question. 2. A
compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically to high-volume newsgroups
in an attempt to forestall such questions. Some people prefer the term `FAQ
list' or `FAQL' /fa'kl/, reserving `FAQ' for sense 1. This lexicon itself
serves as a good example of a collection of one kind of lore, although it is
far too big for a regular FAQ posting. Examples: "What is the proper type of
NULL?" and "What's that funny name for the `#' character?" are both
Frequently Asked Questions. Several FAQs refer readers to this file.
