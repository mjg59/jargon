 MICROTAPE n. Occasionally used to mean a DECtape, as opposed to a MACROTAPE.
A DECtape is a small reel of magnetic tape about four inches in diameter and
an inch wide. Unlike standard magnetic tapes, microtapes allow "random
access" to the data. In their heyday they were used in pretty much the same
ways one would now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save and
transport files and programs. Apparently the term "microtape" was actually
the official term used within DEC for these tapes until someone consed up
[invented] the word "DECtape", which of course had more commercial appeal.
