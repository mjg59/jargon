 :microtape: /mi:'kroh-tayp/ n. Occasionally used to mean a DECtape, as
opposed to a {macrotape}. A DECtape is a small reel, about 4 inches in
diameter, of magnetic tape about an inch wide. Unlike drivers for today's
{macrotape}s, microtape drivers allow random access to the data, and
therefore could be used to support file systems and even for swapping (this
was generally done purely for {hack value}, as they were far too slow for
practical use). In their heyday they were used in pretty much the same ways
one would now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save and
transport files and programs. Apparently the term `microtape' was actually
the official term used within DEC for these tapes until someone coined the
word `DECtape', which, of course, sounded sexier to the {marketroid}s;
another version of the story holds that someone discovered a conflict with
another company's `microtape' trademark.
