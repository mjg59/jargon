 FUBAR: n. The Failed UniBus Address Register in a VAX. A good example of how
jargon can occasionally be snuck past the {suit}s; see {foobar}. fuck me
harder: excl. Sometimes uttered in response to egregious misbehavior, esp. in
software, and esp. of those which seem unfairly persistent (as though
designed in by the imp of the perverse). Often theatrically elaborated:
"Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver and sixteen feet of curare-tipped
wrought-iron fence *and no lubricants!*" The phrase is sometimes heard
abbreviated FMH in polite company.
