 :noddy: /nod'ee/ adj. [UK: from the children's books] 1. Small and
un-useful, but demonstrating a point. Noddy programs are often written by
people learning a new language or system. The archetypal noddy program is
{hello, world}. Noddy code may be used to demonstrate a feature or bug of a
compiler. May be used of real hardware or software to imply that it isn't
worth using. "This editor's a bit noddy." 2. A program that is more or less
instant to produce. In this use, the term does not necessarily connote
uselessness, but describes a {hack} sufficiently trivial that it can be
written and debugged while carrying on (and during the space of) a normal
conversation. "I'll just throw together a noddy {awk} script to dump all the
first fields." In North America this might be called a {mickey mouse
program}. see {toy program}.
