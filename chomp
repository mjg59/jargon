 CHOMP vt. To lose; to chew on something of which more was bitten off than
one can. Probably related to gnashing of teeth. see BAGBITER. A hand gesture
commonly accompanies this, consisting of the four fingers held together as if
in a mitten or hand puppet, and the fingers and thumb open and close rapidly
to illustrate a biting action (much like what the PacMan does in the classic
video game, though this pantomime seems to predate that). The gesture alone
means CHOMP CHOMP (see Verb Doubling). The hand may be pointed at the object
of complaint, and for real emphasis you can use both hands at once. For
example, to do this to a person is equivalent to saying "You chomper!" If you
point the gesture at yourself, it is a humble but humorous admission of some
failure. You might do this if someone told you that a program you had written
had failed in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having
anticipated it.
