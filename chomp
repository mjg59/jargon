 :chomp: vi. 1. To {lose}; specifically, to chew on something of which more
was bitten off than one can. Probably related to gnashing of teeth. 2. To
bite the bag; see {bagbiter}. A hand gesture commonly accompanies this. To
perform it, hold the four fingers together and place the thumb against their
tips. Now open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this pantomime seems
to predate that). The gesture alone means `chomp chomp' (see Verb Doubling in
the Jargon Construction section of the Prependices). The hand may be pointed
at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis you can use both hands at
once. Doing this to a person is equivalent to saying "You chomper!" If you
point the gesture at yourself, it is a humble but humorous admission of some
failure. You might do this if someone told you that a program you had written
had failed in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having
anticipated it.
