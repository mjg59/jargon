 :TMRC: /tmerk'/ n. The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the
wellsprings of hacker culture. The 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language"
compiled by Peter Samson included several terms that became basics of the
hackish vocabulary (see esp. {foo}, {mung}, and {frob}). By 1962, TMRC's
legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity and has grown in the
years since. All the features described here were still present when the old
layout was decomissioned in 1998 just before the demolition of MIT Building
20, and will almost certainly be retained when the old layout is rebuilt
(expected in 2003). The control system alone featured about 1200 relays.
There were {scram switch}es located at numerous places around the room that
could be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a
train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a
digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder
in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays. When
someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced
with the word `FOO'; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore called `foo
switches'. Steven Levy, in his book "Hackers" (see the {Bibliography} in
Appendix C), gives a stimulating account of those early years. TMRC's Signals
and Power Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people
who later became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff. Thirty years later that
connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes a
number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary. TMRC has a
web page at `http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/'. The TMRC Dictionary is available
there, at `http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html'.
