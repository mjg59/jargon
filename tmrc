 :TMRC: /tmerk'/ n. The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the
wellsprings of hacker culture. The 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language"
compiled by Peter Samson included several terms that became basics of the
hackish vocabulary (see esp. {foo}, {mung}, and {frob}). By 1962, TMRC's
legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity (and has grown in the
thirty years since; all the features described here are still present). The
control system alone featured about 1200 relays. There were {scram switch}es
located at numerous places around the room that could be thwacked if
something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going full-bore at
an obstruction. Another feature of the system was a digital clock on the
dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder in those bygone days
before cheap LEDS and seven-segment displays. When someone hit a scram switch
the clock stopped and the display was replaced with the word `FOO'; at TMRC
the scram switches are therefore called `foo switches'. Steven Levy, in his
book "Hackers" (see the {Bibliography} in Appendix C), gives a stimulating
account of those early years. TMRC's Power and Signals group included most of
the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later bacame the core of the MIT
AI Lab staff. Thirty years later that connection is still very much alive,
and this lexicon accordingly includes a number of entries from a recent
revision of the TMRC dictionary.
