 :bread crumbs: n. Debugging statements inserted into a program that emit
output or log indicators of the program's {state} to a file so you can see
where it dies, or pin down the cause of surprising behavior. The term is
probably a reference to the Hansel and Gretel story from the Brothers Grimm;
in several variants, a character leaves a trail of bread crumbs so as not to
get lost in the woods.
