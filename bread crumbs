 :bread crumbs: n. 1. Debugging statements inserted into a program that emit
output or log indicators of the program's {state} to a file so you can see
where it dies or pin down the cause of surprising behavior. The term is
probably a reference to the Hansel and Gretel story from the Brothers Grimm
or the older French folktale of Thumbelina; in several variants of these, a
character leaves a trail of bread crumbs so as not to get lost in the woods.
2. In user-interface design, any feature that allows some tracking of where
you've been, like coloring visited links purple rather than blue in Netscape
(also called `footprinting').
