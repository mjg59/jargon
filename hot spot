 :hot spot: n. 1. [primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but spreading] It is
received wisdom that in most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90% of
the execution time; if one were to graph instruction visits versus code
addresses, one would typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of
low-level noise. Such spikes are called `hot spots' and are good candidates
for heavy optimization or {hand-hacking}. The term is especially used of
tight loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as opposed to
(say) initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O operations. see
{tune}, {bum}, {hand-hacking}. 2. The active location of a cursor on a
bit-map display. "Put the mouse's hot spot on the `ON' widget and click the
left button." 3. A screen region that is sensitive to mouse gestures, which
trigger some action. World Wide Web pages now provide the {canonical}
examples; WWW browsers present hypertext links as hot spots which, when
clicked on, point the browser at another document (these are specifically
called {hotlink}s). 4. In a massively parallel computer with shared memory,
the one location that all 10,000 processors are trying to read or write at
once (perhaps because they are all doing a {busy-wait} on the same lock). 5.
More generally, any place in a hardware design that turns into a performance
bottleneck due to resource contention.
