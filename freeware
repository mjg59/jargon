 :freeware: n. [common] Freely-redistributable software, often written by
enthusiasts and distributed by users' groups, or via electronic mail, local
bulletin boards, {Usenet}, or other electronic media. As the culture of the
Internet has displaced the older BBS world, this term has lost ground to both
{open source} and {free software}; it has increasingly tended to be
restricted to software distributed in binary rather than source-code form. At
one time, `freeware' was a trademark of Andrew Fluegelman, the author of the
well-known MS-DOS comm program PC-TALK III. It wasn't enforced after his
mysterious disappearance and presumed death in 1984. see {shareware}, {FRS}.
