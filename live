 :live: /li:v/ /adj.,adv./ Opposite of `test'. Refers to actual real-world
data or a program working with it. For example, the response to "I think the
record deleter is finished." might be "Is it live yet?" "Have you tried it
out on live data?" This usage usually carries the connotation that live data
is more fragile and must not be corrupted, or bad things will happen. So a
more appropriate response might be: "Well, make sure it works perfectly
before we throw live data at it." The implication here is that record
deletion is something pretty significant, and a haywire record-deleter
running amok live would probably cause great harm.
