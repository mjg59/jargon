 :baz: /baz/ /n./ 1. The third {metasyntactic variable} "Suppose we have
three functions: FOO, BAR, and BAZ. FOO calls BAR, which calls BAZ...." (see
also {fum}) 2. /interj./ A term of mild annoyance. In this usage the term is
often drawn out for 2 or 3 seconds, producing an effect not unlike the
bleating of a sheep; /baaaaaaz/. 3. Occasionally appended to {foo} to produce
`foobaz'. Earlier versions of this lexicon derived `baz' as a Stanford
corruption of {bar}. However, Pete Samson (compiler of the {TMRC} lexicon)
reports it was already current when he joined TMRC in 1958. He says "It came
from "Pogo". Albert the Alligator, when vexed or outraged, would shout `Bazz
Fazz!' or `Rowrbazzle!' The club layout was said to model the (mythical) New
England counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with
(Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex)."
