 :Pentium: n. The name given to Intel's P5 chip, the successor to the 80486.
The name was chosen because of difficulties Intel had in trademarking a
number. It suggests the number five (implying 586) while (according to Intel)
conveying a meaning of strength "like titanium". Among hackers, the plural is
frequently `pentia'. see also {Pentagram Pro}. Intel did not stick to this
convention when naming its P6 processor the Pentium Pro; many believe this is
due to difficulties in selling a chip with "hex" or "sex" in its name.
Successor chips have been called `Pentium II', `Pentium III', and `Pentium
IV'.
