 :glob: /glob/, *not* /glohb/ [UNIX] vt.,n. To expand special characters in a
wildcarded name, or the act of so doing (the action is also called
`globbing'). The UNIX conventions for filename wildcarding have become
sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use some of them in written English,
especially in email or news on technical topics. Those commonly encountered
include the following: * wildcard for any string (see also {UN*X}) ? wildcard
for any character (generally read this way only at the beginning or in the
middle of a word) [] delimits a wildcard matching any of the enclosed
characters {} alternation of comma-separated alternatives; thus,
`foo{baz,qux}' would be read as `foobaz' or `fooqux' Some examples: "He said
his name was [KC]arl" (expresses ambiguity). "I don't read talk.politics.*"
(any of the talk.politics subgroups on {USENET}). Other examples are given
under the entry for {X}. Compare {regexp}. Historical note: The jargon usage
derives from `glob', the name of a subprogram that expanded wildcards in
archaic pre-Bourne versions of the UNIX shell.
