 GLOB [UNIX, from "glob", the name of a subprogram that translated wildcards
in archaic Bourne Shell versions] n.,v. The UNIX conventions for filename
wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use some of
them in written English, especially in email or news on technical topics.
Those commonly encountered include: * wildcard for any string (see UN*X,
U*IX). ? wildcard for any character (generally only read this way in the
middle of a word. [] set-of-characters braces. Some examples: "He said his
name was [KC]arl" (expresses ambiguity). "That got posted to talk.politics.*"
(all the talk.politics subgroups on USENET). Other examples are given under
the entry for `X'. GLOB as a noun refers to the act of expanding a string
using these conventions. It is also used as a verb.
