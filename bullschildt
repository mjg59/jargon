 :bullschildt: /bul'shilt/ n. [comp.lang.c on USENET] A confident, but
incorrect, statement about a programming language. This immortalizes a very
bad book about {C}, Herbert Schildt's "C - The Complete Reference". One
reviewer commented "The naive errors in this book would be embarassing even
in a programming assignment turned in by a computer science college
sophomore."
