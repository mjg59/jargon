 :bullschildt: /bulÂ´shilt/, n. [comp.lang.c on USENET] A confident, but
incorrect, statement about a programming language. This immortalizes a very
bad book about {C}, Herbert Schildt's C - The Complete Reference. One
reviewer commented "The naive errors in this book would be embarrassing even
in a programming assignment turned in by a computer science college
sophomore."
