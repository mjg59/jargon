 DROOL-PROOF PAPER n. Documentation which has been obsessively dumbed down,
to the point where only a CRETIN could bear to read it, is said to have
succumbed to the "drool-proof paper syndrome" or to have been "written on
drool-proof paper". For example, this is an actual quote from Apple's
LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your LaserWriter to open fire or flame."
