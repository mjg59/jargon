 :drool-proof paper: n. Documentation that has been obsessively {dumbed
down}, to the point where only a {cretin} could bear to read it, is said to
have succumbed to the `drool-proof paper syndrome' or to have been `written
on drool-proof paper'. For example, this is an actual quote from Apple's
LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your LaserWriter to open fire or flame."
The SGI Indy manual included the line "[Do not] dangle the mouse by the cord
or throw it at coworkers."
