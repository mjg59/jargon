 :WOMBAT: [Waste Of Money, Brains, And Time] adj. Applied to problems which
are both profoundly {uninteresting} in themselves and unlikely to benefit
anyone interesting even if solved. Often used in fanciful constructions such
as `wrestling with a wombat'. see also {crawling horror}, {SMOP}. Also note
the rather different usage as a metasyntactic variable in {{Commonwealth
Hackish}}.
