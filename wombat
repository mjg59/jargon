 :WOMBAT: /womÂ´bat/, adj. [acronym: Waste Of Money, Brains, And Time] Applied
to problems which are both profoundly {uninteresting} in themselves and
unlikely to benefit anyone interesting even if solved. Often used in fanciful
constructions such as wrestling with a wombat. see also {crawling horror},
{SMOP}. Also note the rather different usage as a metasyntactic variable in
{Commonwealth Hackish}. Users of the {PDP-11} database program DATATRIEVE
adopted the wombat as their notional mascot; the program's help file
responded to "HELP WOMBAT" with factual information about Real World wombats.
