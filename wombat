 WIMP environment: n. [acronymic from Window, Icon, Menu, Pointing Device] A
graphical-user-interface-based environment, as described by a hacker who
prefers command-line interfaces for their superior flexibility and
extensibility. win: [from MIT jargon] 1. vi. To succeed. A program wins if no
unexpected conditions arise. 2. Success, or a specific instance thereof. A
pleasing outcome. A {feature}. 3. `big win': n. Serendipity. Emphatic forms:
`moby win', `super win', `hyper-win' (often used interjectively as a reply).
For some reason `suitable win' is also common at MIT, usually in reference to
a satisfactory solution to a problem. Oppose {lose}. win big: vi. To
experience serendipity. "I went shopping and won big; there was a two-for-one
sale." win win: interj. Expresses pleasure at a {win}. Winchester:: n.
Informal term for the now-standard `floating-head' magnetic-disk technology
in which the read-write head planes over the disk surface on an air cushion.
The name arose because the original 1973 engineering prototype for what later
became the IBM 3340 featured two 30-megabyte volumes; 30-30 became
`Winchester' when somebody noticed the similarity to the common term for a
famous Winchester rifle (in the latter, the first 30 referred to caliber and
the second to the grain weight of the charge). winged comments: n. Comments
set on the same line as code, as opposed to {box comments}. In C, for
example: d = sqrt(x*x + y*y); /* d = distance of (x,y) from origin */
Generally these refer only to the action(s) taken on that line. winnage:
/win'@j/ n. The situation when a lossage is corrected, or when something is
winning. Quite rare. Usage: also quite rare. winner: 1. n. An unexpectedly
good situation, program, programmer or person. 2. `real winner': Often
sarcastic, but also used as high praise. winnitude: /win'i-tood/ n. The
quality of winning (as opposed to {winnage}, which is the result of winning).
"That's really great! Boy, what winnitude!" wired: n. see {hardwired}.
wirehead: n. [prob. from notional SF slang for an electrical brain
stimulation junkie] 1. A hardware hacker, especially one who concentrates on
communications hardware. 2. An expert in local-area networks. A wirehead can
be a network software wizard too, but will always have the ability to deal
with network hardware, down to the smallest component. Wireheads are known
for their ability to lash up an Ethernet terminator from spare resistors, for
example. wish list: n. A list of desired features or bug fixes that probably
won't get done for a long time, usually because the person responsible for
the code is too busy or can't think of a clean way to do it. wizard: n. 1. A
person who knows how a complex piece of software or hardware works (that is,
who {grok}s it); esp. someone who can find and fix bugs quickly in an
emergency. This term differs somewhat from {hacker}. Someone is a hacker if
he has general hacking ability, but is only a wizard with respect to
something if he has specific detailed knowledge of that thing. A good hacker
could become a wizard for something given the time to study it. 2. A person
who is permitted to do things forbidden to ordinary people. For example, an
Adventure wizard at Stanford may play the Adventure game during the day,
which is forbidden (the program simply refuses to play) to most people
because it consumes too many {cycle}s. 3. A UNIX expert, esp. a UNIX systems
programmer. This usage is well enough established that `UNIX Wizard' is a
recognized job title at some corporations and to most headhunters. see
{guru}. wizard book: n. Abelson and Sussman's `Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs', an excellent CS text used in introductory courses at
MIT. So called because of the wizard on the cover of the MIT Press edition.
wizard mode: [from nethack] n. A special access mode of a program or system,
usually passworded, that permits some users godlike privileges. Generally not
used for operating systems themselves ('root mode' or `wheel mode' would be
used instead). wizardly: adj. Pertaining to wizards. A wizardly {feature} is
one that only a wizard could understand or use properly. WOMBAT: [Waste Of
Money, Brains, And Time] adj. Applied to problems which are both profoundly
{uninteresting} in themselves and unlikely to benefit anyone interesting even
if solved. Often used in fanciful constructions such as `wrestling with a
wombat'. see also {crawling horror}, {SMOP}. Also note the rather different
usage as a meta-syntactic variable under {{Commonwealth Hackish}} wonky:
/wong'kee/ [from Australian slang] adj. Yet another approximate synonym for
{broken}. Specifically connotes a malfunction which produces behavior seen as
crazy, humorous, or amusingly perverse. "That was the day the printer's font
logic went wonky and everybody's listings came out in Elvish." Also in
`wonked out'. see {funky}, {demented}. workaround: n. A temporary {kluge}
inserted in a system under development or test in order to avoid the effects
of a {bug} or {misfeature} so that work can continue. Theoretically,
workarounds are always replaced by {fix}es; in practice, customers often find
themselves living with workarounds in the first couple of releases. "The code
died on nul characters in the input, so I fixed it to abort with an error
message when it sees one." "That's not a fix, that's a workaround!" working
as designed: [IBM] adj. 1. In conformance to a wrong or inappropriate
specification; useful, but mis-designed. 2. Frequently used as a sardonic
comment on a program's utility. 3. Unfortunately also as a bogus reason for
not accepting a criticism or suggestion. At {IBM}, this sense is used in
official documents! see {BAD}. worm: [from `tapeworm' in John Brunner's `The
Shockwave Rider', via XEROX PARC] n. A program that propagates itself over a
network, reproducing itself as it goes. Compare {virus}. Nowadays the term
has negative connotations, as it is assumed that only crackers write worms.
Perhaps the best known example was Robert T. Morris's `Internet Worm' in
1988, a `benign' one that got out of control and hogged hundreds of Suns and
VAXen nationwide. see also {cracker}, {Trojan horse}, {ice}. wound around the
axle: adj. In an infinite loop. Often used by older computer types. wow: see
{bang}. wrap around: vi. (also n. `wraparound' and v. shorthand `wrap') 1.
This is jargon in its normal computer usage, i.e., describing the action of a
counter that starts over at 0 or at `minus infinity' after its maximum value
has been reached, and continues incrementing, either because it is programmed
to do so, or because of an overflow like a car's odometer starting over at 0.
2. To change {phase} gradually and continuously by maintaining a steady
wake-sleep cycle somewhat longer than 24 hours, e.g. living 6 long (28-hour)
days in a week. write-only code: [a play on `read-only memory'] n. Code
sufficiently arcane, complex, or ill-structured that it cannot be modified or
even comprehended by anyone but the original author, and possibly not even by
him/her. A {Bad Thing}. write-only language: n. A language with syntax (or
semantics) sufficiently dense and bizarre that any routine of significant
size is {write-only code}. A sobriquet often applied to APL, though
{INTERCAL} and {TECO} certainly deserve it more. write-only memory: n. The
obvious antonym to `read-only memory'. In frustration with the long and
seemingly useless chain of approvals required of component specifications,
during which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics
created a specification for a write-only memory, and included it with a bunch
of other specifications to be approved. This inclusion only came to the
attention of Signetics when regular customers started calling and asking for
pricing information. Signetics published a corrected edition of the data book
and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones. Later, about 1974,
Signetics bought a double page spread in Electronics magazine's April issue
and used the spec as an April Fools' day joke. Instead of the more
conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N,
Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included diagrams of "bit
capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining vs. number of
socket insertions" and "AQL vs. selling price". The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC
VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%. Wrong Thing: n. A design,
action or decision which is clearly incorrect or inappropriate. Often
capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if capitalized. The opposite of
the Right Thing; more generally, anything that is not the Right Thing. In
cases where `the good is the enemy of the best', the merely good, while good,
is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. wugga wugga: /wuh'g@ wuh'g@/ n. Imaginary
sound that a computer program makes as it labors with a tedious or difficult
task. Compare {cruncha cruncha cruncha}, {grind} (sense #4).
