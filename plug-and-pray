 :plug-and-pray: adj.,vi. Parody of the techspeak term `plug-and-play',
describing a PC peripheral card which is claimed to have no need for hardware
configuration via DIP switches, and which should work as soon as it is
inserted in the PC. Unfortunately, even the PCI bus is not up to pulling this
off reliably, and people who have to do installation or troubleshoot PCs soon
find themselves longing for the DIP switches.
