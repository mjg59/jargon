 :cookbook: /n./ [from amateur electronics and radio] A book of small code
segments that the reader can use to do various {magic} things in programs.
One current example is the "{{PostScript}} Language Tutorial and Cookbook" by
Adobe Systems, Inc (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10179-3), also known as the
{Blue Book} which has recipes for things like wrapping text around arbitrary
curves and making 3D fonts. Cookbooks, slavishly followed, can lead one into
{voodoo programming}, but are useful for hackers trying to {monkey up} small
programs in unknown languages. This function is analogous to the role of
phrasebooks in human languages.
