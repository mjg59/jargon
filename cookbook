 :cookbook: n. [from amateur electronics and radio] A book of small code
segments that the reader can use to do various {magic} things in programs.
Cookbooks, slavishly followed, can lead one into {voodoo programming}, but
are useful for hackers trying to {monkey up} small programs in unknown
languages. This function is analogous to the role of phrasebooks in human
languages.
