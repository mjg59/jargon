 COME FROM: n. A semi-mythical language construct dual to the `go to'; COME
FROM <label> would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly and
{automagically} be transferred to the statement following the COME FROM. COME
FROM was first proposed in a {Datamation} article of December 1973 (reprinted
in the April 1984 issue of Communications of the ACM) that parodied the
then-raging `structured programming' {holy wars} (see {considered harmful}).
Mythically, some variants are the `assigned come from', and the `computed
come from' (parodying some nasty control constructs in FORTRAN and some
extended BASICs). Obviously, multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be
implemented by having more than one COME FROM statement coming from the same
label. In some ways the FORTRAN DO looks like a COME FROM statement. After
the terminating label/CONTINUE is reached, control continues at the statement
following the DO. Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements
(other than CONTINUE) for the label, leading to examples like this DO 10
I=1,LIMIT C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the original DO C
statement lost in the spaghetti... WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I) 10
FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4) in which the trapdoor is just after the statement
labelled 10. (This is particularly surprising because the label doesn't
appear to have anything to do with the flow of control at all!) While
sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of COME FROM
statement isn't completely general. After all, control will eventually pass
to the following statement. The implementation of the general form was left
to Univac FORTRAN, ca.1975. The statement `AT 100' would perform a `COME FROM
100'. It was intended strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences
promised to anyone so deranged as to use it in production code. More horrible
things had already been perpetrated in production languages, however;
doubters need only contemplate COBOL's `ALTER' verb. COME FROM was supported
under its own name for the first time fifteen years later, in C-INTERCAL (see
{INTERCAL}, {retrocomputing}); knowledgeable observers are still reeling from
shock. comm mode: /kom mohd/ [from the ITS feature supporting on-line chat,
spelled with one or two Ms] Syn. for {talk mode}. command key: [Mac users] n.
The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf graphic on its keytop; sometimes
referred to as `flower', `pretzel', `clover', `propeller', or `beanie' (an
apparent reference to the propeller on a beanie). The Mac's equivalent to an
{ALT} key. comment out: vt. To surround a section of code with comment
delimiters or to prefix every line in the section with a comment marker; this
prevents it from being compiled or interpreted. Often done when the code is
redundant or obsolete, but you want to leave it in the source to make the
intent of the active code clearer; also when the code in that section is
broken and you want to bypass it in order to debug some other part of the
code. Compare {condition out}, usually the preferred technique in languages
(like {C}) that make it possible. Commonwealth Hackish:: n. Hacker jargon as
spoken outside the U.S., esp. in the British Commonwealth. It is reported
that Commonwealth speakers are more likely to pronounce `char', `soc', etc.
as spelled (/char/, /sok/) as opposed to American /keir/ or /sohsh/. Dots in
{newsgroup} names tend to be pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot
wi'bble/ rather than /sohsh wib'ble/). The prefix {meta} may be pronounced
/mee't*-/; similarly, Greek letter beta is often /bee't*/, zeta is often
/zee't*/ and so forth. Preferred metasyntactic variables include EEK, OOK,
FRODO, and BILBO; WIBBLE, WOBBLE, and in emergencies WUBBLE; BANANA, WOMBAT,
FROG, {fish}, and so on and on (see {foo}, sense #4). Alternatives to verb
doubling include suffixes `-o-rama', `frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy) and
`city' (as in "barf city!" "hack-o-rama!" "core dump frenzy!"). Finally, note
that the American terms `parens', `brackets', and `braces' for (), [], and {}
are uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers `brackets', `square brackets', and
`curly brackets'. Also, the use of `pling' for {bang} is common outside the
United States. see also {attoparsec}, {calculator}, {chemist}, {console
jockey}, {fish}, {grunge}, {hakspek}, {heavy metal}, {leaky heap}, {lord high
fixer}, {noddy}, {psychedelicware}, {plingnet}, {raster blaster}, {seggie},
{terminal junkie}, {tick-list features}, {weeble}, {weasel}, {YABA}, and
notes or definitions under {Bad Thing}, {barf}, {bogus}, {bum}, {chase
pointers}, {cosmic rays}, {crippleware}, {crunch}, {dodgy}, {gonk},
{mess-dos}, {nybble}, {proglet}, {root}, {tweak}, and {xyzzy}. compact: adj.
Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all be apprehended
at once in one's head. This generally means the thing created from the design
can be used with greater facility and fewer errors than an equivalent tool
that is not compact. Note that compactness does not imply triviality or lack
of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is more
powerful than FORTRAN. Designs become non-compact through accreting
{feature}s and {cruft} that don't merge cleanly into the overall design
scheme. compress: [UNIX] vt. When used without a qualifier, generally refers
to {crunch}ing of a file using a particular C implementation of Lempel-Ziv
compression by James A. Woods et al. and widely circulated via {USENET}. Use
of {crunch} itself in this sense is rare among UNIX hackers. computer
confetti: n. Syn. {chad}. Though this term is common, this use of the
punched-card chad is not a good idea, as the pieces are stiff and have sharp
corners that could injure the eyes. GLS reports that he once attended a
wedding at MIT during which he and a few other guests enthusiastically threw
chad instead of rice. The groom later grumbled that he and his bride had
spent most of the evening trying to get the stuff out of their hair. computer
geek: n. One who eats (computer) bugs for a living. One who fulfills all of
the dreariest negative stereotypes about hackers: an asocial, malodorous,
pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a cheese grater. Cannot be
used by outsiders without implied insult to all hackers; compare
black-on-black usage of `nigger'. A computer geek may be either a
fundamentally clueless individual or a proto-hacker in {larval stage}. Also
called `turbo nerd', `turbo geek'. see also {clustergeeking}, {wannabee},
{terminal junkie}. computron: /kom'pyoo-tron`/ n. 1. A notional unit of
computing power combining instruction speed and storage capacity, dimensioned
roughly in instructions-per-second times megabytes-of-main-store times
megabytes-of-mass-storage. "That machine can't run GNU EMACS, it doesn't have
enough computrons!" This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat
computing power as a fungible commodity good like a crop yield or diesel
horsepower. see {bitty box}, {Get a real computer!}, {toy}, {crank}. 2. A
mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of computation or
information, in much the same way that an electron bears one unit of electric
charge (see {bogon}). An elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has
been worked out based on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid
object move more rapidly as it is heated. It is argued that an object melts
because the molecules have lost their information about where they are
supposed to be (that is, they have emitted computrons). This explains why
computers get so hot and require air conditioning; they use up computrons.
Conversely, you should be able to cool down an object by placing it in the
path of a computron beam. It is believed that this may also explain why
machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room --- because the
computrons there have been all used up by your other hardware. (This may owe
something to a group of 4 fantasy stories by Larry Niven, the best known
being `What Good is a Glass Dagger?', in which magic is fueled by an
exhaustible natural resource called `mana'). condition out: vt. To prevent a
section of code from being compiled by surrounding it with a
conditional-compilation directive whose condition is always false. The
{canonical} example is `#if 0' and `#endif' in C. Compare {comment out}.
condom: n. The protective plastic baggy that accompanies 3.5-inch microfloppy
diskettes. Rarely, used of (paper) disk envelopes. Unlike the write protect,
the condom (when left on) not only impedes the practice of {SEX}, it has been
shown to have a high failure rate as drive mechanisms attempt to access the
disk --- and can even fatally frustrate insertion! connector conspiracy:
[probably came into prominence with the appearance of the KL-10, none of
whose connectors matched anything else] n. The tendency of manufacturers (or,
by extension, programmers or purveyors of anything) to come up with new
products which don't fit together with the old stuff, thereby making you buy
either all new stuff or expensive interface devices. The KL-10 Massbus
connector was actually *patented* by DEC, which is reputed to have refused to
license the design and thus effectively locked third parties out of
competition for the lucrative Massbus peripherals market. This is a source of
never-ending frustration for the die-hards who maintain older PDP-10 or VAX
systems. Their CPUs work fine, but they're stuck with dying, obsolescent disk
and tape drives with low capacity and high power requirements. In these
latter days of open-systems computing this term has fallen somewhat into
disuse, to be replaced by the observation that "Standards are great! There
are so *many* of them." Compare {backward combatability}. cons: /konz/ or
/kons/ [from LISP] 1. v. To add a new element to a list, esp. at the top. 2.
`cons up': vt. To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an example".
considered harmful: adj. Edsger W. Dijkstra's infamous March 1968
Communications of the ACM note, `Goto Statement Considered Harmful', fired
the first salvo in the `structured programming' wars. Amusingly, the ACM
considered the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that they will (by
policy) no longer print an article which takes up that assertive a position
against a coding practice. In the ensuing decades, a large number of both
serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the form `X considered Y'.
The `structured programming' wars eventually blew over with the realization
that both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has remained as a
persistent minor in-joke (the `considered silly' found at various places in
this lexicon is related). console:: n. 1. The operator's station of a
{mainframe}. In times past, this was a privileged location which conveyed
godlike powers to him (almost invariably a `him') with his fingers on the
keys. Under UNIX and other modern timesharing OSes, such privileges are
guarded by passwords, and the console is just the {tty} the system was booted
from. Some of the mystique remains, however, and it is traditional for
sysadmins to post urgent messages to all users from /dev/console. 2. On
microcomputer UNIX boxes: the main screen and keyboard (as opposed to
character-only terminals talking to a serial port). Typically only the
console can do real graphics or run {X}. see also {CTY}. console jockey: n.
see {terminal junkie}. content-free: adj. Ironic analogy with `context-free',
used of a message that adds nothing to the recipient's knowledge. Though this
adjective is sometimes applied to {flamage}, it more usually connotes
derision for communication styles which exalt form over substance, or are
centered on concerns irrelevant to the subject ostensibly at hand. Perhaps
most used with reference to speeches by company presidents and like animals.
"Content-free? Uh...that's anything printed on glossy paper". see also
{four-color glossies}. control-c: vi. "Stop whatever you are doing." From the
interrupt character used on many operating systems to abort a running
program. Considered silly. control-o: vi. "Stop talking." From the character
used on many operating systems to abort output but allow the program to keep
on running. Generally means that you are not interested in hearing anything
more from that person, at least on that topic; a standard respond to someone
who is flaming. Considered silly. control-s: vi. "Stop talking for a second."
From the ASCII XOFF character (this is also pronounced XOFF /eks'off/).
Control-s differs from {control-o} in that the person is asked to stop
talking (perhaps because you are on the phone) but will be allowed to
continue when you're ready to listen to him, as opposed to control-o which
has more of the meaning of "Shut up." Considered silly. Conway's Law: prov.
The rule that the organization of the software and the organization of the
software team will be congruent; originally stated as "If you have four
groups working on a compiler, you'll get a four-pass compiler." This was
originally promulgated by Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who wrote an
assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE. The name `SAVE' didn't stand for
anything; it was just that you lost fewer decks and listings because they all
had SAVE written on top of them. cookie: n. A handle, transaction ID, or
other token of agreement between cooperating programs. "I give him a packet,
he gives me back a cookie." Compare {magic cookie}; see also {fortune
cookie}. cookie bear: n. Syn. {cookie monster}. cookie file: n. A collection
of {fortune cookie}s in a format that facilitates retrieval by a fortune
program. There are several different ones in public distribution, and site
admins often assemble their own from various sources including this lexicon.
cookie monster: [from `Sesame Street'] n. Any of a family of early (1970s)
hacks reported on {TOPS-10}, {ITS}, {Multics}, and elsewhere that would lock
up either the victim's terminal (on a time-sharing machine) or the
{{console}} (on a batch {mainframe}), repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE".
The required responses ranged in complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A
COOKIE" and upward. see also {wabbit}. copper: n. Conventional
electron-carrying network cable, which uses copper as a core conductor --- or
aluminum! Opposed to {light pipe} or, say, a short-range microwave link. copy
protection: n. A class of clever methods for preventing incompetent pirates
from stealing software and legitimate customers from using it. Considered
silly. copybroke: adj. [play on `copyright'] Used to describe an instance of
a copy-protected program which has been `broken'; that is, a copy with the
copy-protection scheme disabled. Syn. {copywronged}. copyleft: /kop'ee-left/
[play on `copyright'] n. 1. The copyright notice (`General Public License')
carried by {GNU} {EMACS} and other Free Software Foundation software,
granting re-use and reproduction rights to all comers (but see also {General
Public Virus}). 2. By extension, any copyright notice intended to achieve
similar aims. copywronged: [play on `copyright'] adj. Syn. for {copybroke}.
core: n. Main storage or RAM. Dates from the days of ferrite-core memory; now
archaic most places outside IBM, but also still used in the UNIX community
and by old-time hackers or those who would sound like same. Some derived
idioms are quite current; `in core', for example, means `in memory' (as
opposed to `on disk'), and both {core dump} and the `core image' or `core
file' produced by one are terms in favors. Commonwealth hackish prefers
{store}. core dump: n. [common {Iron Age} jargon, preserved by UNIX] 1. A
copy of the contents of {core} produced when a process is aborted by certain
kinds of internal error. 2. By extension, used for humans passing out,
vomiting, or registering extreme shock. "He dumped core. All over the floor.
What a mess." "He heard about ... and dumped core." 3. Occasionally used for
a human rambling on pointlessly at great length; esp. in apology: "Sorry I
dumped core on you". 4. A recapitulation of knowledge (compare {bits}, sense
1). Hence, spewing all one knows about a topic, esp. in a lecture or answer
to an exam question. "Short, concise answers are better than core dumps."
(from the instructions to a qual exam at Columbia; compare {brain dump}). see
{core}. core leak: n. Syn. {memory leak}. Core Wars: n. A game between
`assembler' programs in a simulated machine, where the objective is to kill
your opponent's program by overwriting it. This was popularized by A. K.
Dewdney's column in `Scientific American' magazine, but is said to have been
first devised by Victor Vyssotsky as a PDP-1 hack, during the early '60s at
Bell Labs. It is rumored that the game is a civilized version of an amusement
called DARWIN common on multitasking machines before the advent of protected
address segments. see {core}. corge: /korj/ [originally, the name of a cat]
n. Yet another meta-syntactic variable, invented by Mike Gallaher and
propagated by the Gosmacs documentation. see {grault}. cosmic rays: n.
Notionally, the cause of {bit rot}. However, this is a semi-independent usage
which may be invoked as a humorous way to {handwave} away any minor
{randomness} that doesn't seem worth the bother of investigating. "Hey, Eric
--- I just got a burst of garbage on my {tube}, where did that come from?"
"Cosmic rays, I guess." Compare {sunspots}, {phase of the moon}. The British
seem to prefer the usage `cosmic showers'; `alpha particles' is also heard,
because stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip can cause
single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as memory sizes and
densities increase). Factual note: alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays
do not (except occasionally in spaceborne computers). Intel could not explain
random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays. So
they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, 25 tons of lead, and used two
identical boards for testing. One was placed in the safe, one outside. The
hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should
see a statistically significant difference between the error rates on the two
boards. They did not observe such a difference. Further investigation
demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due to alpha particle
emission from thorium (and to a much lesser degree uranium) in the
encapsulation material. Since it is impossible to eliminate these
radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the earth's crust, with
the statistically insignificant exception of uranium mines) it became obvious
that you have to design memories to withstand these hits. cough and die: v.
Syn. {barf}. Connotes that the program is throwing its hands up by design
rather than because of a bug or oversight. cowboy: [Sun, from William
Gibson's {cyberpunk} SF] n. Synonym for {hacker}. It is reported that, at
Sun, this is often said with reverence.
