 :COME FROM: n. A semi-mythical language construct dual to the `go to'; COME
FROM <label> would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly and
{automagically} be transferred to the statement following the COME FROM. COME
FROM was first proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's A Linguistic Contribution to
GOTO-less programming, which appeared in a 1973 {Datamation} issue (and was
reprinted in the April 1984 issue of Communications of the ACM). This
parodied the then-raging `structured programming' {holy wars} (see
{considered harmful}). Mythically, some variants are the assigned COME FROM
and the computed COME FROM (parodying some nasty control constructs in
FORTRAN and some extended BASICs). Of course, multi-tasking (or
non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than one COME FROM
statement coming from the same label. In some ways the FORTRAN DO looks like
a COME FROM statement. After the terminating statement number/CONTINUE is
reached, control continues at the statement following the DO. Some generous
FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than CONTINUE) for the
statement, leading to examples like: DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
