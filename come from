 COME FROM n. A semi-mythical language construct dual to the `go to'; COME
FROM <label> would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly fall through to
the statement following the COME FROM. COME FROM was first proposed in a
Datamation article in 1973 that parodied the then-raging `structured
programming' wars (see CONSIDERED HARMFUL). Mythically, some variants are the
"assigned come from", and the "computed come from" (parodyong some nasty
control constructs in BASIC and FORTRAN). Notionally, multi-tasking can be
implemented by having more than one COME FROM statement coming from the same
label. COME FROM was actually implemented under a different name in Univac's
Fortran, c.1975. The statement "AT 100" would perform a "COME FROM 100". It
was intended strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to
anyone so deranged as to use it in production code. It was supported under
its own name for the first time fifteen years later, in C-INTERCAL (see
INTERCAL, RETROCOMPUTING); knowledgeable observers are still reeling from
shock.
