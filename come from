 COME FROM n. A semi-mythical language construct dual to the `go to'; COME
FROM <label> would cause the referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor,
so that if the program ever reached it control would quietly fall through to
the statement following the COME FROM. COME FROM was first proposed in a
Datamation article in 1973 that parodied the then-raging `structured
programming' wars (see CONSIDERED HARMFUL). It was actually implemented for
the first time seventeen years later, in C-INTERCAL (see INTERCAL,
RETROCOMPUTING); knowledgeable observers are still reeling from shock.
