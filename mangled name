 :mangled name: n. A name, appearing in a C++ object file, that is a coded
representation of the object declaration as it appears in the source. Mangled
names are used because C++ allows multiple objects to have the same name, as
long as they are distinguishable in some other way, such as by having
different parameter types. Thus, the internal name must have that additional
information embedded in it, using the limited character set allowed by most
linkers. For instance, one popular compiler encodes the standard library
function declaration "memchr(const void*,int,unsigned int)" as
"@memchr$qpxviui".
