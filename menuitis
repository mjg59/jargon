 MENUITIS /men`yoo-i'tis/ n. Notional disease suffered by software with an
obsessively simple-minded menu interface and no escape. Hackers find this
intensely irritating and much prefer the flexibility of command-line or
language-style interfaces, especially those customizable via macros or a
special-purpose language in which one can encode useful hacks. see
