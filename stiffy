 :stiffy: n. 3.5-inch {microfloppies}, so called because their jackets are
more rigid than those of the 5.25-inch and the (now totally obsolete) 8-inch
floppy. Elsewhere this might be called a `firmy'. For some odd reason,
several sources have taken the trouble to inform us that this term is
widespread in South Africa. Australians, on the other hand, suggest being
careful with it when Down Under, as it is there universally slang for an
ereaction.
