 :well-connected: adj. Said of a computer installation, asserts that it has
reliable email links with the network and/or that it relays a large fraction
of available {Usenet} newsgroups. `Well-known' can be almost synonymous, but
also implies that the site's name is familiar to many (due perhaps to an
archive service or active Usenet users).
