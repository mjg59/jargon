 :well-connected: adj. Said of a computer installation, this means that it
has reliable email links with the network and/or that it relays a large
fraction of available {USENET} newsgroups. `Well-known' can be almost
synonymous, but also implies that the site's name is familiar to many (due
perhaps to an archive service or active USENET users).
