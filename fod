 :FOD: /fod/ v. [Abbreviation for `Finger of Death', originally a spell-name
from fantasy gaming] To terminate with extreme prejudice and with no regard
for other people. From {MUD}s where the wizard command `FOD <player>' results
in the immediate and total death of <player>, usually as punishment for
obnoxious behavior. This migrated to other circumstances, such as "I'm going
to fod the process that is burning all the cycles." Compare {gun}. In
aviation, FOD means Foreign Object Damage, e.g., what happens when a jet
engine sucks up a rock on the runway or a bird in flight. Finger of Death is
a distressingly apt description of what this does to the engine.
