 FOD: /fod/ v. [Abbreviation for `Finger of Death', originally a spell-name
from fantasy gaming] To terminate with extreme prejudice and with no regard
for other people. From {MUD}s where the wizard command `FOD <player>' results
in the immediate and total death of <player>, usually as punishment for
obnoxious behavior. This migrated to other circumstances, such as "I'm going
to fod the process that is burning all the cycles." Compare {gun}. In
aviation, FOD means Foreign Object Damage, e.g., what happens when a jet
engine sucks up a rock on the runway or a bird in flight. Finger of Death is
a distressingly apt description of what this does to the engine. fold case:
v. see {smash case}. This term tends to be used more by people who don't mind
that their tools smash case. It also connotes that case is ignored but case
distinctions in data processed by the tool in question aren't destroyed.
followup: n. On USENET, a {posting} generated in response to another posting
(as opposed to a {reply}, which goes by email rather than being broadcast).
Followups include the ID of the {parent message} in their headers; smart
news-readers can use this information to present USENET news in
`conversation' sequence rather than order-of-arrival. see {thread}. foo:
/foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust. 2. Used very generally as a sample name for
absolutely anything, esp. programs and files (esp. scratch files). 3. First
on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples. see
also {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux}, {corge}, {grault}, {garply}, {waldo},
{fred}, {plugh}, {xyzzy}, {thud}. {foo} is the {canonical} example of a
`metasyntactic variable' --- a name used in examples and understood to stand
for whatever thing is under discussion, or any random member of a class of
things under discussion. To avoid confusion, hackers never use `foo' or other
words like it as permanent names for anything. In filenames, a common
convention is that any filename beginning `foo' is a scratch file that may be
deleted at any time. The etymology of hackish `foo' is obscure. When used in
connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang
acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition'), later bowdlerized to
{foobar}. (see also {FUBAR}). However, the use of the word `foo' itself has
more complicated antecedents, including a long history in comic strips and
cartoons. The old "Smokey Stover" comic strips by Bill Holman often included
the word `FOO', in particular on license plates of cars; allegedly, `FOO' and
`BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips. In the 1938 cartoon "Daffy
Doc", a very early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS
FOO!"; oddly, this seems to refer to some approving or positive affirmative
use of foo. It is even possible that hacker usage actually springs from `FOO,
Lampoons and Parody', the title of a comic book first issued in September
1958; the byline read `C. Crumb' but this may well have been a sort-of
pseudonym for noted weird-comix artist Robert Crumb. The title FOO was
featured in large letters on the front cover. An old-time member reports that
in the 1959 `Dictionary of the TMRC Language', compiled at {TMRC} there was
an entry that went something like this: FOO: The first syllable of the sacred
chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME HUM." Our first obligation is to keep the foo
counters turning. For more about the legendary foo counters, see {TMRC}.
Almost the entire AI staff was involved with TMRC, so it is not clear which
group introduced the other to the word FOO. Very probably, hackish `foo' had
no single origin and derives through all these channels from Yiddish `feh'
and/or English `fooey'. foobar: n. Another common metasyntactic variable; see
{foo}. Hackers do *not* generally use this to mean {FUBAR} in either the
slang or jargon sense. fool: n. As used by hackers, specifically describes a
person who habitually reasons from obviously or demonstrably incorrect
premises and cannot be persuaded by evidence to do otherwise; it is not
generally used in its other senses, i.e., to describe a person with a native
incapacity to reason correctly, or a clown. Indeed, in hackish experience
many fools are capable of reasoning all too effectively in executing their
errors. see also {cretin}, {loser}, {fool file, the}. fool file, the:
[USENET] n. A notional repository of all the most dramatically and abysmally
stupid utterances ever. There is a subgenre of {sig block}s that consists of
the header "From the fool file:" followed by some quote the poster wishes to
represent as an immortal gem of dimwittery; for this to be really effective,
the quote has to be so obviously wrong as to be laughable. More than one
USENETter has achieved an unwanted notoriety by being quoted in this way.
Foonly: n. 1. The {PDP-10} successor that was to have been built by the Super
Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory along with
a new operating system. The intention was to leapfrog from the old DEC
timesharing system SAIL was running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX
which at that time was the ARPANET standard. ARPA funding for both the Super
Foonly and the new operating system was cut in 1974. Most of the design team
went to DEC and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.
2. The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the principal Super
Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more colorful personalities. Many
people remember the parrot which sat on Poole's shoulder and was a regular
companion. 3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company. The first was the
F-1 (a.k.a. Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to create
the graphics in the movie "TRON". The F-1 was the fastest PDP-10 ever built,
but only one was ever made. The effort drained Foonly of its financial
resources, and they turned towards building smaller, slower, and much less
expensive machines. Unfortunately, these ran not the popular {TOPS-20} but a
TENEX varient called Foonex; this seriously limited their market. Also, the
machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes requiring
individual attention from more than usually competent site personnel, and
thus had significant reliability problems. Poole's legendary temper and
unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help matters. By the time of the
Jupiter project cancellation in 1983 Foonly's proposal to build another F-1
was eclipsed by the {Mars}, and the company never quite recovered. see the
{Mars} entry for the continuation and moral of this story. footprint: n. 1.
The floor or desk area taken up by a piece of hardware. 2. [IBM] The audit
trail (if any) left by a crashed program (often in plural, `footprints'). see
also {toeprint}. for free: adj. Said of a capability of a programming
language or hardware equipment that is available by its design without
needing cleverness to implement: "In APL, we get the matrix operations for
free." "And owing to the way revisions are stored in this system, you get
revision trees for free." Usually it refers to a serendipitous feature of
doing things a certain way (compare {big win}), but it may refer to an
intentional but secondary feature. for the rest of us: [from the Mac slogan
"The computer for the rest of us"] adj. 1. Used to describe a {spiffy}
product whose affordability shames other comparable products, or (more often)
used sarcastically to describe {spiffy} but very overpriced products. 2.
Describes a program with a limited interface, deliberately limited
capabilities, non-orthogonality, inability to compose primitives, or any
other limitation designed to not `confuse' a na"ive user. This places an
upper bound on how far that user can go before the program begins to get in
the way of the task instead of helping accomplish it. Used in reference to
Macintosh software which doesn't provide obvious capabilities because it is
thought that the poor lusers might not be able to handle them. Becomes `the
rest of *them*' when used in third-party reference; thus, "Yes, it is an
attractive program, but it's designed for The Rest Of Them" means a program
that superficially looks neat but has no depth beyond the surface flash. see
also {WIMP environment}, {Macintrash}, {user-friendly}. fora: pl.n. Plural of
{forum}. foreground: [UNIX] vt. To foreground a task is to bring it to the
top of one's {stack} for immediate processing, and hackers often use it in
this sense for non-computer tasks. "If your presentation is due next week, I
guess I'd better foreground writing up the design document." Technically, on
a time-sharing system, a task executing in foreground is one able to accept
input from and return output to the user; oppose {background}. Nowadays this
term is primarily associated with {{UNIX}}, but it appears first to have been
used in this sense on OS/360. Normally, there is only one foreground task per
terminal (or terminal window); having multiple processes simultaneously
reading the keyboard is a good way to {lose}. forked: [UNIX; prob. influenced
by a mainstream expletive] adj. Terminally slow, or dead. Originated when one
system slowed to incredibly bad speeds because of a process recursively
spawning copies of itself (using the UNIX system call `fork(2)') and taking
up all the process table entries. Fortrash: /for'trash/ n. Hackerism for the
FORTRAN language, referring to its primitive design, gross and irregular
syntax, limited control constructs, and slippery, exception-filled semantics.
fortune cookie: [UNIX] n. A random quote, item of trivia, joke, or maxim
printed to the user's tty at login time or (less commonly) at logout time.
Items from this lexicon have often been used as fortune cookies. see {cookie
file}. forum: n. [USENET, GEnie CI$; pl. `fora' or `forums'] Any discussion
group accessible through a dial-in {BBS}, a {mailing list}, or a {newsgroup}
(see {network, the}). A forum functions much like a bulletin board; users
submit {posting}s for all to read and discussion ensues. Contrast real-time
chat via {talk mode} or point-to-point personal {email}. fossil: n. 1. In
software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in historical
context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break
compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string
escapes in {C}, in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to ASCII and
modern byte-addressable architectures. see {dusty deck}. 2. More
restrictively, a feature with past but no present utility. Example: the
force-all-caps (LCASE) bits in the V7 and {BSD} UNIX tty driver, designed for
use with monocase terminals. In a perversion of the usual
backward-compatibility goal, this functionality has actually been expanded
and renamed in some later {USG UNIX} releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits. 3.
The FOSSIL (Fido/Opus/Seadog Standard Interface Level) driver specification
for serial-port access to replace the {brain-dead} routines in the IBM PC
ROMs. Fossils are used by most MS-DOS {BBS} software in lieu of programming
the {bare metal} of the serial ports, as the ROM routines do not support
interrupt-driven operation or setting speeds above 9600. Since the FOSSIL
specification allows additional functionality to be hooked in, drivers that
use the {hook} but do not provide serial-port access themselves are named
with a modifier, as in `video fossil'. four-color glossies: 1. Literature
created by {marketroid}s that allegedly containing technical specs but which
is in fact as superficial as possible without being totally {content-free}.
"Forget the four-color glossies, give me the tech ref manuals." Often applied
as an indication of superficiality even when the material is printed on
ordinary paper in black and white. Four-color-glossy manuals are *never*
useful for finding a problem. 2. [rare] Applied by extension to manual pages
that don't contain enough information to diagnose why the program doesn't
produce the expected or desired output. fragile: adj. Syn {brittle}. fred: n.
1. The personal name most frequently used as a metasyntactic variable (see
{foo}). Allegedly popular because it's easy for a non-touch-typist to type on
a standard QWERTY keyboard. Unlike {J. Random Hacker} or `J. Random Loser',
this name has no positive or negative loading (but see {Mbogo, Dr. Fred}). 2.
An acronym for `Flipping Ridiculous Electronic Device'; other F-verbs may be
substituted for `flipping'. frednet: /fred'net/ n. Used to refer to some
{random} and uncommon protocol encountered on a network. "We're implementing
bridging in our router to solve the frednet problem." freeware: n. Free
software, often written by enthusiasts and distributed by users' groups, or
via electronic mail, local bulletin boards, {USENET}, or other electronic
media. At one time, `freeware' was a trademark of Andrew Fluegelman, the
author of the well-known MS-DOS comm program PC-TALK III. It wasn't enforced
after his mysterious disappearance and presumed death in 1984. see
{shareware}. freeze: v. To lock an evolving software distribution or document
against changes so it can be released with some hope of stability. Carries
the strong implication that the item in question will `unfreeze' at some
future date. "OK, fix that bug and we'll freeze for release." There are more
specific constructions on this. A `feature freeze', for example, locks out
modifications intended to introduce new features; a `code freeze' connotes no
more changes at all. At Sun Microsystems and elsewhere, one may also hear
references to `code slush' --- that is, an almost-but-not-quite frozen state.
fried: adj. 1. Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out. Especially
used of hardware brought down by a `power glitch' (see {glitch}),
{drop-outs}, a short, or some other electrical event. (Sometimes this
literally happens to electronic circuits! In particular, resistors can burn
out and transformers can melt down, emitting noxious smoke. However, this
term is also used metaphorically.) Compare {frotzed}. 2. Of people,
exhausted. Said particularly of those who continue to work in such a state.
Often used as an explanation or excuse. "Yeah, I know that fix destroyed the
file system, but I was fried when I put it in." Esp. common in conjunction
with `brain': "My brain is fried today, I'm very short on sleep." friode:
/fri:'ohd/ [TMRC] n. A reversible (that is, fused or blown) diode. Compare
{fried}. fritterware: n. An excess of capability that serves no productive
end. The canonical example is font-diddling software on the Mac (see
{macdink}); the term describes anything that eats huge amounts of time for
quite marginal gains in function but seduces people into using it anyway.
frob: /frob/ 1. n. [MIT] The {TMRC} definition was "FROB = a protruding arm
or trunnion"; by metaphoric extension, a `frob' is any random small thing; an
object that you can comfortably hold in one hand; something you can frob. see
{frobnitz}. 2. vt. Abbreviated form of {frobnicate}. 3. [from the {MUD}
world] A command on some MUDs that changes a player's experience level (this
can be used to make wizards); also, to request {wizard} privileges on the
`professional courtesy' grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere. frobnicate:
/frob'ni-kayt/ vt. [Poss. derived from {frobnitz}, and usually abbreviated to
{frob}, but `frobnicate' is recognized as the official full form.] To
manipulate or adjust, to tweak. One frequently frobs bits or other 2-state
devices. Thus: "Please frob the light switch" (that is, flip it), but also
"Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it". One also sees the construction
`to frob a frob'. see {tweak} and {twiddle}. Usage: frob, twiddle, and tweak
sometimes connote points along a continuum. `Frob' connotes aimless
manipulation; `twiddle' connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search
for a proper setting; `tweak' connotes fine-tuning. If someone is turning a
knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he is probably
tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen, he is
probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob is
fun, he's frobbing it. The variant `frobnosticate' has been recently
reported. frobnitz: /frob'nits/, pl. `frobnitzem' /frob'nit-zm/ or `frobni'
/frob'ni:/ n. An unspecified physical object, a widget. Also refers to
electronic black boxes. This rare form is usually abbreviated to `frotz', or
more commonly to {frob}. Also used are `frobnule' (/frob'n[y]ool/) and
`frobule' (/frob'yool/). Starting perhaps in 1979, `frobozz' /fruh-boz'/
(plural: `frobbotzim' /fruh-bot'zm/) has also become very popular, largely
through its exposure as a name via {Zork}. These can also be applied to
nonphysical objects, such as data structures. frog: alt. `phrog' 1. interj.
Term of disgust (we seem to have a lot of them). 2. Used as a name for just
about anything. see {foo}. 3. n. Of things, a crock. 4. n. Of people,
somewhere in between a turkey and a toad. 5. `froggy': adj. Similar to
`bagbiting' (see {bagbiter}), but milder. "This froggy program is taking
forever to run!" front end: n. 1. An intermediary computer that does set-up
and filtering for another (usually more powerful but less friendly) machine
(a `back end'). 2. What you're talking to when you have a conversation with
someone who is making replies without paying attention. "Look at the dancing
elephants!" "Uh-huh." "Do you know what I just said?" "Sorry, you were
talking to the front end." see also {fepped out}. 3. Software that provides
an interface to another program `behind' it, which may not be as
user-friendly. Probably from analogy with hardware front-ends (see sense 1)
that interfaced with mainframes. frotz: /frots/ 1. n. see {frobnitz}. 2.
`mumble frotz': An interjection of very mild disgust. frotzed: /frotst/ adj.
{down} because of hardware problems. Compare {fried}. A machine that is
merely frotzed may be fixable without replacing parts, but a fried machine is
more seriously damaged. frowney: n. (alt. `frowney face') see {emoticon}.
fry: 1. vi. To fail. Said especially of smoke-producing hardware failures.
More generally, to become non-working. Usage: never said of software, only of
hardware and humans. see {fried}, {magic smoke}. 2. vt. To cause to fail; to
{roach}, {toast}, or {hose} a piece of hardware. Never used of software or
humans, but compare {fried}.
