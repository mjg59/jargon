 FOD: v. [Abbreviation for `Finger of Death', originally a spell-name from
fantasy gaming] To terminate with extreme prejudice and with no regard for
other people. From {MUD}s where the wizard command `FOD <player>' results in
the immediate and total death of <player>, usually as punishment for
obnoxious behavior. This migrated to other circumstances, such as "I'm going
to fod that process which is burning all the cycles." Compare {gun}. In
aviation, FOD means Foreign Object Damage, e.g. what happens when a jet
engine sucks up a rock on the runway. Finger of Death is an distressingly apt
description of the usual results of this! fold case: v. see {smash case}.
This term tends to be used more by people who don't *mind* that their tools
smash case. It also connotes that case is ignored but case distinctions in
data processed by the tool in question aren't destroyed. followup: n. On
USENET, a {posting} generated in response to another posting (as opposed to a
{reply}, which goes by email rather than being broadcast). Followups include
the ID of the {parent message} in their headers; smart news-readers can use
this information to present USENET news in `conversation' sequence rather
than order-of-arrival. see {thread}. foo: /foo/ 1. interj. Term of disgust.
2. n. Name used for temporary programs, or samples of three-letter names.
Other similar words are {bar}, {baz} (Stanford corruption of {bar}), and
rarely `rag'. 3. Used very generally as a sample name for absolutely
anything. 4. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in
syntax examples. see also: {bar}, {baz}, {qux}, {quux}, {corge}, {grault},
{garply}, {waldo}, {fred}, {plugh}, {xyzzy}, {thud}. {foo} is the {canonical}
example of a `metasyntactic variable'; a name used in examples and understood
to stand for whatever thing is under discussion, or any random member of a
class of things under discussion. To avoid confusion, hackers never use `foo'
or other words like it as permanent names for anything. In filenames, a
common convention is that any filename beginning `foo' is a scratch file
which may be deleted at any time. The etymology of hackish `foo' is obscure.
When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the WWII-era
army slang acronym FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition), later
bowdlerized to {foobar}. (see also {FUBAR}). However, the use of the word
`foo' itself has more complicated antecedents, including a long history in
comic strips and cartoons. The old `Smokey Stover' comic strips by Bill
Holman often included the word `FOO', in particular on license plates of
cars; allegedly, `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's `Pogo' strips.
In a 1938 cartoon Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!" It is
even possible that hacker usage actually springs from the title `FOO,
Lampoons and Parody' of a comic book first issued 20 years later, in
September 1958; the byline read `C. Crumb' but this may well have been a
sort-of pseudonym for noted weird-comix artist Robert Crumb. The title FOO
was featured in large letters on the front cover. An old-time member reports
that in the semi-legendary 1959 "Dictionary of the TMRC Language", compiled
at TMRC (the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, pronounced /tmerk'/), there was
an entry which went something like this: FOO: The first syllable of the
sacred chant phrase "FOO MANE PADME HUM." Our first obligation is to keep the
foo counters turning. By 1962, TMRC's legendary model-railroad layout was
already a marvel of complexity for which the control system alone featured
about 1200 relays. There were {scram switch}es located at numerous places
around the room which could be pressed if something undesirable was about to
occur, such as a train going full-bore at an obstruction. Another feature of
the system was a digital clock on the dispatch board. Normally it ran at some
multiple of real time, but if someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped
and the display was replaced with the word "FOO". Almost the entire AI staff
was involved with the TMRC, so it's not clear that anyone can say which group
introduced the other to the word FOO. Very probably, hackish `foo' had no
single origin and derives through all these channels from Yiddish `feh'
and/or English `fooey!'. foobar: n. Another common metasyntactic variable;
see {foo}. Note that hackers do *not* generally use this to mean {FUBAR} in
either slang or jargon senses! fool: n. As used by hackers, specifically
describes a person who habitually reasons from obviously or demonstrably
incorrect premises and cannot be persuaded by evidence to do otherwise; it is
not generally used in its other senses, i.e., to describe a person with a
native incapacity to reason correctly, or a clown. Indeed, in hackish
experience many fools are capable of reasoning all too effectively in
executing their errors. see also {cretin}, {loser}. footprint: n. 1. The
floor or desk area taken up by a piece of hardware. 2. [IBM] The audit trail
(if any) left by a crashed program (often in plural, `footprints'). see also
{toeprint}. for free: adj. Said of a capability of a programming language or
hardware equipment which is available by its design without needing
cleverness to implement, e.g, "In APL, we get the matrix operations for
free", or "And owing to the way revisions are stored in this system, you get
revision trees for free." Usually it refers to a serendipitous feature of
doing things a certain way (compare {big win}), but may refer to an
intentional but secondary feature. for the rest of us: [from the Mac slogan
"The computer for the rest of us"] adj. 1. Used to describe a {spiffy}
product whose affordability shames other comparable products, or (more often)
used sarcastically to describe {spiffy} but very overpriced products. 2.
Describes a program with a limited interface, deliberately limited
capabilities, non-orthogonality, inability to compose primitives, or any
other limitation designed to not `confuse' a naive user. This places an upper
bound on how far that user can go before the program begins to get in the way
of the task instead of helping accomplish it. Used in reference to Macintosh
software which doesn't provide obviously necessary capabilities (and which
are obvious to implement) because it is thought that the users wouldn't need
them, wouldn't understand them, and other applicable patronizing terms.
Becomes `the rest of *them*' when used in third-party reference; thus, "Yes,
it is an attractive program, but it's designed for The Rest Of Them" means a
program which superficially is neat but has no depth beyond the surface
flash. see {WIMP environment}, {Macintrash}. foreground: [UNIX] adj.,vt. 1.
[techspeak] On a time-sharing system, a task executing in foreground is one
able to accept input from and return output to the user; oppose {background}.
Nowadays this term is primarily associated with {UNIX}, but it appears first
to have been used in this sense on OS/360. Normally, there is only one
foreground task per terminal (or terminal window); having multiple processes
simultaneously reading the keyboard is a good way to {lose}. 2. By extension,
to `foreground a task' is to bring it to the top of one's {stack} for
immediate processing, and hackers often use it in this sense for non-computer
tasks. forked: [UNIX] adj. Terminally slow, or dead. Originated when the
system slowed to incredibly bad speeds due to a process recursively spawning
copies of itself (using the UNIX system call `fork(2)') and taking up all the
process table entries. Fortrash: n. Hackerism for the FORTRAN language,
referring to its primitive design, gross and irregular syntax, limited
control constructs, and slippery, exception-filled semantics. fortune cookie:
[UNIX] n. A random quote, item of trivia, joke, or maxim printed to the
user's tty at login time or (less commonly) at logout time. Items from this
lexicon have often been used as fortune cookies. see {cookie file}. fossil:
n. 1. In software, a misfeature that becomes understandable only in
historical context, as a remnant of times past retained so as not to break
compatibility. Example: the retention of octal as default base for string
escapes in {C}, in spite of the better match of hexadecimal to ASCII and
modern byte-addressable architectures. see {dusty deck}. 2. More
restrictively, a feature with past but no present utility. Example: the
force-all-caps (LCASE) bits in the V7 and {BSD} UNIX tty driver, designed for
use with monocase terminals. In a perversion of the usual
backward-compatibility goal, this functionality has actually been expanded
and renamed in some later {USG UNIX} releases as the IUCLC and OLCUC bits. 3.
The FOSSIL (Fido/Opus/Seadog Standard Interface Level) driver specification
for serial-port access to replace the {brain-dead} routines in the IBM PC
ROMs. Fossils are used by most MSDOS {BBS} software in lieu of programming
the {bare metal} of the serial ports, as the ROM routines do not support
interrupt-driven operation or setting speeds above 9600. Since the FOSSIL
specification allows additional functionality to be hooked in, drivers that
use the {hook} but do not provide serial-port access themselves are named
with a modifier, as in `video fossil'. four-color glossies: 1. Literature
created by {marketroid}s allegedly containing technical specs, but in fact as
superficial as possible without being totally {content-free}. "Forget the
four-color glossies, give me the tech ref manuals." Often applied even when
the material is printed on ordinary paper in B&W as an indication of
superficiality. Four-color-glossy manuals are *never* useful for finding a
problem. 2. [rare] Applied by extension to manual pages that don't contain
enough information to diagnose why the program doesn't produce the expected
or desired output. fred: n. 1. The personal name most frequently used as a
metasyntactic variable (see {foo}). Allegedly popular because it's easy to
type on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Unlike {J. Random Hacker} or `J. Random
Loser', this name has no positive or negative loading (but see {Mbogo, Dr.
Fred}). 2. An acronym for `Flipping Ridiculous Electronic Device'; other
F-verbs may be substituted for "flipping". frednet: /fred'net/ n. Used to
refer to some {random} and uncommon protocol encountered on a network. "We're
implementing bridging in our router to solve the frednet problem." freeware:
n. 1. Free software, often written by enthusiasts and distributed by users'
groups, or via electronic mail, local bulletin boards, {USENET}, or other
electronic media. At one time, `freeware' was a trademark of Andrew
Fluegelman, the author of the well-known MS-DOS comm program PC-TALK III. It
wasn't enforced after his mysterious disappearance in 1984. see {shareware}.
2: Sometimes more specifically used for software which is given away with no
conditions nor requests for contributions attached. freeze: v. To lock an
evolving software distribution or document against changes so it can be
released with some hope of stability. Carries the strong implication that the
item in question will `unfreeze' at some future date. "OK, fix that bug and
we'll freeze for release."
