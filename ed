 :ed: n. "ed is the standard text editor." Line taken from the original
{Unix} manual page on ed, an ancient line-oriented editor that is by now used
only by a few {Real Programmer}s, and even then only for batch operations.
The original line is sometimes uttered near the beginning of an emacs vs. vi
holy war on {Usenet}, with the (vain) hope to quench the discussion before it
really takes off. Often followed by a standard text describing the many
virtues of ed (such as the small memory {footprint} on a Timex Sinclair, and
the consistent (because nearly non-existent) user interface).
