 :hosed: adj. Same as {down}. Used primarily by UNIX hackers. Humorous: also
implies a condition thought to be relatively easy to reverse. Probably
derived from the Canadian slang `hoser' popularized by the Bob and Doug
Mackenzie skits on SCTV, but this usage predated SCTV by years in hackerdom
(it was certainly already live at CMU in the 1970s). see {hose}. It is also
widely used of people in the mainstream sense of `in an extremely unfortunate
situation'. Once upon a time, a Cray that had been experiencing periodic
difficulties crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed. It was
discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of some coolant hoses.
The problem was corrected, and users were then assured that everything was OK
because the system had been rehosed. see also {dehose}.
