 HOSED adj. Same as DOWN. Used primarily by UNIX hackers. Humorous: also
implies a condition thought to be relatively easy to reverse. Probably a
back-formation from the Canadian slang `hoser' popularized by the Bob and
Doug skits on SCTV. see HOSE. There is a story that a Cray which had been
experiencing periodic difficulties once CRASHED, and it was announced to have
been HOSED. It was discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of
some coolant hoses. The problem was connected, and users were then assured
that everything was OK because the system had been rehosed. [This is an
excellent example of hackish wordplay --- ESR].
