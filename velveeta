 :velveeta: n. [Usenet: by analogy with {spam}. The trade name Velveeta is
attached in the U.S. to a particularly nasty processed-cheese spread.] Also
knows as {ECP}; a message that is excessively cross-posted, as opposed to
{spam} which is too frequently posted. This term is widely recognized but not
commonly used; most people refer to both kinds of abuse as spam. Compare
{jello}.
