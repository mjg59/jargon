 :tourist: n. 1. [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally
logs in over a network from a remote location for {comm mode}, email, games,
and other trivial purposes. One step below {luser}. ITS hackers often used to
spell this {turist}, perhaps by some sort of tenuous analogy with {luser}
(this usage may also have expressed the ITS culture's penchant for
six-letterisms, and/or been some sort of tribute to Alan Turing). Compare
{twink}, {lurker}, {read-only user}. 2. [IRC] An {IRC} user who goes from
channel to channel without saying anything; see {channel hopping}.
