 :tourist: /n./ [ITS] A guest on the system, especially one who generally
logs in over a network from a remote location for {comm mode}, email, games,
and other trivial purposes. One step below {luser}. Hackers often spell this
{turist}, perhaps by some sort of tenuous analogy with {luser} (this also
expresses the ITS culture's penchant for six-letterisms). Compare {twink},
{read-only user}.
