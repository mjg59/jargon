 :Great Runes: n. Uppercase-only text or display messages. Some archaic
operating systems still emit these. see also {runes}, {smash case}, {fold
case}. There is a widespread legend (repeated by earlier versions of this
entry, though tagged as folklore) that the uppercase-only support of various
old character codes and I/O equipment was chosen by a religious person in a
position of power at the Teletype Company because supporting both upper and
lower cases was too expensive and supporting lower case only would have made
it impossible to spell `God' correctly. Not true; the upper-case
interpretation of teleprinter codes was well established by 1870, long before
Teletype was even founded.
