 :Great Runes: n. Uppercase-only text or display messages. Some archaic
operating systems still emit these. see also {runes}, {smash case}, {fold
case}. Decades ago, back in the days when it was the sole supplier of
long-distance hardcopy transmittal devices, the Teletype Corporation was
faced with a major design choice. To shorten code lengths and cut complexity
in the printing mechanism, it had been decided that teletypes would use a
monocase font, either ALL UPPER or all lower. The question was, which one to
choose. A study was conducted on readability under various conditions of bad
ribbon, worn print hammers, etc. Lowercase won; it is less dense and has more
distinctive letterforms, and is thus much easier to read both under ideal
conditions and when the letters are mangled or partly obscured. The results
were filtered up through {management}. The chairman of Teletype killed the
proposal because it failed one incredibly important criterion: "It would be
impossible to spell the name of the Deity correctly." In this way (or so, at
least, hacker folklore has it) superstition triumphed over utility. Teletypes
were the major input devices on most early computers, and terminal
manufacturers looking for corners to cut naturally followed suit until well
into the 1970s. Thus, that one bad call stuck us with Great Runes for thirty
years.
