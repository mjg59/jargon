 :elephantine: adj. Used of programs or systems that are both conspicuous
{hog}s (owing perhaps to poor design founded on {brute force and ignorance})
and exceedingly {hairy} in source form. An elephantine program may be
functional and even friendly, but (as in the old joke about being in bed with
an elephant) it's tough to have around all the same (and, like a pachyderm,
difficult to maintain). In extreme cases, hackers have been known to make
trumpeting sounds or perform expressive proboscatory mime at the mention of
the offending program. Usage: semi-humorous. Compare `has the elephant
nature' and the somewhat more pejorative {monstrosity}. see also
{second-system effect} and {baroque}.
