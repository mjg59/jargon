 ELEPHANTINE adj. Used of programs or systems which are both conspicuous HOGs
(due perhaps to poor design founded on BRUTE FORCE AND IGNORANCE) and
exceedingly HAIRY in source form. An elephantine program may be functional
and even friendly, but (like the old joke about being in bed with an
elephant) it's tough to have around all the same, esp. a bitch to maintain.
In extreme cases, hackers have been known to make trumpeting sounds or
perform expressive zoomorphic mime at the mention of the offending program.
Usage: semi-humorous. Compare "has the elephant nature" and the somewhat more
pejorative MONSTROSITY. see also SECOND-SYSTEM SYNDROME.
