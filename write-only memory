 :write-only memory: n. The obvious antonym to `read-only memory'. Out of
frustration with the long and seemingly useless chain of approvals required
of component specifications, during which no actual checking seemed to occur,
an engineer at Signetics once created a specification for a write-only memory
and included it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved. This
inclusion came to the attention of Signetics {management} only when regular
customers started calling and asking for pricing information. Signetics
published a corrected edition of the data book and requested the return of
the `erroneous' ones. Later, around 1974, Signetics bought a double-page
spread in `Electronics' magazine's April issue and used the spec as an April
Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the
25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet
included diagrams of "bit capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins
remaining vs. number of socket insertions", and "AQL vs. selling price". The
25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%.
