 :mode: /n./ A general state, usually used with an adjective describing the
state. Use of the word `mode' rather than `state' implies that the state is
extended over time, and probably also that some activity characteristic of
that state is being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode." In
its jargon sense, `mode' is most often attributed to people, though it is
sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In particular, see {hack
mode}, {day mode}, {night mode}, {demo mode}, {fireworks mode}, and {yoyo
mode}; also {talk mode}. One also often hears the verbs `enable' and
`disable' used in connection with jargon modes. Thus, for example, a sillier
way of saying "I'm going to crash" is "I'm going to enable crash mode now".
One might also hear a request to "disable flame mode, please". In a usage
much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that certain user
interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain functions. For example,
in order to insert characters into a document in the Unix editor `vi', one
must type the "i" key, which invokes the "Insert" command. The effect of this
command is to put vi into "insert mode", in which typing the "i" key has a
quite different effect (to wit, it inserts an "i" into the document). One
must then hit another special key, "ESC", in order to leave "insert mode".
Nowadays, modeful interfaces are generally considered {losing} but survive in
quite a few widely used tools built in less enlightened times.
