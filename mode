 MODE n. A general state, usually used with an adjective describing the
state. Use of the word "mode" rather than "state" implies that the state is
extended over time, and probably also that some activity characteristic of
that state is being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode."
Usage: in its jargon sense, MODE is most often said of people, though it is
sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. "The E editor normally
uses a display terminal, but if you're on a TTY it will switch to non-display
mode." This term is normally used in a technical sense to describe the state
of a program. Extended usage --- for example, to describe people --- is
definitely slang. In particular, see HACK MODE, DAY MODE, NIGHT MODE, and
YOYO MODE; also TALK MODE and GABRIEL MODE.
