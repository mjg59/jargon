 :evil and rude: adj. Both {evil} and {rude}, but this phrase has the
additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice rather than
incompetence. Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows NT is evil because it's
a competent implementation of a bad design; it's rude because it's
gratuitously incompatible with UNIX in places where compatibility would have
been as easy and effective to do; but it's evil and rude because the
incompatiblities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in UNIX but
rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the Microsoft way.
Hackish evil and rude is close to the mainstream sense of `evil'.
