 :domainist: /doh-mayn'ist/ /adj./ 1. [USENET, by pointed analogy with
"sexist", "racist", etc.] Someone who judges people by the domain of their
email addresses; esp. someone who dismisses anyone who posts from a public
internet provider. "What do you expect from an article posted from aol.com?"
2. Said of an {{Internet address}} (as opposed to a {bang path}) because the
part to the right of the `@' specifies a nested series of `domains'; for
example, esr@snark.thyrsus.com specifies the machine called snark in the
subdomain called thyrsus within the top-level domain called com. see also
{big-endian}, sense 2. The meaning of this term has drifted. At one time
sense 2 was primary. In elder days it was also used of a site, mailer, or
routing program which knew how to handle domainist addresses; or of a person
(esp. a site admin) who preferred domain addressing, supported a domainist
mailer, or proselytized for domainist addressing and disdained {bang path}s.
These senses are now (1996) obsolete, as effectively all sites have
converted.
