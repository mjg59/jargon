 :domainist: /doh-mayn'ist/ adj. 1. Said of an {{Internet address}} (as
opposed to a {bang path}) because the part to the right of the `@' specifies
a nested series of `domains'; for example, eric@snark.thyrsus.com specifies
the machine called snark in the subdomain called thyrsus within the top-level
domain called com. see also {big-endian}, sense 2. 2. Said of a site, mailer,
or routing program which knows how to handle domainist addresses. 3. Said of
a person (esp. a site admin) who prefers domain addressing, supports a
domainist mailer, or prosyletizes for domainist addressing and disdains {bang
path}s. This is now (1991) semi-obsolete, as most sites have converted.
