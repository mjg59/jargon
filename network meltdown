 :network meltdown: n. A state of complete network overload; the network
equivalent of {thrash}ing. This may be induced by a {Chernobyl packet}. see
also {broadcast storm}, {kamikaze packet}. Network meltdown is often a result
of network designs that are optimized for a steady state of moderate load and
don't cope well with the very jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real
world. One amusing instance of this is triggered by the popular and very
bloody shoot-'em-up game Doom on the PC. When used in multiplayer mode over a
network, the game uses broadcast packets to inform other machines when
bullets are fired. This causes problems with weapons like the chain gun which
fire rapidly -- it can blast the network into a meltdown state just as easily
as it shreds opposing monsters.
