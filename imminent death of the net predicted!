 :Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!: /prov./ [Usenet] Since {Usenet} first
got off the ground in 1980--81, it has grown exponentially, approximately
doubling in size every year. On the other hand, most people feel the
{signal-to-noise ratio} of Usenet has dropped steadily. These trends led, as
far back as mid-1983, to predictions of the imminent collapse (or death) of
the net. Ten years and numerous doublings later, enough of these gloomy
prognostications have been confounded that the phrase "Imminent Death Of The
Net Predicted!" has become a running joke, hauled out any time someone
grumbles about the {S/N ratio} or the huge and steadily increasing volume, or
the possible loss of a key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when
ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc.
