 :IRC: /I-R-C/ /n./ [Internet Relay Chat] A worldwide "party line" network
that allows one to converse with others in real time. IRC is structured as a
network of Internet servers, each of which accepts connections from client
programs, one per user. The IRC community and the {Usenet} and {MUD}
communities overlap to some extent, including both hackers and regular folks
who have discovered the wonders of computer networks. Some Usenet jargon has
been adopted on IRC, as have some conventions such as {emoticon}s. There is
also a vigorous native jargon, represented in this lexicon by entries marked
`[IRC]'. see also {talk mode}.
