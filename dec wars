 :DEC Wars: n. A 1983 {USENET} posting by Alan Hastings and Steve Tarr
spoofing the "Star Wars" movies in hackish terms. Some years later, ESR
(disappointed by Hastings and Tarr's failure to exploit a great premise more
thoroughly) posted a 3-times-longer complete rewrite called "UNIX WARS"; the
two are often confused.
