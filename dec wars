 :DEC Wars: n. A 1983 {Usenet} posting by Alan Hastings and Steve Tarr
spoofing the Star Wars movies in hackish terms. Some years later, ESR
(disappointed by Hastings and Tarr's failure to exploit a great premise more
thoroughly) posted a 3-times-longer complete rewrite called Unix WARS; the
two are often confused.
