 DEC WARS n. A 1983 USENET posting by Alan Hastings and Steve Tarr, spoofing
the _Star_Wars_ movies in hackish terms. Some years later, ESR (disappointed
by Hastings/Tarr's failure to exploit a great premise more thoroughly) posted
a three-times-longer complete rewrite called `UNIX WARS'; the two are often
confused.
