 :line starve: [MIT] 1. vi. To feed paper through a printer the wrong way by
one line (most printers can't do this). On a display terminal, to move the
cursor up to the previous line of the screen. "To print `X squared', you just
output `X', line starve, `2', line feed." (The line starve causes the `2' to
appear on the line above the `X', and the line feed gets back to the original
line.) 2. n. A character (or character sequence) that causes a terminal to
perform this action. ASCII 0011010, also called SUB or control-Z, was one
common line-starve character in the days before microcomputers and the X3.64
terminal standard. Unlike `line feed', `line starve' is *not* standard
{{ASCII}} terminology. Even among hackers it is considered a bit silly. 3.
[proposed] A sequence such as \c (used in System V echo, as well as
nroff/troff) that suppresses a {newline} or other character(s) that would
normally be emitted.
