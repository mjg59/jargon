 LINE STARVE [MIT] 1. v. To feed the paper through the terminal the wrong way
by one line (most terminals can't do this!). On a display terminal, to move
the cursor up to the previous line of the screen. Example: "To print X
squared, you just output X, line starve, 2, line feed." (The line starve
causes the 2 to appear on the line above the X, and the line feed gets back
to the original line.) 2. n. A "character" (or character sequence) that
causes a terminal to perform this action. Unlike "line feed", "line starve"
is *not* standard ASCII terminology. Even among hackers it is considered a
bit silly. 3. [proposed] A sequence like \c (used in System V echo, as well
as nroff/troff) which suppresses a line feed that would normally implicitly
be emitted.
