 :terminak: /ter´mi·nak`/, n. [Caltech, ca. 1979] Any malfunctioning computer
terminal. A common failure mode of Lear-Siegler ADM 3a terminals caused the
`L' key to produce the `K' code instead; complaints about this tended to look
like "Terminak #3 has a bad keyboard. Pkease fix." Compare {dread high-bit
disease}, {frogging}; see also {sun-stools}, {HP-SUX}, {Slowlaris}.
