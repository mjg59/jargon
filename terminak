 TERMINAK /ter'mi-nak/ [Caltech, ca. 1979] n. Any malfunctioning computer
terminal. A common failure mode of Lear-Siegler ADM3a terminals caused the
"L" key to produce the "K" code instead; complaints about this tended to look
like "Terminak #3 has a bad keyboard. Pkease fix." see SUN-STOOLS, TELERAT,
HP-SUX.
