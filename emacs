 EMACS /ee'maks/ [from Editing MACroS] n. The ne plus ultra of hacker
editors, a program editor with an entire LISP interpreter inside it.
Originally written by Richard Stallman in TECO at the MIT-AI lab, but the
most widely used versions now run under UNIX. It includes facilities to run
compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail; many hackers spend up to
80% of their tube time inside it. Some versions running under window managers
iconify as a kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor
doesn't include. see also VI.
