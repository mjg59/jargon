 :EMACS: /eeÂ´maks/, n. [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker
editors, a programmable text editor with an entire LISP system inside it. It
was originally written by Richard Stallman in {TECO} under {ITS} at the MIT
AI lab; AI Memo 554 described it as "an advanced, self-documenting,
customizable, extensible real-time display editor". It has since been
reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions exist
that run under most major operating systems. Perhaps the most widely used
version, also written by Stallman and now called "{GNU} EMACS" or {GNUMACS},
runs principally under Unix. (Its close relative XEmacs is the second most
popular version.) It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and
send and receive mail or news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their {tube
time} inside it. Other variants include {GOSMACS}, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS,
Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS. (Though we use the original
all-caps spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly `Emacs'.) Some EMACS
versions running under window managers iconify as an overflowing kitchen
sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet) include.
Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too {heavyweight} and {baroque} for their
taste, and expand the name as `Escape Meta Alt Control Shift' to spoof its
heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with {bucky bits}. Other spoof
expansions include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping' (from when that
was a lot of {core}), `Eventually malloc()s All Computer Storage', and `EMACS
Makes A Computer Slow' (see {recursive acronym}). see also {vi}.
