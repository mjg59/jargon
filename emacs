 ELIZA effect: /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ [AI community] n. The tendency of humans to
attach associations to terms from prior experience. For example, there is
nothing magic about the symbol `+' that makes it well-suited to indicate
addition; it's just that people associate it with addition. Using `+' or
`plus' to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the
ELIZA effect. This term comes from the famous ELIZA program, which simulated
a Rogerian psychoanalyst by rephrasing many of the patient's statements as
questions and posing them to the patient. It worked by simple pattern
recognition and substitution of key words into canned phrases. It was so
convincing, however, that there are many anecdotes about people becoming very
emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA. All this was due to people's
tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer never put there. The
ELIZA effect is a {Good Thing} when writing a programming language, but it
can blind you to serious shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial
Intelligence system. Compare {ad-hockery}; see also {AI-complete}. elvish: n.
1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms resembling the beautiful
Celtic half-uncial hand of the `Book of Kells'. Invented and described by J.
R. R. Tolkien in `The Lord of The Rings' as an orthography for his fictional
`elvish' languages, this system (which is both visually and phonetically
elegant) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to be interested by artificial
languages in general). It is traditional for graphics printers, plotters,
window systems, and the like to support a Feanorian typeface as one of their
demo items. see also {elder days}. 2. By extension, any odd or unreadable
typeface produced by a graphics device. 3. The typeface mundanely called
`B"ocklin', an art-decoish display font. EMACS: /ee'maks/ [from Editing
MACroS] n. The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a program editor with an
entire LISP system inside it. It was originally written by Richard Stallman
in {TECO} under {{ITS}} at the MIT AI lab, but the most widely used versions
now run under UNIX. It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses
and send and receive mail; many hackers spend up to 80% of their {tube time}
inside it. Some versions running under window managers iconify as an
overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does
not (yet) include. Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too heavyweight and
{baroque} for their taste, and expand the name as `Escape Meta Alt Control
Shift' to spoof its heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with {bucky bits}.
Other spoof expansions include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping',
`Eventually `malloc()'s All Computer Storage', and `EMACS Makes A Computer
Slow' (see {{recursive acronym}}). see also {vi}. email: /ee'mayl/ 1. n.
Electronic mail automatically passed through computer networks and/or via
modems over common-carrier lines. Contrast {snail-mail}, {paper-net},
{voice-net}. see {network address}. 2. vt. To send electronic mail. Oddly
enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED; it means "embossed
(with a raised pattern) or arranged in a net work". A use from 1480 is given.
The word is derived from French `emmailleure', network. emoticon:
/ee-moh'ti-kon/ n. An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional state in
email or news. Hundreds have been proposed, but only a few are in common use.
These include: :-) `smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness,
occasionally sarcasm) :-( `frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset) ;-)
`half-smiley' ({ha ha only serious}); also known as `semi-smiley' or `winkey
face'. :-/ `wry face' (These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your
head sideways, to the left.) The first 2 listed are by far the most
frequently encountered. Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe,
GEnie, and BIX; see also {bixie}. On {USENET}, `smiley' is often used as a
generic term synonymous with {emoticon}, as well as specifically for the
happy-face emoticon. It appears that the emoticon was invented by one Scott
Fahlman on the CMU {bboard} systems around 1980. He later wrote: "I wish I
had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date for posterity, but
I had no idea that I was starting something that would soon pollute all the
world's communication channels." [GLS confirms that he remembers this
original posting]. Note for the {newbie}: Overuse of the smiley is a mark of
loserhood! More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign that you've gone
over the line. empire: n. Any of a family of military simulations derived
from a game written by Peter Langston many years ago. There are five or six
multi-player variants of varying degrees of sophistication, and one
single-player version implemented for both UNIX and VMS; the latter is even
available as MS-DOS freeware. All are notoriously addictive. engine: n. 1. A
piece of hardware that encapsulates some function but can't be used without
some kind of {front end}. Today we have, especially, `print engine': the guts
of a laser printer. 2. An analogous piece of software; notionally, one that
does a lot of noisy crunching, such as a `database engine'. The hackish
senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or instrument (the
word is cognate to `ingenuity'). This sense had not been completely eclipsed
by the modern connotation of power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's
time, which explains why he named the stored-program computer that he
designed in 1844 the `Analytical Engine'. English: 1. n.,obs. The source code
for a program, which may be in any language, as opposed to the linkable or
executable binary produced from it by a compiler. The idea behind the term is
that to a real hacker, a program written in his favorite programming language
is at least as readable as English. Usage: used mostly by old-time hackers,
though recognizable in context. 2. The official name of the database language
used by the Pick Operating System, actually a sort of crufty interpreted
BASIC with delusions of grandeur. The name permits {marketroid}s to say "Yes,
and you can program our computers in English!" to ignorant {suit}s without
quite running afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws. enhancement: n.
{Marketroid}-speak for a bug {fix}. This abuse of language is a popular and
time-tested way to turn incompetence into increased revenue. A hacker being
ironic would instead call the fix a {feature} --- or perhaps save some effort
by declaring the bug itself to be a feature.
