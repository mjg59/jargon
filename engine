 :engine: n. 1. A piece of hardware that encapsulates some function but can't
be used without some kind of {front end}. Today we have, especially, `print
engine': the guts of a laser printer. 2. An analogous piece of software;
notionally, one that does a lot of noisy crunching, such as a `database
engine'. The hacker senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or instrument (the
word is cognate to `ingenuity'). This sense had not been completely eclipsed
by the modern connotation of power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's
time, which explains why he named the stored-program computer that he
designed in 1844 the `Analytical Engine'.
