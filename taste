 :taste: [primarily MIT] n. 1. The quality in a program that tends to be
inversely proportional to the number of features, hacks, and kluges
programmed into it. Also `tasty', `tasteful', `tastefulness'. "This feature
comes in N tasty flavors." Although `tasteful' and `flavorful' are
essentially synonyms, `taste' and {flavor} are not. Taste refers to sound
judgment on the part of the creator; a program or feature can *exhibit* taste
but cannot *have* taste. On the other hand, a feature can have {flavor}.
Also, {flavor} has the additional meaning of `kind' or `variety' not shared
by `taste'. {Flavor} is a more popular word than `taste', though both are
used. see also {elegant}. 2. Alt. sp. of {tayste}.
