 TASTE n. [primarily MIT-DMS] The quality in programs which tends to be
inversely proportional to the number of features, hacks, and kluges
programmed into it. Also, TASTY, TASTEFUL, TASTEFULNESS. "This feature comes
in N tasty flavors." Although TASTEFUL and FLAVORFUL are essentially
synonyms, TASTE and FLAVOR are not. TASTE refers to sound judgement on the
part of the creator; a program or feature can *exhibit* taste but cannot
"have" taste. On the other hand, a feature can have FLAVOR. Also, FLAVOR has
the additional meaning of "kind" or "variety" not shared by TASTE. FLAVOR is
a more popular word among hackers than TASTE, though both are used.
