 :Archimedes: The world's first RISC microcomputer, available only in the
British Commonwealth and europe. Built in 1987 in Great Britain by Acorn
Computers, it was legendary for its use of the ARM-2 microprocessor as a CPU.
Many a novice hacker in the Commonwealth first learnt his or her skills on
the Archimedes, since it was specifically designed for use in schools and
educational institutions. Owners of Archimedes machines are often still
treated with awe and reverence. Familiarly, "archi".
