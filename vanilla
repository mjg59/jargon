 :vanilla: [from the default flavor of ice cream in the U.S.] adj. Ordinary
{flavor}, standard. When used of food, very often does not mean that the food
is flavored with vanilla extract! For example, `vanilla wonton soup' means
ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to hot-and-sour wonton soup. Applied to
hardware and software, as in "Vanilla Version 7 UNIX can't run on a vanilla
11/34." Also used to orthogonalize chip nomenclature; for instance, a 74V00
means what TI calls a 7400, as distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word differs
from {canonical} in that the latter means `default', whereas vanilla simply
means `ordinary'. For example, when hackers go on a {great-wall},
hot-and-sour wonton soup is the {canonical} wonton soup to get (because that
is what most of them usually order) even though it isn't the vanilla wonton
soup.
