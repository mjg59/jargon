 VANILLA adj. Ordinary flavor, standard. see FLAVOR. When used of food, very
often does not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract! For
example, "vanilla-flavored wonton soup" (or simply "vanilla wonton soup")
means ordinary wonton soup, as opposed to hot and sour wonton soup. Applied
to hardware and software. As in "Vanilla Version 7 UNIX can't run on a
vanilla 11/34". Also used to orthogonalize TTL nomenclature; for instance a
74V00 is what TI calls a 7400, as distinct from a 74LS00, etc. This word
differs from [CANONICAL in that the latter means "the thing you always use
(or the way you always do it) unless you have some strong reason to do
otherwise", whereas VANILLA simply means "ordinary". For example, when
hackers go on a GREAT WALL (q.v.), hot-and-sour wonton soup is the CANONICAL
wonton soup to get (because that is what most of them usually order) even
though it isn't the VANILLA wonton soup.
