 :special-case: vt. To write unique code to handle input to or situations
arising in a program that are somehow distinguished from normal processing.
This would be used for processing of mode switches or interrupt characters in
an interactive interface (as opposed, say, to text entry or normal commands),
or for processing of {hidden flag}s in the input of a batch program or
{filter}.
