 :BogoMIPS: /bo´go·mips/, n. The number of million times a second a processor
can do absolutely nothing. The {Linux} OS measures BogoMIPS at startup in
order to calibrate some soft timing loops that will be used later on; details
at the BogoMIPS mini-HOWTO. The name Linus chose, of course, is an ironic
comment on the uselessness of all other {MIPS} figures.
