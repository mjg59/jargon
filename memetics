 MEMETICS /me-me-tiks/ [from MEME] The study of memes. As of 1990, this is
still an extremely informal and speculative endeavor, though the first steps
towards at least statistical rigor have been made by H. Keith Henson and
others. Memetics is a popular topic among hackers, who like to see themselves
as the architects of the new information ecologies in which memes live and
replicate.
