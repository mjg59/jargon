 :memetics: /me-met'iks/ n. [from {meme}] The study of memes. As of early
1999, this is still an extremely informal and speculative endeavor, though
the first steps towards at least statistical rigor have been made by H. Keith
Henson and others. Memetics is a popular topic for speculation among hackers,
who like to see themselves as the architects of the new information ecologies
in which memes live and replicate.
