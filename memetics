 :memetics: /me-met'iks/ [from {meme}] The study of memes. As of mid-1991,
this is still an extremely informal and speculative endeavor, though the
first steps towards at least statistical rigor have been made by H. Keith
Henson and others. Memetics is a popular topic for speculation among hackers,
who like to see themselves as the architects of the new information ecologies
in which memes live and replicate.
