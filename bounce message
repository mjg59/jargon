 :bounce message: n. [UNIX] Notification message returned to sender by a site
unable to relay {email} to the intended {{Internet address}} recipient or the
next link in a {bang path} (see {bounce}, sense 1). Reasons might include a
nonexistent or misspelled username or a {down} relay site. Bounce messages
can themselves fail, with occasionally ugly results; see {sorcerer's
apprentice mode} and {software laser}. The terms `bounce mail' and `barfmail'
are also common.
