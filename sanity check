 :sanity check: n. [very common] 1. The act of checking a piece of code (or
anything else, e.g., a Usenet posting) for completely stupid mistakes.
Implies that the check is to make sure the author was sane when it was
written; e.g., if a piece of scientific software relied on a particular
formula and was giving unexpected results, one might first look at the
nesting of parentheses or the coding of the formula, as a sanity check,
before looking at the more complex I/O or data structure manipulation
routines, much less the algorithm itself. Compare {reality check}. 2. A
run-time test, either validating input or ensuring that the program hasn't
screwed up internally (producing an inconsistent value or state). 3.
Conversationally, saying "sanity check" means you are requesting a check of
your assumptions. "Wait a minute, sanity check, are we talking about the same
Kevin here?"
