"The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System" by Marshall
Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels and John S. Quarterman
(Addison-Wesley Longman, 1996, ISBN 0-201-54979-4) Either of the standard
reference books on the internals of {BSD} Unix. So called because the covers
have a picture depicting a little devil (a visual play on {daemon}) in
sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring to one of the characteristic
features of Unix, the `fork(2)' system call). Also known as the {Devil Book}.
