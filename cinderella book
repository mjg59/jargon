 :Cinderella Book: [CMU] n. "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and
Computation", by John Hopcroft and Jeffrey Ullman, (Addison-Wesley, 1979). So
called because the cover depicts a girl (putatively Cinderella) sitting in
front of a Rube Goldberg device and holding a rope coming out of it. On the
back cover, the device is in shambles after she has (inevitably) pulled on
the rope. see also {{book titles}}.
