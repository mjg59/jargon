 :COBOL fingers: /koh'bol fing'grz/ n. Reported from Sweden, a (hypothetical)
disease one might get from coding in COBOL. The language requires code
verbose beyond all reason (see {candygrammar}); thus it is alleged that
programming too much in COBOL causes one's fingers to wear down to stubs by
the endless typing. "I refuse to type in all that source code again; it would
give me COBOL fingers!"
