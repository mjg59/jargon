 COBOL FINGERS (koh'bol fing'grs) n. Reported from Sweden, a (hypothetical)
disease one might get from programming in COBOL. The language requires
extremely voluminous code. Programming too much in COBOL causes the fingers
to wear down (by endless typing), until short stubs remain. This malformity
is called COBOL FINGERS. "I refuse to type in all that source code again, it
will give me cobol fingers!"
