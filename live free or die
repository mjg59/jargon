 LIVE FREE OR DIE! imp. 1. The state motto of New Hampshire. 2. A slogan
associated with UNIX in the romantic days when UNIX aficionados saw
themselves as a tiny, beleaguered underground tilting against the windmills
of industry. Armando Stettner, one of the early UNIX developers, used to give
out fake license plates bearing this motto under a large UNIX, all in New
Hampshire colors of green and white. These are now valued collector's items.
