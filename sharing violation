 :sharing violation:[From a file error common to several {OS}es] A response
to receiving information, typically of an excessively personal nature, that
you were probably happier not knowing. "You know those little noises that Pat
makes in bed?" "Whoa! Sharing violation!" In contrast to the original file
error, which indicated that you were _not_ being given data that you _did_
want.
