 :brittle: adj. Said of software that is functional but easily broken by
changes in operating environment or configuration, or by any minor tweak to
the software itself. Also, any system that responds inappropriately and
disastrously to expected external stimuli; e.g., a file system that is
usually totally scrambled by a power failure is said to be brittle. This term
is often used to describe the results of a research effort that were never
intended to be robust, but it can be applied to commercially developed
software, which displays the quality far more often than it ought to. Oppose
{robust}.
