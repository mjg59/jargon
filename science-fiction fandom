 SCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM n. Another voluntary subculture having a very heavy
overlap with hackerdom; most hackers read SF and/or fantasy fiction avidly,
and many go to "cons" (SF conventions) or are involved in fandom-connected
activities like the Society for Creative Anachronism. Some hacker slang
originated in SF fandom; see DEFENESTRATION, GREAT-WALL, CYBERPUNK, H INFIX,
HA HA ONLY SERIOUS, IMHO, MUNDANE, NEEP-NEEP, REAL SOON NOW. Additionally,
the jargon terms CYBERSPACE, DE-REZZ, GO FLATLINE, ICE, VIRUS, WIREHEAD and
WORM originated in SF itself.
