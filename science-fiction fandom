 SCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM (si'@ns fik'shn fan'dm) n. Another voluntary
subculture having a very heavy overlap with hackerdom; almost all hackers
read SF and/or fantasy fiction avidly, and many go to "cons" (SF conventions)
or are involved in fandom-connected activities like the Society for Creative
Anachronism. Some hacker slang originated in SF fandom; see DEFENESTRATION,
GREAT-WALL, CYBERPUNK, H INFIX, HA HA ONLY SERIOUS, IMHO, MUNDANE, NEEP-NEEP,
REAL SOON NOW, SNOG. Additionally, the jargon terms CYBERSPACE, GO FLATLINE,
ICE, VIRUS, and WORM originated in SF itself.
