 :science-fiction fandom:: n. Another voluntary subculture having a very
heavy overlap with hackerdom; most hackers read SF and/or fantasy fiction
avidly, and many go to `cons' (SF conventions) or are involved in
fandom-connected activities such as the Society for Creative Anachronism.
Some hacker jargon originated in SF fandom; see {defenestration},
{great-wall}, {cyberpunk}, {h}, {ha ha only serious}, {IMHO}, {mundane},
{neep-neep}, {Real Soon Now}. Additionally, the jargon terms {cowboy},
{cyberspace}, {de-rezz}, {go flatline}, {ice}, {phage}, {virus}, {wetware},
{wirehead}, and {worm} originated in SF stories.
