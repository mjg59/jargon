 :for values of: [MIT] A common rhetorical maneuver at MIT is to use any of
the canonical {random numbers} as placeholders for variables. "The max
function takes 42 arguments, for arbitrary values of 42.:" "There are 69 ways
to leave your lover, for 69 = 50." This is especially likely when the speaker
has uttered a random number and realizes that it was not recognized as such,
but even `non-random' numbers are occasionally used in this fashion. A
related joke is that p equals 3 -- for small values of p and large values of
3. Historical note: at MIT this usage has traditionally been traced to the
programming language MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), an Algol-58-like
language that was the most common choice among mainstream (non-hacker) users
at MIT in the mid-60s. It inherited from Algol-58 a control structure FOR
VALUES OF X = 3, 7, 99 DO ... that would repeat the indicated instructions
for each value in the list (unlike the usual FOR that only works for
arithmetic sequences of values). MAD is long extinct, but similar
for-constructs still flourish (e.g., in Unix's shell languages).
