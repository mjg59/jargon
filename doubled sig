 :doubled sig: [Usenet] /n./ A {sig block} that has been included twice in a
{Usenet} article or, less commonly, in an electronic mail message. An article
or message with a doubled sig can be caused by improperly configured
software. More often, however, it reveals the author's lack of experience in
electronic communication. see {B1FF}, {pseudo}.
