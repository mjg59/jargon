 DOUBLED SIG /duh'b@ld sig/ [USENET] n. A SIG BLOCK (q.v.) that has been
included twice in a USENET article or, less frequently, in an electronic mail
message. An article or message with a doubled sig can be caused by improperly
configured software. More often, however, it reveals the author's lack of
experience in electronic communication. see BIFF, PSEUDO.
