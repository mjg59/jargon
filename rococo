 :rococo: adj. Terminally {baroque}. Used to imply that a program has become
so encrusted with the software equivalent of gold leaf and curlicues that
they have completely swamped the underlying design. Called after the later
and more extreme forms of Baroque architecture and decoration prevalent
during the mid-1700s in Europe. Alan Perlis said: "Every program eventually
becomes rococo, and then rubble." Compare {critical mass}.
