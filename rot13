 ROT13 /rot-ther'teen/ [USENET, from "rotate alphabet 13 places"] n.,v. The
simple encryption of replacing each English letter with the one 13 places
forward or back along the alphabet, so that "The butler did it!" becomes "Gur
ohgyre qvq vg!" Most Usenet news reading and posting programs include a rot13
feature. It is used as if to enclose the text in a sealed wrapper that the
reader must choose to open, for posting things that might offend some
readers, answers to puzzles, or discussion of movie plot surprises.
