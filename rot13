 :rot13: /rot ther'teen/ n.,v. [Usenet: from `rotate alphabet 13 places'] The
simple Caesar-cypher encryption that replaces each English letter with the
one 13 places forward or back along the alphabet, so that "The butler did
it!" becomes "Gur ohgyre qvq vg!" Most Usenet news reading and posting
programs include a rot13 feature. It is used to enclose the text in a sealed
wrapper that the reader must choose to open -- e.g., for posting things that
might offend some readers, or {spoiler}s. A major advantage of rot13 over
rot(N) for other N is that it is self-inverse, so the same code can be used
for encoding and decoding. see also {spoiler space}, which has partly
displaced rot13 since non-Unix-based newsreaders became common.
