 :compo: n. [{demoscene}] Finnish-originated slang for `competition'. Demo
compos are held at a {demoparty}. The usual protocol is that several groups
make demos for a compo, they are shown on a big screen, and then the party
participants vote for the best one. Prizes (from sponsors and party entrance
fees) are given. Standard compo formats include {intro} compos (4k or 64k
demos), music compos, graphics compos, quick {demo} compos (build a demo
within 4 hours for example), etc.
