 :zombie: n. 1. [Unix] A process that has died but has not yet relinquished
its process table slot (because the parent process hasn't executed a
`wait(2)' for it yet). These can be seen in `ps(1)' listings occasionally.
Compare {orphan}. 2. A machine, especially someone's {home box}, that has
been cracked and is being used as part of a second-stage attack by miscreants
trying to mask their home IP address. Especially used of machines being
exploited in large gangs for a mechanized denial-of-service attack like Tribe
Flood Network; the image that goes with this is of a veritable army of
zombies mindlessly doing the bidding of a necromancer.
