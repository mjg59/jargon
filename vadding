 VADDING (vad'ing) [permutation of ADV, an abbreviated form of ADVENT (q.v.)]
n. A leisure-time activity of certain hackers involving the covert
exploration of the "secret" parts of large buildings -- basements, roofs,
freight elevators, maintenance crawlways, steam tunnels and the like. A few
go so far as to learn locksmithing in order to synthesize vadding keys. The
verb is `to vad'. The most extreme and dangerous form of vadding is ELEVATOR
RODEO, aka ELEVATOR SURFING, a sport played by using the escape hatches in
elevator cars to move between pairs of them as they conjunct within the
shafts. Kids, don't try this at home!
