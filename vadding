 :vadding: /vad'ing/ [from VAD, a permutation of ADV (i.e., {ADVENT}), used
to avoid a particular {admin}'s continual search-and-destroy sweeps for the
game] n. A leisure-time activity of certain hackers involving the covert
exploration of the `secret' parts of large buildings --- basements, roofs,
freight elevators, maintenance crawlways, steam tunnels, and the like. A few
go so far as to learn locksmithing in order to synthesize vadding keys. The
verb is `to vad' (compare {phreaking}; see also {hack}, sense 9). This term
dates from the late 1970s, before which such activity was simply called
`hacking'; the older usage is still prevalent at MIT. The most extreme and
dangerous form of vadding is `elevator rodeo', a.k.a. `elevator surfing', a
sport played by wrasslin' down a thousand-pound elevator car with a 3-foot
piece of string, and then exploiting this mastery in various stimulating ways
(such as elevator hopping, shaft exploration, rat-racing, and the
ever-popular drop experiments). Kids, don't try this at home! see also
{hobbit} (sense 2).
