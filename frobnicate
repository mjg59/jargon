 :frobnicate: /frob'ni-kayt/ /vt./ [Poss. derived from {frobnitz}, and
usually abbreviated to {frob}, but `frobnicate' is recognized as the official
full form.] To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. One frequently frobs bits or
other 2-state devices. Thus: "Please frob the light switch" (that is, flip
it), but also "Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it". One also sees the
construction `to frob a frob'. see {tweak} and {twiddle}. Usage: frob,
twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a continuum. `Frob'
connotes aimless manipulation; `twiddle' connotes gross manipulation, often a
coarse search for a proper setting; `tweak' connotes fine-tuning. If someone
is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he
is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen,
he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob
is fun, he's frobbing it. The variant `frobnosticate' has been recently
reported.
