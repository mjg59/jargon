 FROBNICATE /frob'ni-kayt/ v. To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. Thus:
"Please frob the light switch." (That is, flip the light switch.), but also
"Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it." Poss. derived from FROBNITZ
(q.v.). Usually abbreviated to FROB, but FROBNICATE is recognized as the
official full form. Thus one has the saying "to frob a frob". see TWEAK and
TWIDDLE. Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes connote points along a
continuum. FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross
manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes
fine-tuning. If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's
carefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it
but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing
it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.
