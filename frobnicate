 FROBNICATE v. To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. Derived from FROBNITZ
(q.v.). Usually abbreviated to FROB. Thus one has the saying "to frob a
frob." see TWEAK and TWIDDLE. Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK sometimes con-
note points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE
connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting;
TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is turning a knob on an oscil-
loscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it he is prob- ably tweaking it; if
he is just turning it but looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it;
but if he's just doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frob- bing it.
