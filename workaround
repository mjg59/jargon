 :workaround: n. 1. A temporary {kluge} inserted in a system under
development or test in order to avoid the effects of a {bug} or {misfeature}
so that work can continue. Theoretically, workarounds are always replaced by
{fix}es; in practice, customers often find themselves living with workarounds
in the first couple of releases. "The code died on NUL characters in the
input, so I fixed it to interpret them as spaces." "That's not a fix, that's
a workaround!" 2. A procedure to be employed by the user in order to do what
some currently non-working feature should do. Hypothetical example: "Using
META-F7 {crash}es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but as a workaround you can type
CTRL-R, then SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining {cruft} by hand."
