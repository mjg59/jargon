 :workaround: n. 1. A temporary {kluge} used to bypass, mask, or otherwise
avoid a {bug} or {misfeature} in some system. Theoretically, workarounds are
always replaced by {fix}es; in practice, customers often find themselves
living with workarounds for long periods of time. "The code died on NUL
characters in the input, so I fixed it to interpret them as spaces." "That's
not a fix, that's a workaround!" 2. A procedure to be employed by the user in
order to do what some currently non-working feature should do. Hypothetical
example: "Using META-F7 {crash}es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but as a
workaround you can type CTRL-R, then SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining
{cruft} by hand."
