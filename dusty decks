 DUSTY DECKS [a holdover from card-punch days] n. Old software (especially
applications) with which one is obliged to remain compatible. Used esp. when
referring to old scientific and number-crunching software, much of which was
written in FORTRAN and very poorly documented but would be too expensive to
replace. see FOSSIL.
