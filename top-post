 :top-post: n. v. [common] To put the original portion of an email or Usenet
response before the quoted part, as opposed to the more logical sequence of
quoted portion first with original following. This term is generally used
pejoratively with the implication that the offending person is a {newbie}, a
Microsoft addict (Microsoft mail tools produce a similar format by default),
or a garden-variety idiot. One major problem with top-posting is that people
who do it all too frequently quote the _entire_ parent message rather than
trimming it down to those portions relevent to their reply - this makes
threads bulky and unnecessarily difficult to read and arouses the righteous
ire of experienced Internet residents (this style is called "TOFU" for "text
over, fullquote under, or sometimes "jeopardy-style quotting"). Another
problem is that top-posters often word their replies on the assumption that
you just read the previous message, even though their perversity has put it
further down the page than you have yet read. Oppose {bottom-post}.
