 :top-post: n., v. [common] To put the newly-added portion of an email or
Usenet response before the quoted part, as opposed to the more logical
sequence of quoted portion first with original following. The problem with
this practice is neatly summed up by the following FAQ entry: A: No. Q:
Should I include quotations after my reply? This term is generally used
pejoratively with the implication that the offending person is a {newbie}, a
Microsoft addict (Microsoft mail tools produce a similar format by default),
or simply a common-and-garden-variety idiot. One major problem with
top-posting is that people who do it all too frequently quote the entire
parent message rather than trimming it down to those portions relevent to
their reply -- this makes threads bulky and unnecessarily difficult to read
and arouses the righteous ire of experienced Internet residents (this style
is called "TOFU" for "text over, fullquote under", or sometimes
"jeopardy-style quoting"). Another problem is that top-posters often word
their replies on the assumption that you just read the previous message, even
though their perversity has put it further down the page than you have yet
read. Oppose {bottom-post}.
