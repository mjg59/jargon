 LINE EATER, THE (lien ee'tr, dh@) [USENET] n. A bug in some now-obsolete
versions of the netnews software used to cause the first lines of articles to
be discarded under some circumstances. This bug was personified into mythical
creature called "the line eater", and postings often included a dummy line of
"line eater food". The practice of "sacrificing to the line eater" continued
for some time after the bug had been nailed to the wall, and is still
humorously referred to.
