 LINE EATER, THE [USENET] n. 1. A bug in some now-obsolete versions of the
netnews software used to cause the first parts of articles to be discarded
under some circumstances. This bug was quickly personified as a mythical
creature called "the line eater", and postings often included a dummy line of
"line eater food". The practice of "sacrificing to the line eater" continued
for some time after the bug had been NAILED TO THE WALL, and is still
humorously referred to. The bug itself is still (in mid-1990) occasionally
reported to be lurking in some mail-to-netnews gateways. 2. The mythical NSA
trawling program sometimes assumed to be reading USENET for the U.S.
Government's spooks. Some netters put loaded phrases like `Uzi' `nuclear
materials' `Palestine' `cocaine' and `assassination' in their SIG BLOCKs in
an attempt to confuse and overload the creature.
