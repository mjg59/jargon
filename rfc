 RFC: /ahr ef see/ [Request For Comment] n. One of a long-established series
of numbered Internet standards widely followed by commercial and PD software
in the Internet and UNIX communities. Perhaps the single most influential one
has been RFC-822 (the Internet mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in
that they are floated by technical experts acting on their own initiative and
reviewed by the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through
an institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even
once adopted.
