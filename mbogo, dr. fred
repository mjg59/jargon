you don't want to see about a problem, esp. an incompetent professional; a
shyster. "Do you know a good eye doctor?" "Sure, try Mbogo Eye Care and
Professional Dry Cleaning." The name comes from synergy between {bogus} and
the original Dr. Mbogo, a witch doctor who was Gomez Addams' physician on the
old "Addams Family" TV show. Compare {Bloggs Family, the}, see also {fred}.
