 :demogroup: n. [{demoscene}] A group of {demo} (sense 4) composers. Job
titles within a group include coders (the ones who write programs),
graphicians (the ones who painstakingly pixelate the fine art), musicians
(the music composers), {sysop}s, traders/swappers (the ones who do the
trading and other PR), and organizers (in larger groups). It is not uncommon
for one person to do multiple jobs, but it has been observed that good coders
are rarely good composers and vice versa. [How odd. Musical talent seems
common among Internet/Unix hackers --ESR]
