 :FAQ list: /F-A-Q list/ or /fak list/ [USENET] n. A compendium of
accumulated lore, posted periodically to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt
to forestall Frequently Asked Questions. This lexicon itself serves as a good
example of a collection of one kind of lore, although it is far too big for a
regular posting. Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?" and "What's
that funny name for the `#' character?" are both Frequently Asked Questions.
Several extant FAQ lists do (or should) make reference to the Jargon File
(the on-line version of this lexicon).
