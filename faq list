 FAQ LIST /ef-ay-kyoo list/ [Usenix] n. Compendium of accumulated lore,
posted periodically to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt to forestall
Frequently Asked Questions. The jargon file itself serves as a good example
of a collection of one kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular
posting. Several extant FAQ lists do (or should) make reference to the jargon
file. "How do you pronounce `char'?" and "What's that funny name for the `#'
character?" are, for example, both Frequently Asked Questions.
