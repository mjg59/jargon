 :N: /N/ quant. 1. A large and indeterminate number of objects: "There were N
bugs in that crock!" Also used in its original sense of a variable name:
"This crock has N bugs, as N goes to infinity." (The true number of bugs is
always at least N + 1.) 2. A variable whose value is inherited from the
current context. For example, when a meal is being ordered at a restaurant, N
may be understood to mean however many people there are at the table. From
the remark "We'd like to order N wonton soups and a family dinner for N - 1"
you can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only soup, even
though you don't know how many people there are (see {great-wall}). 3. `Nth':
adj. The ordinal counterpart of N, senses 1 and 2. "Now for the Nth and last
time..." In the specific context "Nth-year grad student", N is generally
assumed to be at least 4, and is usually 5 or more (see {tenured graduate
student}). see also {{random numbers}}, {two-to-the-N}.
