 NS32000 and several variants. At one point early in the great microprocessor
race, the specs on these chips made them look like serious competition for
the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0 series. Unfortunately, the actual
parts were notoriously flaky and never implemented the full instruction set
promised in their literature, apparently because the company couldn't get any
of the mask steppings to work as designed. They eventually sank without
trace, joining the Zilog Z8000 and a few even more obscure also-rans in the
graveyard of forgotten microprocessors. Compare {HP-SUX}, {AIDX}, {buglix},
{Macintrash}, {Telerat}, {ScumOS}, {sun-stools}, {Slowlaris}. :non-optimal
solution: n. (also `sub-optimal solution') An astoundingly stupid way to do
something. This term is generally used in deadpan sarcasm, as its impact is
greatest when the person speaking looks completely serious. Compare
{stunning}. see also {Bad Thing}. :nonlinear: adj. [scientific computation]
1. Behaving in an erratic and unpredictable fashion; unstable. When used to
describe the behavior of a machine or program, it suggests that said machine
or program is being forced to run far outside of design specifications. This
behavior may be induced by unreasonable inputs, or may be triggered when a
more mundane bug sends the computation far off from its expected course. 2.
When describing the behavior of a person, suggests a tantrum or a {flame}.
"When you talk to Bob, don't mention the drug problem or he'll go nonlinear
for hours." In this context, `go nonlinear' connotes `blow up out of
proportion' (proportion connotes linearity). :nontrivial: adj. Requiring real
thought or significant computing power. Often used as an understated way of
saying that a problem is quite difficult or impractical, or even entirely
unsolvable ("Proving P=NP is nontrivial"). The preferred emphatic form is
`decidedly nontrivial'. see {trivial}, {uninteresting}, {interesting}. :not
ready for prime time: adj. Usable, but only just so; not very robust; for
internal use only. Said of a program or device. Often connotes that the thing
will be made more solid {Real Soon Now}. This term comes from the ensemble
name of the original cast of "Saturday Night Live", the "Not Ready for Prime
Time Players". It has extra flavor for hackers because of the special (though
now semi-obsolescent) meaning of {prime time}. Compare {beta}. :notwork:
/not'werk/ n. A network, when it is acting {flaky} or is {down}. Compare
{nyetwork}. Said at IBM to have originally referred to a particular period of
flakiness on IBM's VNET corporate network ca. 1988; but there are independent
reports of the term from elsewhere. :NP-: /N-P/ pref. Extremely. Used to
modify adjectives describing a level or quality of difficulty; the
connotation is often `more so than it should be' This is generalized from the
computer-science terms `NP-hard' and `NP-complete'; NP-complete problems all
seem to be very hard, but so far no one has found a proof that they are. NP
is the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can be
completed by a nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of time that is a
polynomial function of the size of the input; a solution for one NP-complete
problem would solve all the others. "Coding a BitBlt implementation to
perform correctly in every case is NP-annoying." Note, however, that strictly
speaking this usage is misleading; there are plenty of easy problems in class
NP. NP-complete problems are hard not because they are in class NP, but
because they are the hardest problems in class NP. :nroff:: /N'rof/ n. [Unix,
from "new roff" (see {{troff}})] A companion program to the Unix typesetter
{{troff}}, accepting identical input but preparing output for terminals and
line printers. :NSA line eater: n. The National Security Agency trawling
program sometimes assumed to be reading the net for the U.S. Government's
spooks. Most hackers describe it as a mythical beast, but some believe it
actually exists, more aren't sure, and many believe in acting as though it
does exist just in case. Some netters put loaded phrases like `KGB', `Uzi',
`nuclear materials', `Palestine', `cocaine', and `assassination' in their
{sig block}s in a (probably futile) attempt to confuse and overload the
creature. The {GNU} version of {EMACS} actually has a command that randomly
inserts a bunch of insidious anarcho-verbiage into your edited text. There is
a mainstream variant of this myth involving a `Trunk Line Monitor', which
supposedly used speech recognition to extract words from telephone trunks.
This one was making the rounds in the late 1970s, spread by people who had no
idea of then-current technology or the storage, signal-processing, or speech
recognition needs of such a project. On the basis of mass-storage costs alone
it would have been cheaper to hire 50 high-school students and just let them
listen in. Speech-recognition technology can't do this job even now (1999),
and almost certainly won't in this millennium, either. The peak of silliness
came with a letter to an alternative paper in New Haven, Connecticut, laying
out the factoids of this Big Brotherly affair. The letter writer then
revealed his actual agenda by offering -- at an amazing low price, just this
once, we take VISA and MasterCard -- a scrambler guaranteed to daunt the
Trunk Trawler and presumably allowing the would-be Baader-Meinhof gangs of
the world to get on with their business. :NSP: /N-S-P/ n. Common abbreviation
for `Network Service Provider', one of the big national or regional companies
that maintains a portion of the Internet backbone and resells connectivity to
{ISP}s. In 1996, major NSPs include ANS, MCI, UUNET, and Sprint. An Internet
wholesaler. :nude: adj. Said of machines delivered without an operating
system (compare {bare metal}). "We ordered 50 systems, but they all arrived
nude, so we had to spend a an extra weekend with the installation disks."
This usage is a recent innovation reflecting the fact that most IBM-PC clones
are now delivered with an operating system pre-installed at the factory.
Other kinds of hardware are still normally delivered without OS, so this term
is particular to PC support groups. :nugry: /n[y]oo'gree/ [Usenet, 'newbie' +
'-gry'] `. n. A {newbie} who posts a {FAQ} in the rec.puzzles newsgroup,
especially if it is a variant of the notorious and unanswerable "What,
besides `angry' and `hungry', is the third common English word that ends in
-GRY?". In the newsgroup, the canonical answer is of course `nugry' itself.
Plural is `nusgry' /n[y]oos'gree/. 2. adj. Having the qualities of a nugry.
:nuke: /n[y]ook/ vt. [common] 1. To intentionally delete the entire contents
of a given directory or storage volume. "On Unix, `rm -r /usr' will nuke
everything in the usr filesystem." Never used for accidental deletion;
contrast {blow away}. 2. Syn. for {dike}, applied to smaller things such as
files, features, or code sections. Often used to express a final verdict.
"What do you want me to do with that 80-meg {wallpaper} file?" "Nuke it." 3.
Used of processes as well as files; nuke is a frequent verbal alias for `kill
-9' on Unix. 4. On IBM PCs, a bug that results in {fandango on core} can
trash the operating system, including the FAT (the in-core copy of the disk
block chaining information). This can utterly scramble attached disks, which
are then said to have been `nuked'. This term is also used of analogous
lossages on Macintoshes and other micros without memory protection.
:number-crunching: n. [common] Computations of a numerical nature, esp. those
that make extensive use of floating-point numbers. The only thing {Fortrash}
is good for. This term is in widespread informal use outside hackerdom and
even in mainstream slang, but has additional hackish connotations: namely,
that the computations are mindless and involve massive use of {brute force}.
This is not always {evil}, esp. if it involves ray tracing or fractals or
some other use that makes {pretty pictures}, esp. if such pictures can be
used as {wallpaper}. see also {crunch}. :numbers: n. [scientific computation]
Output of a computation that may not be significant results but at least
indicate that the program is running. May be used to placate management,
grant sponsors, etc. `Making numbers' means running a program because output
-- any output, not necessarily meaningful output -- is needed as a
demonstration of progress. see {pretty pictures}, {math-out}, {social science
number}. :NUXI problem: /nuk'see pro'bl*m/ n. Refers to the problem of
transferring data between machines with differing byte-order. The string
`UNIX' might look like `NUXI' on a machine with a different `byte sex' (e.g.,
when transferring data from a {little-endian} to a {big-endian}, or
vice-versa). see also {middle-endian}, {swab}, and {bytesexual}. :nybble:
/nib'l/ (alt. `nibble') n. [from v. `nibble' by analogy with `bite' =>
`byte'] Four bits; one {hex} digit; a half-byte. Though `byte' is now
techspeak, this useful relative is still jargon. Compare {{byte}}; see also
{bit}. The more mundane spelling "nibble" is also commonly used. Apparently
the `nybble' spelling is uncommon in Commonwealth Hackish, as British
orthography would suggest the pronunciation /ni:'bl/. Following `bit', `byte'
and `nybble' there have been quite a few analogical attempts to construct
unambiguous terms for bit blocks of other sizes. All of these are strictly
jargon, not techspeak, and not very common jargon at that (most hackers would
recognize them in context but not use them spontaneously). We collect them
here for reference together with the ambiguous techspeak terms `word',
`half-word' and `double word'; some (indicated) have substantial information
separate entries. 2 bits: {crumb}, {quad}, {quarter}, tayste 4 bits: nybble 5
bits: {nickle} 10 bits: {deckle} 16 bits: playte, {chawmp} (on a 32-bit
machine), word (on a 16-bit machine), half-word (on a 32-bit machine). 18
bits: {chawmp} (on a 36-bit machine), half-word (on a 36-bit machine) 32
bits: dynner, {gawble} (on a 32-bit machine), word (on a 32-bit machine),
longword (on a 16-bit machine). 36: word (on a 36-bit machine) 48 bits:
{gawble} (under circumstances that remain obscure) 64 bits double word (on a
32-bit machine) The fundamental motivation for most of these jargon terms
(aside from the normal hackerly enjoyment of punning wordplay) is the extreme
ambiguity of the term `word' and its derivatives. :nyetwork: /nyet'werk/ n.
[from Russian `nyet' = no] A network, when it is acting {flaky} or is {down}.
Compare {notwork}. = O = ===== :Ob-: /ob/ pref. Obligatory. A piece of
{netiquette} acknowledging that the author has been straying from the
newsgroup's charter topic. For example, if a posting in alt.sex is a response
to a part of someone else's posting that has nothing particularly to do with
sex, the author may append `ObSex' (or `Obsex') and toss off a question or
vignette about some unusual erotic act. It is considered a sign of great
{winnitude} when one's Obs are more interesting than other people's whole
postings. :Obfuscated C Contest: n. (in full, the `International Obfuscated C
Code Contest', or IOCCC) An annual contest run since 1984 over Usenet by
Landon Curt Noll and friends. The overall winner is whoever produces the most
unreadable, creative, and bizarre (but working) C program; various other
prizes are awarded at the judges' whim. C's terse syntax and
macro-preprocessor facilities give contestants a lot of maneuvering room. The
winning programs often manage to be simultaneously (a) funny, (b)
breathtaking works of art, and (c) horrible examples of how _not_ to code in
C. This relatively short and sweet entry might help convey the flavor of
obfuscated C: /* * HELLO WORLD program * by Jack Applin and Robert
Heckendorn, 1985 * (Note: depends on being able to modify elements of argv[],
* which is not guaranteed by ANSI and often not possible.) */
main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]="Hello, world!\n)";
(!!c)[*c]&&(v--||--c&&execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));
**c=!c)write(!!*c,*c,!!**c);} Here's another good one: /* * Program to
compute an approximation of pi * by Brian Westley, 1988 * (requires pcc macro
concatenation; try gcc -traditional-cpp) */ #define _ -F<00||--F-OO--; int
F=00,OO=00; main(){F_OO();printf("%1.3f\n",4.*-F/OO/OO);}F_OO() { _-_-_-_
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_
_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ _-_-_-_ }
Note that this program works by computing its own area. For more digits,
write a bigger program. see also {hello world}. The IOCCC has an official
home page at `http://www.ioccc.org'. :obi-wan error: /oh'bee-won` er'*r/ n.
[RPI, from `off-by-one' and the Obi-Wan Kenobi character in "Star Wars"] A
loop of some sort in which the index is off by 1. Common when the index
should have started from 0 but instead started from 1. A kind of {off-by-one
error}. see also {zeroth}. :Objectionable-C: n. Hackish take on
"Objective-C", the name of an object-oriented dialect of C in competition
with the better-known C++ (it is used to write native applications on the
NeXT machine). Objectionable-C uses a Smalltalk-like syntax, but lacks the
flexibility of Smalltalk method calls, and (like many such efforts) comes
frustratingly close to attaining the {Right Thing} without actually doing so.
:obscure: adj. Used in an exaggeration of its normal meaning, to imply total
incomprehensibility. "The reason for that last crash is obscure." "The
`find(1)' command's syntax is obscure!" The phrase `moderately obscure'
implies that something could be figured out but probably isn't worth the
trouble. The construction `obscure in the extreme' is the preferred emphatic
form. :octal forty: /ok'tl for'tee/ n. Hackish way of saying "I'm drawing a
blank." Octal 40 is the {{ASCII}} space character, 0100000; by an odd
coincidence, {hex} 40 (01000000) is the {{EBCDIC}} space character. see
{wall}. :off the trolley: adj. Describes the behavior of a program that
malfunctions and goes catatonic, but doesn't actually {crash} or abort. see
{glitch}, {bug}, {deep space}, {wedged}. This term is much older than
computing, and is (uncommon) slang elsewhere. A trolley is the small wheel
that trolls, or runs against, the heavy wire that carries the current to run
a streetcar. It's at the end of the long pole (the trolley pole) that reaches
from the roof of the streetcar to the overhead line. When the trolley stops
making contact with the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy
track, or whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without
crashing. The streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire.
Later on, trolley came to mean the streetcar itself. Since streetcars became
common in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years old. Nowadays, trolleys
are only seen on historic streetcars, since modern streetcars use pantographs
to contact the wire. :off-by-one error: n. [common] Exceedingly common error
induced in many ways, such as by starting at 0 when you should have started
at 1 or vice-versa, or by writing `< N' instead of `<= N' or vice-versa. Also
applied to giving something to the person next to the one who should have
gotten it. Often confounded with {fencepost error}, which is properly a
particular subtype of it. :offline: adv. Not now or not here. "Let's take
this discussion offline." Specifically used on {Usenet} to suggest that a
discussion be moved off a public newsgroup to email. :ogg: /og/ v. [CMU] 1.
In the multi-player space combat game Netrek, to execute kamikaze attacks
against enemy ships which are carrying armies or occupying strategic
positions. Named during a game in which one of the players repeatedly used
the tactic while playing Orion ship G, showing up in the player list as "Og".
This trick has been roundly denounced by those who would return to the good
old days when the tactic of dogfighting was dominant, but as Sun Tzu wrote,
"What is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy, not
his tactics." However, the traditional answer to the newbie question "What
does ogg mean?" is just "Pick up some armies and I'll show you." 2. In other
games, to forcefully attack an opponent with the expectation that the
resources expended will be renewed faster than the opponent will be able to
regain his previous advantage. Taken more seriously as a tactic since it has
gained a simple name. 3. To do anything forcefully, possibly without
consideration of the drain on future resources. "I guess I'd better go ogg
the problem set that's due tomorrow." "Whoops! I looked down at the map for a
sec and almost ogged that oncoming car." :-oid: suff. [from Gree suffix -oid
= `in the image of'] 1. Used as in mainstream slang English to indicate a
poor imitation, a counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.
Hackers will happily use it with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that
wouldn't keep company with it in mainstream English. For example, "He's a
nerdoid" means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't make the
grade; a `modemoid' might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems run at 28.8 or up);
a `computeroid' might be any {bitty box}. The word `keyboid' could be used to
describe a {chiclet keyboard}, but would have to be written; spoken, it would
confuse the listener as to the speaker's city of origin. 2. More
specifically, an indicator for `resembling an android' which in the past has
been confined to science-fiction fans and hackers. It too has recently (in
1991) started to go mainstream (most notably in the term `trendoid' for
victims of terminal hipness). This is probably traceable to the
popularization of the term {droid} in "Star Wars" and its sequels. (see also
{windoid}.) Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
least fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have probably been
making `-oid' jargon for almost that long [though GLS and I can personally
confirm only that they were already common in the mid-1970s --ESR]. :old
fart: n. Tribal elder. A title self-assumed with remarkable frequency by
(esp.) Usenetters who have been programming for more than about 25 years;
often appears in {sig block}s attached to Jargon File contributions of great
archeological significance. This is a term of insult in the second or third
person but one of pride in first person. :Old Testament: n. [C programmers]
The first edition of {K&R}, the sacred text describing {Classic C}.
:one-banana problem: n. At mainframe shops, where the computers have
operators for routine administrivia, the programmers and hardware people tend
to look down on the operators and claim that a trained monkey could do their
job. It is frequently observed that the incentives that would be offered said
monkeys can be used as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task. A
one-banana problem is simple; hence, "It's only a one-banana job at the most;
what's taking them so long?" At IBM, folklore divides the world into one-,
two-, and three-banana problems. Other cultures have different hierarchies
and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five grapes (a bunch)
equals a banana. Their upper limit for the in-house {sysape}s is said to be
two bananas and three grapes (another source claims it's three bananas and
one grape, but observes "However, this is subject to local variations, cosmic
rays and ISO"). At a complication level any higher than that, one asks the
manufacturers to send someone around to check things. see also
{Infinite-Monkey Theorem}. :one-line fix: n. Used (often sarcastically) of a
change to a program that is thought to be trivial or insignificant right up
to the moment it crashes the system. Usually `cured' by another one-line fix.
see also {I didn't change anything!} :one-liner wars: n. A game popular among
hackers who code in the language APL (see {write-only language} and {line
noise}). The objective is to see who can code the most interesting and/or
useful routine in one line of operators chosen from APL's exceedingly {hairy}
primitive set. A similar amusement was practiced among {TECO} hackers and is
now popular among {Perl} aficionados. Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL, has
been credited with a one-liner that, given a number N, produces a list of the
prime numbers from 1 to N inclusive. It looks like this: (2 = 0 +.= T o.| T)
/ T <- iN where `o' is the APL null character, the assignment arrow is a
single character, and `i' represents the APL iota. Here's equivalent {Perl}:
perl -le '$_ = 1; (1 x $_) !~ /^(11+)\1+$/ && print while $_++' :ooblick:
/oo'blik/ n. [from the Dr. Seuss title "Bartholomew and the Oobleck"; the
spelling `oobleck' is still current in the mainstream] A bizarre semi-liquid
sludge made from cornstarch and water. Enjoyed among hackers who make batches
during playtime at parties for its amusing and extremely non-Newtonian
behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid motion like a solid and
will even crack when hit by a hammer. Often found near lasers. Here is a
field-tested ooblick recipe contributed by GLS: 1 cup cornstarch 1 cup baking
soda 3/4 cup water N drops of food coloring This recipe isn't quite as
non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch ooblick, but has an appropriately slimy
feel. Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick _recipe_ is far too
mechanical, and that it is best to add the water in small increments so that
the various mixed states the cornstarch goes through as it _becomes_ ooblick
can be grokked in fullness by many hands. For optional ingredients of this
experience, see the "{Ceremonial Chemicals}" section of Appendix B. :op: /op/
n. 1. In England and Ireland, common verbal abbreviation for `operator', as
in system operator. Less common in the U.S., where {sysop} seems to be
preferred. 2. [IRC] Someone who is endowed with privileges on {IRC}, not
limited to a particular channel. These are generally people who are in charge
of the IRC server at their particular site. Sometimes used interchangeably
with {CHOP}. Compare {sysop}. :open: n. Abbreviation for `open (or left)
parenthesis' -- used when necessary to eliminate oral ambiguity. To read
aloud the LISP form (DEFUN FOO (X) (PLUS X 1)) one might say: "Open defun
foo, open eks close, open, plus eks one, close close." :open source: n.
[common; also adj. `open-source'] Term coined in March 1998 following the
Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source under licenses
guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and redistribute, the
code. The intent was to be able to sell the hackers' ways of doing software
to industry and the mainstream by avoid the negative connotations (to
{suit}s) of the term "free software". For discussion of the followon tactics
and their consequences, see the Open Source Initiative
(http://www.opensource.org) site. :open switch: n. [IBM: prob. from
railroading] An unresolved question, issue, or problem. :operating system::
n. [techspeak] (Often abbreviated `OS') The foundation software of a machine;
that which schedules tasks, allocates storage, and presents a default
interface to the user between applications. The facilities an operating
system provides and its general design philosophy exert an extremely strong
influence on programming style and on the technical cultures that grow up
around its host machines. Hacker folklore has been shaped primarily by the
{{Unix}}, {{ITS}}, {{TOPS-10}}, {{TOPS-20}}/{{TWENEX}}, {{WAITS}}, {{CP/M}},
{{MS-DOS}}, and {{Multics}} operating systems (most importantly by ITS and
Unix). :optical diff: n. see {vdiff}. :optical grep: n. see {vgrep}.
:optimism: n. What a programmer is full of after fixing the last bug and
before discovering the _next_ last bug. Fred Brooks's book "The Mythical
Man-Month" (see "Brooks's Law") contains the following paragraph that
describes this extremely well: All programmers are optimists. Perhaps this
modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and
fairy godmothers. Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all
but those who habitually focus on the end goal. Perhaps it is merely that
computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always
optimists. But however the selection process works, the result is
indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last
bug.". see also {Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology}. :Orange Book: n.
The U.S. Government's standards document "Trusted Computer System Evaluation
Criteria, DOD standard
