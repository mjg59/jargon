 N /en/ adj. 1. Some large and indeterminate number of objects; "There were N
bugs in that crock!"; also used in its original sense of a variable name. 2.
An arbitrarily large (and perhaps infinite) number; "This crock has N bugs,
as N goes to infinity". 3. A variable whose value is specified by the current
context. For example, when ordering a meal at a restaurant N may be
understood to mean however many people there are at the table. From the
remark "We'd like to order N wonton soups and a family dinner for N-1." you
can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only soup, even though
you don't know how many people there are. A silly riddle: "How many computers
does it take to shift the bits in a register? N+1: N to hold all the bits
still, and one to shove the register over." 4. NTH: adj. The ordinal
counterpart of N. "Now for the Nth and last time..." In the specific context
"Nth-year grad student", N is generally assumed to be at least 4, and is
usually 5 or more. see also RANDOM NUMBERS, TWO-TO-THE-N.
