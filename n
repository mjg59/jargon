 1 cup cornstarch 1 cup baking soda 3/4 cup water N drops of food coloring
This recipe isn't quite as non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch ooblick, but
has an appropriately slimy feel. Some, however, insist that the notion of an
ooblick *recipe* is far too mechanical, and that it is best to add the water
in small increments so that the various mixed states the cornstarch goes
through as it *becomes* ooblick can be grokked in fullness by many hands. For
optional ingredients of this experience, see the "{Ceremonial Chemicals}"
section of Appendix B.
