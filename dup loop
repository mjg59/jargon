 :dup loop: /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop') [FidoNet] n. An infinite stream
of duplicated, near-identical messages on a FidoNet {echo}, the only
difference being unique or mangled identification information applied by a
faulty or incorrectly configured system or network gateway, thus rendering
{dup killer}s ineffective. If such a duplicate message eventually reaches a
system through which it has already passed (with the original identification
information), all systems passed on the way back to that system are said to
be involved in a {dup loop}.
