 :dup loop: /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop') [FidoNet] n. An incorrectly
configured system or network gateway may propagate duplicate messages on one
or more {echo}es, with different identification information that renders {dup
killer}s ineffective. If such a duplicate message eventually reaches a system
through which it has already passed (with the original identification
information), all systems passed on the way back to that system are said to
be involved in a {dup loop}.
