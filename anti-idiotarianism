 :anti-idiotarianism: n. [very common] Opposition to idiots of all political
stripes. First coined in the {blog} named Little Green Footballs as part of a
post expressing disgust with inane responses to post-9/11 Islamic terrorism.
Anti-idiotarian wrath has focused on Islamic terrorists and their
sympathizers in the Western political left, but also routinely excoriated
right-wing politicians backing repressive 'anti-terror` legislation and
Christian religious figures who (in the blogosphere's view of the matter)
have descended nearly to the level of jihad themselves.
