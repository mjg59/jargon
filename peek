 :peek: n.,vt. (and {poke}) The commands in most microcomputer BASICs for
directly accessing memory contents at an absolute address; often extended to
mean the corresponding constructs in any {HLL} (peek reads memory, poke
modifies it). Much hacking on small, non-MMU micros used to consist of
`peek'ing around memory, more or less at random, to find the location where
the system keeps interesting stuff. Long (and variably accurate) lists of
such addresses for various computers circulated (see {{interrupt list}}). The
results of `poke's at these addresses may be highly useful, mildly amusing,
useless but neat, or (most likely) total {lossage} (see {killer poke}). Since
a {real operating system} provides useful, higher-level services for the
tasks commonly performed with peeks and pokes on micros, and real languages
tend not to encourage low-level memory groveling, a question like "How do I
do a peek in C?" is diagnostic of the {newbie}. (Of course, OS kernels often
have to do exactly this; a real kernel hacker would unhesitatingly, if
unportably, assign an absolute address to a pointer variable and indirect
through it.)
