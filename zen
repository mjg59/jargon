 :zen: vt. To figure out something by meditation or by a sudden flash of
enlightenment. Originally applied to bugs, but occasionally applied to
problems of life in general. "How'd you figure out the buffer allocation
problem?" "Oh, I zenned it." Contrast {grok}, which connotes a time-extended
version of zenning a system. Compare {hack mode}. see also {guru}.
