 ZEN v. To figure out something by meditation, or by a sudden flash of
enlightenment. Originally applied to bugs, but occasionally applied to
problems of life in general. "How'd you figure out the buffer allocation
problem?" "Oh, I zenned it". Contrast GROK, which connotes a time-extended
version of zenning a system. Compare HACK MODE.
