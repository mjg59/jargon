 0111011). :Weenix: /wee'niks/ n. 1. [ITS] A derogatory term for {{Unix}},
derived from {Unix weenie}. According to one noted ex-ITSer, it is "the
operating system preferred by Unix Weenies: typified by poor modularity, poor
reliability, hard file deletion, no file version numbers, case sensitivity
everywhere, and users who believe that these are all advantages". (Some ITS
fans behave as though they believe Unix stole a future that rightfully
belonged to them. see {{ITS}}, sense 2.) 2. [Brown University] A Unix-like OS
developed for tutorial purposes at Brown University. see
`http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html'. Named independently of
the ITS usage. :well-behaved: adj. 1. [primarily {{MS-DOS}}] Said of software
conforming to system interface guidelines and standards. Well-behaved
software uses the operating system to do chores such as keyboard input,
allocating memory and drawing graphics. Oppose {ill-behaved}. 2. Software
that does its job quietly and without counterintuitive effects. Esp. said of
software having an interface spec sufficiently simple and well-defined that
it can be used as a {tool} by other software. see {cat}. 3. Said of an
algorithm that doesn't {crash} or {blow up}, even when given {pathological}
input. Implies that the stability of the algorithm is intrinsic, which makes
this somewhat different from {bulletproof}. :well-connected: adj. Said of a
computer installation, asserts that it has reliable email links with the
network and/or that it relays a large fraction of available {Usenet}
newsgroups. `Well-known' can be almost synonymous, but also implies that the
site's name is familiar to many (due perhaps to an archive service or active
Usenet users). :wetware: /wet'weir/ n. [prob. from the novels of Rudy Rucker]
1. The human nervous system, as opposed to computer hardware or software.
"Wetware has 7 plus or minus 2 temporary registers." 2. Human beings
(programmers, operators, administrators) attached to a computer system, as
opposed to the system's hardware or software. see {liveware}, {meatware}.
:whack: v. According to arch-hacker James Gosling (designer of {NeWS},
{GOSMACS} and Java), to "...modify a program with no idea whatsoever how it
works." (see {whacker}.) It is actually possible to do this in nontrivial
circumstances if the change is small and well-defined and you are very good
at {glark}ing things from context. As a trivial example, it is relatively
easy to change all `stderr' writes to `stdout' writes in a piece of C filter
code which remains otherwise mysterious. :whack-a-mole: n. [Usenet] The
practice of repeatedly causing spammers' {throwaway account}s and drop boxes
to be terminated. Named for the carnival game which involves quickly and
repeatedly hitting the heads of mechanical moles with a mallet as they pop up
from their holes. :whacker: n. [University of Maryland: from {hacker}] 1. A
person, similar to a {hacker}, who enjoys exploring the details of
programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities. Whereas a hacker
tends to produce great hacks, a whacker only ends up whacking the system or
program in question. Whackers are often quite egotistical and eager to claim
{wizard} status, regardless of the views of their peers. 2. A person who is
good at programming quickly, though rather poorly and ineptly. :whales: n.
see {like kicking dead whales down the beach}. :whalesong: n. The peculiar
clicking and whooshing sounds made by a PEP modem such as the Telebit
Trailblazer as it tries to synchronize with another PEP modem for their
special high-speed mode. This sound isn't anything like the normal two-tone
handshake between conventional V-series modems and is instantly recognizable
to anyone who has heard it more than once. It sounds, in fact, very much like
whale songs. This noise is also called "the moose call" or "moose tones".
:What's a spline?: [XEROX PARC] This phrase expands to: "You have just used a
term that I've heard for a year and a half, and I feel I should know, but
don't. My curiosity has finally overcome my guilt." The PARC lexicon adds
"Moral: don't hesitate to ask questions, even if they seem obvious." :wheel:
n. [from slang `big wheel' for a powerful person] A person who has an active
{wheel bit}. "We need to find a wheel to unwedge the hung tape drives." (see
{wedged}, sense 1.) The traditional name of security group zero in {BSD} (to
which the major system-internal users like {root} belong) is `wheel'. Some
vendors have expanded on this usage, modifying Unix so that only members of
group `wheel' can {go root}. :wheel bit: n. A privilege bit that allows the
possessor to perform some restricted operation on a timesharing system, such
as read or write any file on the system regardless of protections, change or
look at any address in the running monitor, crash or reload the system, and
kill or create jobs and user accounts. The term was invented on the TENEX
operating system, and carried over to TOPS-20, XEROX-IFS, and others. The
state of being in a privileged logon is sometimes called `wheel mode'. This
term entered the Unix culture from TWENEX in the mid-1980s and has been
gaining popularity there (esp. at university sites). see also {root}. :wheel
wars: n. [Stanford University] A period in {larval stage} during which
student hackers hassle each other by attempting to log each other out of the
system, delete each other's files, and otherwise wreak havoc, usually at the
expense of the lesser users. :White Book: n. 1. Syn. {K&R}. 2. Adobe's fourth
book in the PostScript series, describing the previously-secret format of
Type 1 fonts; "Adobe Type 1 Font Format, version 1.1", (Addison-Wesley,
