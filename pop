 POP also POPJ (pop-jay) [based on the stack operation that removes the top
of a stack, and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on the
stack] v. To return from a digression (the J-form derives from a PDP-10
assembler instruction). By verb doubling, "Popj, popj" means roughly, "Now
let's see, where were we?" see RTI.
