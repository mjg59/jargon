 :pop: /pop/ [from the operation that removes the top of a stack, and the
fact that procedure return addresses are usually saved on the stack] (also
capitalized `POP') 1. vt. To remove something from a {stack}. If a person
says he/she has popped something from his stack, that means he/she has
finally finished working on it and can now remove it from the list of things
hanging overhead. 2. When a discussion gets to a level of detail so deep that
the main point of the discussion is being lost, someone will shout "Pop!",
meaning "Get back up to a higher level!" The shout is frequently accompanied
by an upthrust arm with a finger pointing to the ceiling. 3. [all-caps, as
`POP'] Point of Presence, a bank of dial-in lines allowing customers to make
(local) calls into an ISP. This is borderline techspeak.
