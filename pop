 POP also POPJ /pop-jay/ [based on the stack operation that removes the top
of a stack, and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on the
stack] 1. v. To remove something from a stack or PDL. If a person says he has
popped something from his pdl, he means he has finally finished working on it
and can now remove it from the list of things hanging over his head. 2. To
return from a digression (the J-form derives specifically from a PDP-10
assembler instruction). By verb doubling, "Popj, popj" means roughly, "Now
let's see, where were we?" see RTI.
