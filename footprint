 :footprint: /n./ 1. The floor or desk area taken up by a piece of hardware.
2. [IBM] The audit trail (if any) left by a crashed program (often in plural,
`footprints'). see also {toeprint}. 3. "RAM footprint": The minimum amount of
RAM which an OS or other program takes; this figure gives one one an idea of
how much will be left for other applications. How actively this RAM is used
is another matter entirely. Recent tendencies to featuritis and software
bloat can expand the RAM footprint of an OS to the point of making it nearly
unusable in practice. [This problem is, thankfully, limited to operating
systems so stupid that they don't do virtual memory -- ESR]
