 :AI-complete: /A·I k@m·pleet'/, adj. [MIT, Stanford: by analogy with
NP-complete (see {NP-})] Used to describe problems or subproblems in AI, to
indicate that the solution presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem'
(that is, the synthesis of a human-level intelligence). A problem that is
AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard. Examples of AI-complete
problems are `The Vision Problem' (building a system that can see as well as
a human) and `The Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can
understand and speak a natural language as well as a human). These may appear
to be modular, but all attempts so far (2002) to solve them have foundered on
the amount of context information and `intelligence' they seem to require.
