 APP (ap) n. Short for `application program', as opposed to a systems
program. What systems vendors are forever chasing developers to do for their
environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to think of the
things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term
excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
user would consider all those apps. Oppose TOOL, OPERATING SYSTEM.
