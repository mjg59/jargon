 :troll: /v.,n./ [From the Usenet group alt.folklore.urban] To utter a
posting on {Usenet} designed to attract predictable responses or {flame}s.
Derives from the phrase "trolling for {newbie}s" which in turn comes from
mainstream "trolling", a style of fishing in which one trails bait through a
likely spot hoping for a bite. The well-constructed troll is a post that
induces lots of newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more
clueless than they already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy and
experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll. If you don't fall for the
joke, you get to be in on it. Some people claim that the troll is properly a
narrower category than {flame bait}, that a troll is categorized by
containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly controversial.
