 :troll: v.,n. To utter a posting on {Usenet} designed to attract stupid
responses or {flame}s. May derive from the phrase "trolling for {newbie}s" or
some similar construction. The well-constructed troll is a post that induces
lots of newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more like idiots
than they already do, while subtly conveying to the more savvy and
experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll. If you don't fall for the
joke, you get to be in on it. Some people claim that the troll is properly a
narrower category than {flame bait}, that a troll is categorized by
containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly controversial.
