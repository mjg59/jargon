 DAEMON /day'mun/ or /dee'mun/ [Disk And Execution MONitor] n. A program
which is not invoked explicitly, but which lies dormant waiting for some
condition(s) to occur. The idea is that the perpetrator of the condition need
not be aware that a daemon is lurking (though often a program will commit an
action only because it knows that it will implicitly invoke a daemon). For
example, under ITS writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory would invoke
the spooling daemon, which prints the file. The advantage is that programs
which want (in this example) files printed need not compete for access to the
lpt. They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what
to do with them. Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and
may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals. Usage: DAEMON and
DEMON (q.v.) are often used interchangeably, but seem to have distinct
connotations. DAEMON was introduced to computing by CTSS people (who
pronounced it dee'mon) and used it to refer to what is now called a DRAGON or
PHANTOM (q.v.). The meaning and pronunciation have drifted, and we think this
glossary reflects current usage.
