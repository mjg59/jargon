 :knurd: n. 1. [RPI] Renssaleer Polytechnic Institute local slang roughly
equivalent to the positive sense of {geek}, referring to people who prefer
technical hobbies to socializing. 2. In older usage at RPI, the term
signified someone new to college life, fresh out of high school, and wet
behind the ears. An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd'
in its variant form `knurd' from the word `drunk' backwards; this etymology
was common at RPI. Though it is commonly confused with {nerd}, it appears
these words have separate origins (compare the {kluge}/{kludge} pair).
