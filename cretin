 :cretin: /kret'in/ or /kree'tn/ n. Congenital {loser}; an obnoxious person;
someone who can't do anything right. It has been observed that many American
hackers tend to favor the British pronunciation /kret'in/ over standard
American /kree'tn/; it is thought this may be due to the insidious phonetic
influence of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
