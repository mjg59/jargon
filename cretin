 CRETIN /kre'tn/ or /kree'tn/ n. Congenital LOSER (q.v.); an obnoxious
person; someone who can't do anything right. It has been observed that
American hackers tend to favor the British pronunciation /kret'n/ over
standard American /kreet'n/; it is thought this may be due to the phonetic
influence Monty Python's Flying Circus.
