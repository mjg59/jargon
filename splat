 :splat: n. 1. Name used in many places (DEC, IBM, and others) for the
asterisk (`*') character (ASCII 0101010). This may derive from the
`squashed-bug' appearance of the asterisk on many early line printers. 2.
[MIT] Name used by some people for the `#' character (ASCII 0100011). 3.
[Rochester Institute of Technology] The {feature key} on a Mac (same as
{alt}, sense 2). 4. [Stanford] Name used by some people for the Stanford/ITS
extended ASCII circle-x character. This character is also called `blobby' and
`frob', among other names; it is sometimes used by mathematicians as a
notation for `tensor product'. 5. [Stanford] Name for the semi-mythical
extended ASCII circle-plus character. 6. Canonical name for an output routine
that outputs whatever the local interpretation of `splat' is. With ITS and
WAITS gone, senses 4--6 are now nearly obsolete. see also {{ASCII}}.
