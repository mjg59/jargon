 :mod: vt.,n. [very common] 1. Short for `modify' or `modification'. Very
commonly used -- in fact the full terms are considered markers that one is
being formal. The plural `mods' is used esp. with reference to bug fixes or
minor design changes in hardware or software, most esp. with respect to
{patch} sets or a {diff}. 2. Short for {modulo} but used _only_ for its
techspeak sense.
