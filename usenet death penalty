 :Usenet Death Penalty: [Usenet] A sanction against sites that habitually
spew Usenet {spam}. This can be either passive or active. A passive UDP
refers to the dropping of all postings by a particular domain so as to
inhibit propagation. An active UDP refers to third-party cancellation of all
postings by the UDPed domain. A partial UDP is one which applies only to
certain newsgroups or hierarchies in Usenet. Compare {Internet Death
Penalty}, with which this term is sometimes confused.
