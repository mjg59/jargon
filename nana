 :NANA: // [Usenet] The newsgroups news.admin.net-abuse.*, devoted to
fighting {spam} and network abuse. Each individual newsgroup is often
referred to by adding a letter to NANA. For example, NANAU would refer to
news.admin.net-abuse.usenet. When spam began to be a serious problem around
1995, and a loose network of anti-spammers formed to combat it, spammers
immediately accused them of being the {backbone cabal}, or the Cabal reborn.
Though this was not true, spam-fighters ironically accepted the label and the
tag line "There is No Cabal" reappeared (later, and now commonly, abbreviated
to "TINC"). Nowadays "the Cabal" is generally understood to refer to the NANA
regulars.
