 :talk mode: /n./ A feature supported by Unix, ITS, and some other OSes that
allows two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line
conversation. It combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision
(and verbosity) that written language entails. It is difficult to communicate
inflection, though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section
on writing style in the Prependices for details). Talk mode has a special set
of jargon words, used to save typing, which are not used orally. Some of
these are identical to (and probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by
ham-radio amateurs since the 1920s.
