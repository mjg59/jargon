 :talk mode: n. A feature supported by UNIX, ITS, and some other OSes that
allows two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line
conversation. It combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision
(and verbosity) that written language entails. It is difficult to communicate
inflection, though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section
on writing style in the Prependices for details). Talk mode has a special set
of jargon words, used to save typing, which are not used orally. Some of
these are identical to (and probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by
ham-radio amateurs since the 1920s. BCNU be seeing you BTW by the way BYE?
are you ready to unlink? (this is the standard way to end a talk-mode
conversation; the other person types `BYE' to confirm, or else continues the
conversation) CUL see you later ENQ? are you busy? (expects `ACK' or `NAK' in
return) FOO? are you there? (often used on unexpected links, meaning also
"Sorry if I butted in ..." (linker) or "What's up?" (linkee)) FYI for your
information FYA for your amusement GA go ahead (used when two people have
tried to type simultaneously; this cedes the right to type to the other)
GRMBL grumble (expresses disquiet or disagreement) HELLOP hello? (an instance
of the `-P' convention) JAM just a minute (equivalent to `SEC....') MIN same
as `JAM' NIL no (see {NIL}) O over to you OO over and out / another form of
"over to you" (from x/y as "x over y") \ lambda (used in discussing LISPy
things) OBTW oh, by the way R U THERE? are you there? SEC wait a second
(sometimes written `SEC...') T yes (see the main entry for {T}) TNX thanks
TNX 1.0E6 thanks a million (humorous) TNXE6 another form of "thanks a
million" WRT with regard to, or with respect to. WTF the universal
interrogative particle; WTF knows what it means? WTH what the hell? <double
newline> When the typing party has finished, he/she types two newlines to
signal that he/she is done; this leaves a blank line between `speeches' in
the conversation, making it easier to reread the preceding text. <name>: When
three or more terminals are linked, it is conventional for each typist to
{prepend} his/her login name or handle and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line
to indicate who is typing (some conferencing facilities do this
automatically). The login name is often shortened to a unique prefix
(possibly a single letter) during a very long conversation. /\/\/\ A giggle
or chuckle. On a MUD, this usually means `earthquake fault'. Most of the
above sub-jargon is used at both Stanford and MIT. Several of these
expressions are also common in {email}, esp. FYI, FYA, BTW, BCNU, WTF, and
CUL. A few other abbreviations have been reported from commercial networks,
such as GEnie and CompuServe, where on-line `live' chat including more than
two people is common and usually involves a more `social' context, notably
the following: <g> grin <gr&d> grinning, running, and ducking BBL be back
later BRB be right back HHOJ ha ha only joking HHOK ha ha only kidding HHOS
{ha ha only serious} IMHO in my humble opinion (see {IMHO}) LOL laughing out
loud NHOH Never Heard of Him/Her (often used in {initgame}) ROTF rolling on
the floor ROTFL rolling on the floor laughing AFK away from keyboard b4
before CU l8tr see you later MORF male or female? TTFN ta-ta for now TTYL
talk to you later OIC oh, I see rehi hello again Most of these are not used
at universities or in the UNIX world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some
currency there and IMHO is common; conversely, most of the people who know
these are unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, {NIL}, and {T}. The {MUD}
community uses a mixture of USENET/Internet emoticons, a few of the more
natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the `social' list
above; specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW,
WTF, TTFN, and WTH. The use of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are
fond of re- compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see
{bonk/oif}) people. The word `re' by itself is taken as `regreet'. In
general, though, MUDders express a preference for typing things out in full
rather than using abbreviations; this may be due to the relative youth of the
MUD cultures, which tend to include many touch typists and to assume
high-speed links. The following uses specific to MUDs are reported: UOK? are
you OK? THX thanks (mutant of `TNX'; clearly this comes in batches of 1138
(the Lucasian K)). CU l8er see you later (mutant of `CU l8tr') OTT over the
top (excessive, uncalled for) FOAD fuck off and die (use of this is often
OTT) Some {BIFF}isms (notably the variant spelling `d00d') appear to be
passing into wider use among some subgroups of MUDders. One final note on
talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often seem to think they must
produce letter-perfect prose because they are typing rather than speaking.
This is not the best approach. It can be very frustrating to wait while your
partner pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling
error and backs up to fix it. It is usually best just to leave typographical
errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that
case it is often fastest just to type "xxx" and start over from before the
mistake. see also {hakspek}, {emoticon}, {bonk/oif}.
