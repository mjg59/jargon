 :talk mode: n. A feature supported by Unix and some other OSes that allows
two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation. It
combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that
written language entails. It is difficult to communicate inflection, though
conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on writing style
in the Prependices for details). Talk mode has a special set of jargon words,
used to save typing, which are not used orally. Some of these are identical
to (and probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs
since the 1920s. AFAIAC as far as I am concerned AFAIK as far as I know BCNU
be seeing you BTW by the way BYE? are you ready to unlink? (this is the
standard way to end a talk-mode conversation; the other person types BYE to
confirm, or else continues the conversation) CUL see you later ENQ? are you
busy? (expects ACK or NAK in return) FOO? are you there? (often used on
unexpected links, meaning also "Sorry if I butted in &ellipsis;" (linker) or
"What's up?" (linkee)) FWIW for what it's worth FYI for your information FYA
for your amusement GA go ahead (used when two people have tried to type
simultaneously; this cedes the right to type to the other) GRMBL grumble
(expresses disquiet or disagreement) HELLOP hello? (an instance of the `-P'
convention) IIRC if I recall correctly JAM just a minute (equivalent to
SEC.... ) MIN same as JAM NIL no (see {NIL}) NP no problem O over to you OO
over and out / another form of "over to you" (from x/y as "x over y") \
lambda (used in discussing LISPy things) OBTW oh, by the way OTOH on the
other hand R U THERE? are you there? SEC wait a second (sometimes written
SEC... ) SYN Are you busy? (expects ACK, SYN|ACK, or RST in return; this is
modeled on the TCP/IP handshake sequence) T yes (see the main entry for {T})
TNX thanks TNX 1.0E6 thanks a million (humorous) TNXE6 another form of
"thanks a million" TTBOMK to the best of my knowledge WRT with regard to, or
with respect to. WTF the universal interrogative particle; WTF knows what it
means? WTH what the hell? <double newline> When the typing party has
finished, he/she types two newlines to signal that he/she is done; this
leaves a blank line between 'speeches' in the conversation, making it easier
to reread the preceding text. YHTBT You Had To Be There. Used of a situation
which loses significant meaning in the telling, usually because it's
difficult to convey tone and timing. <name>: When three or more terminals are
linked, it is conventional for each typist to {prepend} his/her login name or
handle and a colon (or a hyphen) to each line to indicate who is typing (some
conferencing facilities do this automatically). The login name is often
shortened to a unique prefix (possibly a single letter) during a very long
conversation. /\/\/\ A giggle or chuckle. On a MUD, this usually means
'earthquake fault'. <g> grin <gd&r> grinning, ducking, and running BBL be
back later BRB be right back HHOJ ha ha only joking HHOK ha ha only kidding
HHOS {ha ha only serious} IMHO in my humble opinion (see {IMHO}) LOL laughing
out loud NHOH Never Heard of Him/Her (often used in {initgame}) ROTF rolling
on the floor ROTFL rolling on the floor laughing AFK away from keyboard b4
before CU l8tr see you later MORF male or female? TTFN ta-ta for now TTYL
talk to you later OIC oh, I see rehi hello again Most of these are not used
at universities or in the Unix world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some
currency there and IMHO is common; conversely, most of the people who know
these are unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, {NIL}, and {T}. The {MUD}
community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more
natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the `social' list
above; specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW,
WTF, TTFN, and WTH. The use of rehi is also common; in fact, mudders are fond
of re- compounds and will frequently rehug or rebonk (see {bonk/oif}) people.
The word re by itself is taken as `regreet'. In general, though, MUDders
express a preference for typing things out in full rather than using
abbreviations; this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures,
which tend to include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links. The
following uses specific to MUDs are reported: CU l8er see you later (mutant
of CU l8tr) FOAD fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT) OTT over the
top (excessive, uncalled for) ppl abbrev for "people" THX thanks (mutant of
TNX; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the Lucasian K)). UOK? are you
OK? Some {B1FF}isms (notably the variant spelling d00d) appear to be passing
into wider use among some subgroups of MUDders. One final note on talk mode
style: neophytes, when in talk mode, often seem to think they must produce
letter-perfect prose because they are typing rather than speaking. This is
not the best approach. It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner
pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling error and
backs up to fix it. It is usually best just to leave typographical errors
behind and plunge forward, unless severe confusion may result; in that case
it is often fastest just to type "xxx" and start over from before the
mistake. see also {hakspek}, {emoticon}.
