 :mu: /moo/ The correct answer to the classic trick question "Have you
stopped beating your wife yet?". Assuming that you have no wife or you have
never beaten your wife, the answer "yes" is wrong because it implies that you
used to beat your wife and then stopped, but "no" is worse because it
suggests that you have one and are still beating her. According to various
Discordians and Douglas Hofstadter (see the Bibliography in {Appendix C}),
the correct answer is usually "mu", a Japanese word alleged to mean "Your
question cannot be answered because it depends on incorrect assumptions".
Hackers tend to be sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many
have adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm. The word `mu' is actually from
Chinese, meaning `nothing'; it is used in mainstream Japanese in that sense,
but native speakers do not recognize the Discordian question-denying use. It
almost certainly derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the
following well-known Rinzei Zen teaching riddle: A monk asked Joshu, "Does a
dog have the Buddha nature?" Joshu retorted, "Mu!" see also {has the X
nature}, {AI Koans}, and Douglas Hofstadter's `G"odel, Escher, Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid' (pointer in the Bibliography in appendix C).
