 :leaf site: n. [obs.] Before pervasive TCP/IP, this term was used of a
machine that merely originated and read Usenet news or mail, and did not
relay any third-party traffic. It was often uttered in a critical tone; when
the ratio of leaf sites to backbone, rib, and other relay sites got too high,
the network tended to develop bottlenecks. Compare {backbone site}, {rib
site}. Now that traffic patterns depend more on the distribution of routers
than of host machines this term has largely fallen out of use.
