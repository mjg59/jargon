 :leaf site: /n./ A machine that merely originates and reads Usenet news or
mail, and does not relay any third-party traffic. Often uttered in a critical
tone; when the ratio of leaf sites to backbone, rib, and other relay sites
gets too high, the network tends to develop bottlenecks. Compare {backbone
site}, {rib site}.
