 CP/M (see-pee-em) [Control Program for Microcomputers] An early
microcomputer OS written by hacker Gary Kildall for 8080 and Z-80 based
machines, very popular in the late 1970s until virtually wiped out by MS-DOS
after the release of the IBM PC in 1981 (legend has it that Kildall's company
blew their chance to write the PC's OS because Kildall decided to spend the
day IBM's reps wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in
his private plane). Many of its features and conventions strongly resemble
those of early DEC operating systems such as OS-8, RSTS and RSX-11. see
MS-DOS, OPERATING SYSTEM. CPU WARS n. A 1979 large-format comic by Chas
Andres chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of "IPM"
(Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the peaceful denizens
of HEC (Human Engineered Computers). This rather transparent allegory
featured many references to ADVENT (q.v.) and the immortal line "Eat flaming
death, minicomputer mongrels!" (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).
It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of appreciation
on IBM company stationery from the then-head of IBM's Thomas J. Watson
research laboratories (then as now one of the few islands of true hackerdom
in the IBM archipelago). The lower loop of the `B' in the IBM logo, it is
said, had been carefully whited out. see EAT FLAMING DEATH, X!.
