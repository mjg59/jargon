 :CPU Wars: /C-P-U worz/ /n./ A 1979 large-format comic by Chas Andres
chronicling the attempts of the brainwashed androids of IPM (Impossible to
Program Machines) to conquer and destroy the peaceful denizens of HEC (Human
Engineered Computers). This rather transparent allegory featured many
references to {ADVENT} and the immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer
mongrels!" (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper). It is alleged that
the author subsequently received a letter of appreciation on IBM company
stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratories
(then, as now, one of the few islands of true hackerdom in the IBM
archipelago). The lower loop of the B in the IBM logo, it is said, had been
carefully whited out. see {eat flaming death}.
