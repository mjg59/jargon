 :spamhaus: spam'hows n. Pejorative term for an internet service provider
that permits or even encourages {spam} mailings from its systems. The plural
is `spamhausen'. There is a web page devoted to tracking spamhausen
(http://www.spamhaus.org/). The most notorious of the spamhausen was Sanford
Wallace's Cyber Promotions Inc., shut down by a lawsuit on 16 October 1997.
The anniversary of the shutdown is celebrated on Usenet as Spam Freedom Day,
but lesser imitators of the Spamford still infest various murky corners of
the net. Since prosecution of spammers became routine under the junk-fax laws
and statues specifically targeting spam, spamhausen have declined in relative
importance; today, hit-and-run attacks by spammers using {relay rape} and
{throwaway account}s on reputable ISPs seem to account for most of the flow.
