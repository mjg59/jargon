 :pseudo: /soo'doh/ [USENET: truncation of `pseudonym'] n. 1. An
electronic-mail or {USENET} persona adopted by a human for amusement value or
as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of one's net.behavior; a `nom
de USENET', often associated with forged postings designed to conceal message
origins. Perhaps the best-known and funniest hoax of this type is {BIFF}. 2.
Notionally, a {flamage}-generating AI program simulating a USENET user. Many
flamers have been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact
that no AI program of the required sophistication yet exists. However, in
1989 there was a famous series of forged postings that used a
phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of several
well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their back postings
(compare {Dissociated Press}). A significant number of people were fooled by
the forgeries, and the debate over their authenticity was settled only when
the perpetrator came forward to publicly admit the hoax.
