 PSEUDO /soo'do/ [USENET] n. 1. An electronic-mail or USENET persona adopted
by a human for amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative
repercussions of his/her net.behavior; a `nom de USENET', often associated
with forged postings designed to conceal message origins. Perhaps the
best-known and funniest hoax of this type is BIFF (q.v.). 2. Notionally, a
FLAMAGE-generating AI program simulating a USENET user. Many FLAMERS have
been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI
program of the required sophistication exists. However, in 1989 there was a
famous series of forged postings that used a phrase-frequency-based travesty
generator to simulate the styles of several well-known flamers based on large
samples of their back postings. A significant number of people were fooled by
these, and the debate over their authenticity was only settled when the
perpetrator of the hoax came publicly forward to admit the deed.
