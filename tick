 TICK n. 1. The width of one tick of the system clock on the computer. Often
1 AC cycle time (1/60 second in the U.S. and 1/50 elsewhere) but more
recently 1/100 sec has become common. Syn JIFFY. 2. In simulations, the
discrete unit of time that passes "between" iterations of the simulation
mechanism. In AI applications, this amount of time is often left unspecified,
since the only constraint of interest is that caused things happen after
their causes. This sort of AI simulation is often pejoratively referred to as
"tick-tick-tick" simulation, especially when the issue of simultaneity of
events with long, independent chains of causes is handwaved.
