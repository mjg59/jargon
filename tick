 :tick: n. 1. A {jiffy} (sense 1). 2. In simulations, the discrete unit of
time that passes between iterations of the simulation mechanism. In AI
applications, this amount of time is often left unspecified, since the only
constraint of interest is the ordering of events. This sort of AI simulation
is often pejoratively referred to as tick-tick-tick simulation, especially
when the issue of simultaneity of events with long, independent chains of
causes is {handwave}d. 3. In the FORTH language, a single quote character.
