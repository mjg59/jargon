 TICK n. 1. Interval of time; basic clock time on the com- puter. Typically
1/60 second. see JIFFY. 2. In simu- lations, the discrete unit of time that
passes "between" iterations of the simulation mechanism. In AI applica-
tions, this amount of time is often left unspecified, since the only
constraint of interest is that caused things happen after their causes. This
sort of AI simu- lation is often pejoratively referred to as "tick-tick-
tick" simulation, especially when the issue of simul- taneity of events with
long, independent chains of causes is handwaved.
