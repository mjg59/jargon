 TICK n. 1. Interval of time; basic clock time on the computer. Typically
1/60 second. see JIFFY. 2. In simulations, the discrete unit of time that
passes "between" iterations of the simulation mechanism. In AI applications,
this amount of time is often left unspecified, since the only constraint of
interest is that caused things happen after their causes. This sort of AI
simulation is often pejoratively referred to as "tick-tick-tick" simulation,
especially when the issue of simultaneity of events with long, independent
chains of causes is handwaved.
