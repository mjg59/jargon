 :MIPS: /mips/ /n./ [abbreviation] 1. A measure of computing speed; formally,
`Million Instructions Per Second' (that's 10^6 per second, not 2^(20)!);
often rendered by hackers as `Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed' or
in other unflattering ways. This joke expresses a nearly universal attitude
about the value of most {benchmark} claims, said attitude being one of the
great cultural divides between hackers and {marketroid}s. The singular is
sometimes `1 MIP' even though this is clearly etymologically wrong. see also
{KIPS} and {GIPS}. 2. Computers, especially large computers, considered
abstractly as sources of {computron}s. "This is just a workstation; the heavy
MIPS are hidden in the basement." 3. The corporate name of a particular
RISC-chip company; among other things, they designed the processor chips used
in DEC's 3100 workstation series. 4. Acronym for `Meaningless Information per
Second' (a joke, prob. from sense 1).
