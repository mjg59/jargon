 MIPS (mips) [acronym] Formally, "Millions of Instructions Per Second"; often
rendered by hackers as "Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed". This joke
expresses a nearly universal attitude about the value of BENCHMARK (q.v.)
claims, said attitude being one of the great cultural divides between hackers
and MARKETROIDS.
