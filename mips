 :MIPS: /mips/, n. [abbreviation] 1. A measure of computing speed; formally,
`Million Instructions Per Second' (that's 10^6 per second, not 2^20!); often
rendered by hackers as `Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed' or in
other unflattering ways, such as `Meaningless Information Provided by
Salesmen'. This joke expresses an attitude nearly universal among hackers
about the value of most {benchmark} claims, said attitude being one of the
great cultural divides between hackers and {marketroid}s (see also
{BogoMIPS}). The singular is sometimes `1 MIP' even though this is clearly
etymologically wrong. see also {KIPS} and {GIPS}. 2. Computers, especially
large computers, considered abstractly as sources of {computron}s. "This is
just a workstation; the heavy MIPS are hidden in the basement." 3. The
corporate name of a particular RISC-chip company, later acquired by SGI. 4.
Acronym for `Meaningless Information per Second' (a joke, prob.: from sense
1).
