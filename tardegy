 :tardegy: tarÂ´djee, n. [deliberate mangling of tragedy] An incident in which
someone who clearly deserves to be selected out of the gene pool on grounds
of extreme stupidity meets with a messy end. Coined on the Darwin list, which
is dedicated to chronicling such incidents; but almost all hackers would
instantly recognize the intention of the term and laugh.
