 :chase pointers: 1. vi. To go through multiple levels of indirection, as in
traversing a linked list or graph structure. Used esp. by programmers in C,
where explicit pointers are a very common data type. This is techspeak, but
it remains jargon when used of human networks. "I'm chasing pointers. Bob
said you could tell me who to talk to about...." see {dangling pointer} and
{snap}. 2. [Cambridge] `pointer chase' or `pointer hunt': The process of
going through a dump (interactively or on a large piece of paper printed with
hex {runes}) following dynamic data-structures. Used only in a debugging
context.
