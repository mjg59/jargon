 CHASE POINTERS 1. vi. To go through multiple levels of indirection, as in
traversing a linked list or graph structure. Used esp. by programmers in C,
where explicit pointers are a very common data type. This is almost jargon in
the strict sense, but remains slang when used of human networks. "I'm chasing
pointers. Bob said you could tell me who to talk to about..." 2. [Cambridge]
POINTER CHASE or POINTER HUNT: the process of going through a dump
(intractively or on a large piece of paper printed with hex RUNES) following
dynamic data-structures. Only used in a debugging context.
