 CONWAY'S LAW n. The rule that the organization of the software and the
organization of the software team will be congruent; originally stated as "If
you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a four-pass compiler."
This was originally promulgated by Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE. "SAVE" didn't stand for
anything, it was just that you lost fewer decks and listings because they all
had SAVE written on top of them.
