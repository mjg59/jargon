 :Conway's Law: /prov./ The rule that the organization of the software and
the organization of the software team will be congruent; originally stated as
"If you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass
compiler". The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE. (The name `SAVE' didn't
stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer card decks and listings
because they all had SAVE written on them.) There is also Tom Cheatham's
amendment of Conway's Law: "If a group of N persons implements a COBOL
compiler, there will be N-1 passes. Someone in the group has to be the
manager."
