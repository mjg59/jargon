 :Conway's Law: prov. The rule that the organization of the software and the
organization of the software team will be congruent; commonly stated as "If
you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".
The original statement was more general, "Organizations which design systems
are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication
structures of these organizations." This first appeared in the April 1968
issue of {Datamation}. Compare {SNAFU principle}. The law was named after
Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who wrote an assembler for the Burroughs
220 called SAVE. (The name `SAVE' didn't stand for anything; it was just that
you lost fewer card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on
them.) There is also Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law: "If a group of
N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be N-1 passes. Someone in
the group has to be the manager."
