 :Conway's Law: prov. The rule that the organization of the software and the
organization of the software team will be congruent; originally stated as "If
you have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler".
This was originally promulgated by Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE. The name `SAVE' didn't
stand for anything; it was just that you lost fewer card decks and listings
because they all had SAVE written on them.
