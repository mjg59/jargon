 :cracking: n. [very common] The act of breaking into a computer system; what
a {cracker} does. Contrary to widespread myth, this does not usually involve
some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance, but rather persistence and the
dogged repetition of a handful of fairly well-known tricks that exploit
common weaknesses in the security of target systems. Accordingly, most
crackers are incompetent as hackers. This entry used to say 'mediocre', but
the spread of {rootkit} and other automated cracking has depressed the
average level of skill among crackers.
