 :cracking: n. The act of breaking into a computer system; what a {cracker}
does. Contrary to widespread myth, this does not usually involve some
mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance, but rather persistence and the dogged
repetition of a handful of fairly well-known tricks that exploit common
weaknesses in the security of target systems. Accordingly, most crackers are
only mediocre hackers.
