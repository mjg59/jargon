 :chrome: [from automotive slang via wargaming] n. Showy features added to
attract users but contributing little or nothing to the power of a system.
"The 3D icons in Motif are just chrome, but they certainly are *pretty*
chrome!" Distinguished from {bells and whistles} by the fact that the latter
are usually added to gratify developers' own desires for featurefulness.
Often used as a term of contempt.
