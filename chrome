 CHROME [from automotive slang via wargaming] n. Showy features added to
attract users, but which contribute little or nothing to the power of a
system. "The 3D icons in Motif are just chrome!" Distinguished from BELLS AND
WHISTLES by the fact that the latter are usually added to gratify developers'
own desires for featurefulness.
