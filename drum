 :drum: n. Ancient techspeak term referring to slow, cylindrical magnetic
media that were once state-of-the-art storage devices. Under some versions of
BSD Unix the disk partition used for swapping is still called /dev/drum; this
has led to considerable humor and not a few straight-faced but utterly bogus
`explanations' getting foisted on {newbie}s. see also " The Story of Mel'" in
Appendix A.
