 :drum: adj, n. Ancient techspeak term referring to slow, cylindrical
magnetic media that were once state-of-the-art storage devices. Under BSD
UNIX the disk partition used for swapping is still called `/dev/drum'; this
has led to considerable humor and not a few straight-faced but utterly bogus
`explanations' getting foisted on {newbie}s. see also "{The Story of Mel, a
Real Programmer}" in {Appendix A}.
