 :casting the runes: n. What a {guru} does when you ask him or her to run a
particular program and type at it because it never works for anyone else;
esp. used when nobody can ever see what the guru is doing different from what
J. Random Luser does. Compare {incantation}, {runes}, {examining the
entrails}; also see the AI koan about Tom Knight in "{A Selection of AI
Koans}" ({Appendix A}).
