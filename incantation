 INCANTATION (in-kan-tay'shn) n. Any particularly arbitrary or obscure
command that must be muttered at a system to attain a desired result. Not
used of passwords or other explicit security features. Especially used of
tricks that are so poorly documented they must be learned from a WIZARD. E.g.
"This compiler normally locates initialized data in the data segment, but if
you mutter the right incantation they will be forced into text space". see
MUTTER.
