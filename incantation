 :incantation: n. Any particularly arbitrary or obscure command that one must
mutter at a system to attain a desired result. Not used of passwords or other
explicit security features. Especially used of tricks that are so poorly
documented that they must be learned from a {wizard}. "This compiler normally
locates initialized data in the data segment, but if you {mutter} the right
incantation they will be forced into text space."
