 :AIDX: n. /aydkz/ n. Derogatory term for IBM's perverted version of UNIX,
AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM RS/6000 series. A victim of
the dreaded "hybridism" disease, this attempt to combine the two main
currents of the UNIX stream ({BSD} and {USG UNIX}) became a {monstrosity} to
haunt system administrators' dreams. For example, if new accounts are created
while many users are logged on, the load average jumps quickly over 20 due to
silly implementation of the user databases. For a quite similar disease,
compare {HP-SUX}. Also, compare {terminak}, {Macintrash} {Nominal
Semidestructor}, {Open DeathTrap}, {ScumOS}, {sun-stools}.
