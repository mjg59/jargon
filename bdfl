 :BDFL: [Python; common] Benevolent Dictator For Life. {Guido}, considered in
his role as the project leader of {Python}. People who are feeling
temporarily cheesed off by one of his decisions sometimes leave off the B.
The mental image that goes with this, of a cigar-chomping caudillo in gold
braid and sunglasses, is extremely funny to anyone who has ever met Guido in
person.
