 :UNIX:: /yoo'niks/ [In the authors' words, "A weak pun on Multics"] n. (also
`Unix') An interactive time-sharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson
after Bell Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play games
on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a
co-author of the system. The turning point in UNIX's history came when it was
reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972--1974, making it the first
source-portable OS. UNIX subsequently underwent mutations and expansions at
the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely flexible and
developer-friendly environment. By 1991, UNIX had become the most widely used
multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world. Many people consider
this the most important victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition
(but see {UNIX weenie} and {UNIX conspiracy} for an opposing point of view).
