 UNIX weenie: [ITS] n. 1. A derogatory play on `UNIX wizard', common among
hackers who use UNIX by necessity but would prefer alternatives. The
implication is that although the person in question may consider mastery of
UNIX arcana to be a wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the
ability to tolerate (and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and
needless complexity that is alleged to infest many UNIX programs. "This shell
script tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have been
written by a real UNIX weenie." 2. A derogatory term for anyone who engages
in uncritical praise of UNIX. Often appearing in the context "stupid UNIX
weenie". see {Weenix}, {UNIX conspiracy}. see also {weenie}. unixism: n. A
piece of code or a coding technique that depends on the protected
multi-tasking environment with relatively low process-spawn overhead that
exists on virtual-memory UNIX systems. Common {unixism}s include: gratuitous
use of `fork(2)'; the assumption that certain undocumented but well-known
features of UNIX libraries such as `stdio(3)' are supported elsewhere;
reliance on {obscure} side-effects of system calls (use of `sleep(2)' with a
0 argument to clue the scheduler that you're willing to give up your
time-slice, for example); the assumption that freshly allocated memory is
zeroed; and the assumption that fragmentation problems won't arise from never
`free()'ing memory. Compare {vaxocentrism}; see also {New Jersey}. unswizzle:
v. see {swizzle}. unwind the stack: vi. 1. [techspeak] During the execution
of a procedural language, one is said to `unwind the stack' from a called
procedure up to a caller when one discards the stack frame and any number of
frames above it, popping back up to the level of the given caller. In C this
is done with `longjmp'/`setjmp', in LISP with `throw/catch'. see also {smash
the stack}. 2. People can unwind the stack as well, by quickly dealing with a
bunch of problems: "Oh heck, let's do lunch. Just a second while I unwind my
stack." unwind-protect: [MIT: from the name of a LISP operator] n. A task you
must remember to perform before you leave a place or finish a project. "I
have an unwind-protect to call my advisor." up: adj. 1. Working, in order.
"The down escalator is up." Oppose {down}. 2. `bring up': vt. To create a
working version and start it. "They brought up a down system." 3. `come up'
vi. To become ready for production use. upload: /uhp'lohd/ v. 1. [techspeak]
To transfer programs or data over a digital communications link from a
smaller or peripheral `client' system to a larger or central `host' one. A
transfer in the other direction is, of course, called a {download} (but see
the note about ground-to-space comm under that entry). 2. [speculatively] To
move the essential patterns and algorithms that make up one's mind from one's
brain into a computer. Only those who are convinced that such patterns and
algorithms capture the complete essence of the self view this prospect with
gusto. upthread: adv. Earlier in the discussion (see {thread}), i.e.,
`above'. "As Joe pointed out upthread, ..." see also {followup}. urchin: n.
see {munchkin}.
