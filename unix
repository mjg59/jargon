 :Unix:: /yoo'niks/ n. [In the authors' words, "A weak pun on Multics"; very
early on it was `UNICS'] (also `UNIX') An interactive time-sharing system
invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project,
originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritchie, the
inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The turning point in
Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C during
1972--1974, making it the first source-portable OS. Unix subsequently
underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of many different people,
resulting in a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly environment. By 1991,
Unix had become the most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating
system in the world. Many people consider this the most important victory yet
of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see {Unix weenie} and {Unix
conspiracy} for an opposing point of view). see {Version 7}, {BSD}, {USG
Unix}, {Linux}. Some people are confused over whether this word is
appropriately `UNIX' or `Unix'; both forms are common, and used
interchangeably. Dennis Ritchie says that the `UNIX' spelling originally
happened in CACM's 1973 paper because "we had a new typesetter and troff had
just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small
caps." Later, dmr tried to get the spelling changed to `Unix' in a couple of
Bell Labs papers, on the grounds that the word is not acronymic. He failed,
and eventually (his words) "wimped out" on the issue. So both capitalizations
are grounded in ancient usage.
