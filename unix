 UNIX weenie: [ITS] n. 1. A derogatory play on `UNIX wizard', common among
hackers who use UNIX by necessity but would prefer alternatives. The
implication is that while the person in question may consider mastery of UNIX
arcana to be a wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the ability to
tolerate (and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and needless
complexity that is alleged to infest many UNIX programs. "This shell script
tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have been
written by a real UNIX weenie." 2. A derogatory term for anyone who engages
in uncritical praise of UNIX. Often appearing in the context "stupid UNIX
weenie". see {Weenix}, {UNIX conspiracy}. see also {weenie}. unixism: n. A
piece of code or coding technique that depends on the protected multi-tasking
environment with relatively low process-spawn overhead that exists on
virtual-memory UNIX systems. Common {unixism}s include: gratuitous use of
`fork(2)'; the assumption that certain undocumented but well-known features
of UNIX libraries like `stdio(3)' are supported elsewhere; reliance on
{obscure} side-effects of system calls (use of `sleep(2)' with a zero
argument to clue the scheduler that you're willing to give up your
time-slice, for example); the assumption that freshly allocated memory is
zeroed; the assumption that fragmentation problems won't arise from never
free()ing memory memory; etc. Compare {vaxocentrism}; see {New Jersey}.
unwind the stack: vi. 1. During the execution of a procedural language one is
said to `unwind the stack' from a called procedure up to a caller when one
discards the stack frame and any number of frames above it, popping back up
to the level of the given caller. In C this is done with longjmp/setjmp, in
LISP with THROW/CATCH. see also {smash the stack}. 2. People can unwind the
stack as well, by quickly dealing with a bunch of problems: "Oh heck, let's
do lunch. Just a second while I unwind my stack." unwind-protect: [MIT, from
the name of a LISP operator] n. A task you must remember to perform before
you leave a place or finish a project. "I have an unwind-protect to call my
advisor." up: adj. 1. Working, in order. "The down escalator is up." Oppose
{down}. 2. `bring up': vt. To create a working version and start it. "They
brought up a down system." upload: /uhp'lohd/ v. 1. To transfer programs or
data over a digital communications link from a smaller or peripheral `client'
system to a larger or central `host' one. A transfer in the other direction
is, of course, called a `download'. 2. [speculatively] To move the essential
patterns and algorithms which make up one's mind from one's brain into a
computer. Only those who are convinced that such patterns and algorithms
capture the complete essence of the self view this prospect with gusto.
upthread: adv. Earlier in the discussion (see {thread}), i.e. `above'. "As
Joe pointed out upthread...." see also {followup}. urchin: n. see {munchkin}.
