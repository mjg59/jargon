 :Unix: /yooÂ´niks/, n. [In the authors' words, "A weak pun on Multics"; very
early on it was "UNICS"] (also "UNIX") An interactive timesharing system
invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics project,
originally so he could play games on his scavenged PDP-7. Dennis Ritchie, the
inventor of C, is considered a co-author of the system. The turning point in
Unix's history came when it was reimplemented almost entirely in C during
1972--1974, making it the first source-portable OS. Unix subsequently
underwent mutations and expansions at the hands of many different people,
resulting in a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly environment. By 1991,
Unix had become the most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating
system in the world -- and since 1996 the variant called {Linux} has been at
the cutting edge of the {open source} movement. Many people consider the
success of Unix the most important victory yet of hackerdom over industry
opposition (but see {Unix weenie} and {Unix conspiracy} for an opposing point
of view). see {Version 7}, {BSD}, {Linux}. [richiethompson.jpg] Archetypal
hackers ken (left) and dmr (right). Some people are confused over whether
this word is appropriately `UNIX' or `Unix'; both forms are common, and used
interchangeably. Dennis Ritchie says that the `UNIX' spelling originally
happened in CACM's 1974 paper The UNIX Time-Sharing System because "we had a
new typesetter and {troff} had just been invented and we were intoxicated by
being able to produce small caps." Later, dmr tried to get the spelling
changed to `Unix' in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on the grounds that the
word is not acronymic. He failed, and eventually (his words) "wimped out" on
the issue. So, while the trademark today is `UNIX', both capitalizations are
grounded in ancient usage; the Jargon File uses `Unix' in deference to dmr's
wishes.
