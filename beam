 :beam: vt. [from Star Trek Classic's "Beam me up, Scotty!"] 1. To transfer
{softcopy} of a file electronically; most often in combining forms such as
`beam me a copy' or `beam that over to his site'. 2. Palm Pilot users very
commonly use this term for the act of exchanging bits via the infrared links
on their machines (this term seems to have originated with the ill-fated
Newton Message Pad). Compare {blast}, {snarf}, {BLT}.
