 :hack mode: n. 1. What one is in when hacking, of course. 2. More
specifically, a Zen-like state of total focus on The Problem that may be
achieved when one is hacking (this is why every good hacker is part mystic).
Ability to enter such concentration at will correlates strongly with
wizardliness; it is one of the most important skills learned during {larval
stage}. Sometimes amplified as `deep hack mode'. Being yanked out of hack
mode (see {priority interrupt}) may be experienced as a physical shock, and
the sensation of being in hack mode is more than a little habituating. The
intensity of this experience is probably by itself sufficient explanation for
the existence of hackers, and explains why many resist being promoted out of
positions where they can code. see also {cyberspace} (sense 3). Some aspects
of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer unaware of the high
value placed on hack mode. For example, if someone appears at your door, it
is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without turning one's eyes away from the
screen) to avoid being interrupted. One may read, type, and interact with the
computer for quite some time before further acknowledging the other's
presence (of course, he or she is reciprocally free to leave without a word).
The understanding is that you might be in {hack mode} with a lot of delicate
{state} (sense 2) in your head, and you dare not {swap} that context out
until you have reached a good point to pause. see also {juggling eggs}.
