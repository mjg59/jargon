 HACK MODE n. 1. What one is in when hacking, of course. 2. More
specifically, a Zen-like state of total focus on The Problem which may be
achieved when one is hacking. Ability to enter such concentration at will
correlates strongly with wizardliness; it is one of the most important skills
learned during LARVAL STAGE. Sometimes amplified as DEEP HACK MODE. Being
yanked out of hack mode (see PRIORITY INTERRUPT) may be experienced as an
almost physical shock, and the sensation of being in it is more than a little
habituating. The intensity of this experience is probably by itself
sufficient explanation for the existence of hackers, and explains why many
resist being promoted out of positions where they can do code.
