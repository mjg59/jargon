 :munge: /muhnj/ vt. 1. [derogatory] To imperfectly transform information. 2.
A comprehensive rewrite of a routine, data structure or the whole program. 3.
To modify data in some way the speaker doesn't need to go into right now or
cannot describe succinctly (compare {mumble}). This term is often confused
with {mung}, which probably was derived from it. However, it also appears the
word `munge' was in common use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in
the 1950s, as a verb, meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and as a
noun, meaning the result of munging something up (the parallel with the
{kluge}/{kludge} pair is amusing).
