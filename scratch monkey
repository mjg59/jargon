 :scratch monkey: n. As in "Before testing or reconfiguring, always mount a
{scratch monkey}", a proverb used to advise caution when dealing with
irreplaceable data or devices. Used to refer to any scratch volume hooked to
a computer during any risky operation as a replacement for some precious
resource or data that might otherwise get trashed. This term preserves the
memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey, star of a biological research
program at the University of Toronto ca. 1986. Mabel was not (so the legend
goes) your ordinary monkey; the university had spent years teaching her how
to swim, breathing through a regulator, in order to study the effects of
different gas mixtures on her physiology. Mabel suffered an untimely demise
one day when DEC {PM}ed the PDP-11 controlling her regulator (see also
{provocative maintenance}). It is recorded that, after calming down an
understandably irate customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the
matter, a DEC troubleshooter called up the {field circus} manager responsible
and asked him sweetly, "Can you swim?" Not all the consequences to humans
were so amusing; the sysop of the machine in question was nearly thrown in
jail at the behest of certain clueless droids at the local `humane' society.
The moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.
