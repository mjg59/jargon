 MACDINK (mak'dink) [from the Apple Macintosh, which is said to encourage
such behavior] v. To make many incremental and unnecessary cosmetic changes
to a program or file. Frequently the subject of the macdinking would be
better off without them. Ex: "When I left at 11pm last night, he was still
macdinking the slides for his presentation."
