 :dinosaurs mating: n. Said to occur when yet another {big iron} merger or
buyout occurs; reflects a perception by hackers that these signal another
stage in the long, slow dying of the {mainframe} industry. In its glory days
of the 1960s, it was `IBM and the Seven Dwarves': Burroughs, Control Data,
General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac. RCA and GE sold out early,
and it was `IBM and the Bunch' (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and
Honeywell) for a while. Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged
with Univac to form Unisys (in 1984 --- this was when the phrase `dinosaurs
mating' was coined); and as this is written (early 1991) AT&T is attempting
to recover from a disastrously bad first six years in the hardware industry
by absorbing NCR. More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem
inevitable.
