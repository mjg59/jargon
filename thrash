 THRASH v. To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything
useful. Paging or swapping systems which are overloaded waste most of their
time moving data into and out of core (rather than performing useful
computation), and are therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps changing
his mind is said to be thrashing.
