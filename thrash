 :thrash: /vi./ To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything
useful. Paging or swapping systems that are overloaded waste most of their
time moving data into and out of core (rather than performing useful
computation) and are therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps changing his
mind (esp. about what to work on next) is said to be thrashing. A person
frantically trying to execute too many tasks at once (and not spending enough
time on any single task) may also be described as thrashing. Compare
{multitask}.
