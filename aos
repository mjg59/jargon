 JARGON.TXT recovered from Fall 1981 RSX-11 SIG tape by Tim Shoppa,
<shoppa@trailing-edge.com>: Notes on updating this file: This glossary file
is being maintained at two main locations. It is AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] at SAIL,
and GLS;JARGON > at MIT. If you make any changes, be sure to FTP the new file
to the other location. (NOTE: Use ASCII mode in FTP to avoid screwing up the
tilde char!) Also, please let us know (see list of names in later paragraph)
about your changes so that we can double-check them. Try to conform to the
format already being used--70 character lines, 3-character indentations,
pronunciations in parentheses, etymologies in brackets, single-space after
def'n numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the standard ASCII character
set. If you'd rather not mung the file yourself, send your definitions to DON
@ SAIL, GLS @ MIT-AI, and/or MRC @ SAIL.

Compiled by Guy L. Steele Jr., Raphael Finkel, Donald Woods, and Mark
Crispin, with assistance from the MIT and Stanford AI communities and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Some contributions were submitted via the
ARPAnet from miscellaneous sites. Verb doubling: a standard construction is
to double a verb and use it as a comment on what the implied subject does.
Often used to terminate a conversation. Typical examples involve WIN, LOSE,
HACK, FLAME, BARF, CHOMP: "The disk heads just crashed." "Lose, lose."
"Mostly he just talked about his --- crock. Flame, flame." "Boy, what a
bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!" Soundalike slang: similar to Cockney rhyming slang.
Often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples: Boston Globe =>
Boston Glob Herald American => Horrid (Harried) American New York Times =>
New York Slime Dime Time => Slime Time government property - do not duplicate
(seen on keys) => government duplicity - do not propagate Often the
substitution will be made in such a way as to slip in a standard jargon word:
Dr. Dobb's Journal => Dr. Frob's Journal The -P convention: turning a word
into a question by appending the syllable "P"; from the LISP convention of
appending the letter "P" to denote a predicate (a Boolean-values function).
The question should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't. (see T and
NIL.) At dinnertime: "Foodp?" "Yeah, I'm pretty hungry." or "T!"
"State-of-the-world-P?" (Straight) "I'm about to go home." (Humorous) "Yes,
the world has a state." Peculiar nouns: MIT AI hackers love to take various
words and add the wrong endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by
extending a standard rule to nonuniform cases. Examples: porous => porosity
generous => generosity Ergo: mysterious => mysteriosity ferrous => ferocity
Other examples: winnitude, disgustitude, hackification. AOS (aus (East coast)
ay-ahs (West coast)) [based on a PDP-10 increment instruction] v. To increase
the amount of something. "Aos the campfire." Usage: considered silly. see
SOS.
