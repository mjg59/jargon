 AOS: 1. /aws/ (East coast), /ay-os/ (West coast) [based on a PDP-10
increment instruction] vt.,obs. To increase the amount of something. "Aos the
campfire." Usage: considered silly, and now obsolete. see {SOS}. Now largely
supplanted by {bump}. 2. A crufty {Multics}-derived OS supported at one time
by Data General. This was pronounced /ay-oh-ess/ or /ay-os/, the latter being
prevalent internally at DG. A spoof of the standard AOS system
administrator's manual (`How to load and generate your AOS system') was
created, issued a part number, and allegedly released. It was called `How to
goad and levitate your chaos system'. Historical note: AOS in sense #1 was
the name of a {PDP-10} instruction that took any memory location in the
computer and added one to it; AOS meant `Add One and do not Skip'. Why, you
may ask, does the `S' stand for `do not Skip' rather than for `Skip'? Ah,
here was a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore. There were eight such
instructions: AOSE added one and then skipped the next instruction if the
result was Equal to zero; AOSG added one and then skipped if the result was
Greater than zero; AOSN added one and then skipped if the result was Not
zero; AOSA added one and then skipped Always; and so on. Just plain AOS
didn't say when to skip, so it never skipped. For similar reasons, AOJ meant
`Add One and do not Jump'. Even more bizarre, SKIP meant `Do not SKIP'! If
you wanted to skip the next instruction, you had to say `SKIPA'. Likewise,
JUMP means `Do not JUMP'. Such were the perverse mysteries of assembler
programming. app: /ap/ n. Short for `application program', as opposed to a
systems program. What systems vendors are forever chasing developers to do
for their environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to think
of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term
excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
user would consider all those apps. Oppose {tool}, {operating system}. arc:
[primarily MSDOS] vt. To create a compressed archive from a group of files
using the SEA ARC, PKWare PKARC, or compatible program. Rapidly becoming
obsolete as the ARC compression method is falling into disuse, having been
replaced by newer compression techniques. see {tar and feather}, {zip}. arc
wars: [primarily MSDOS] n. {holy wars} over which archiving program one
should use. The first arc war was sparked when System Enhancement Associates
(SEA) sued PKWare for copyright and trademark infringement on its ARC
program. PKWare's PKARC outperformed ARC on both compression and speed while
largely retaining compatibility (it introduced a new compression type which
could be disabled for backward-compatibility). PKWare settled out of court to
avoid enormous legal costs (both SEA and PKWare are small companies); as part
of the settlement, the name of PKARC was changed to PKPAK. The public
backlash against SEA for bringing suit helped to hasten the demise of ARC as
a standard when PKWare and others introduced new, incompatible archivers with
better compression algorithms. arena: [UNIX] n. The area of memory attached
to a process by `brk(2)' and `sbrk(2)' and used by `malloc(3)' as dynamic
storage. So named from a semi-mythical `malloc: corrupt arena' message
supposedly emitted when some early versions became terminally confused. see
{overrun screw}, {aliasing bug}, {memory leak}, {smash the stack}. arg: /arg/
n. Abbreviation for `argument' (to a function), used so often as to have
become a new word (like `piano' from `pianoforte'). "The sine function takes
one arg, but the arc-tangent function can take either one or two args".
Compare {param}, {parm}, {var}. armor-plated: n. Syn. for {bulletproof}.
asbestos: adj. Used as a modifier to anything intended to protect one from
{flame}s. Important cases of this include {asbestos longjohns} and {asbestos
cork award}, but it is used more generally. asbestos cork award: n. Once,
long ago at MIT, there was a {flamer} so consistently obnoxious that another
hacker designed, had made, and distributed posters announcing that said
flamer had been nominated for the `asbestos cork award'. Persons in any doubt
as to the intended application of the cork should consult the etymology under
{flame}. Since then, it is agreed that only a select few have risen to the
heights of bombast required to earn this dubious dignity --- but there's no
agreement on *which* few. asbestos longjohns: n. Notional garments often
donned by {USENET} posters just before emitting a remark they expect will
elicit {flamage}. Also `asbestos underwear', `asbestos overcoat', etc.
