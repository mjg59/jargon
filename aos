 APPENDIX A: THE UNTIMELY DEMISE OF MABEL THE MONKEY a cautionary tale The
following, modulo a couple of inserted commas and capitalization changes for
readability, is the exact text of a famous USENET message. The reader may
wish to review the definitions of PM and MOUNT in the main text before
continuing. ~Date: Wed 3 Sep 86 16:46:31-EDT ~From: "Art Evans"

Risks@CSL.SRI.COM My friend Bud used to be the intercept man at a computer
vendor for calls when an irate customer called. seems one day Bud was sitting
at his desk when the phone rang. Bud: Hello. Voice: YOU KILLED MABEL!! B:
Excuse me? V: YOU KILLED MABEL!! This went on for a couple of minutes and Bud
was getting nowhere, so he decided to alter his approach to the customer. B:
HOW DID I KILL MABEL? V: YOU PM'ED MY MACHINE!! Well, to avoid making a long
story even longer, I will abbreviate what had happened. The customer was a
Biologist at the University of Blah-de-blah, and he had one of our computers
that controlled gas mixtures that Mabel (the monkey) breathed. Now, Mabel was
not your ordinary monkey. The University had spent years teaching Mabel to
swim, and they were studying the effects that different gas mixtures had on
her physiology. It turns out that the repair folks had just gotten a new
Calibrated Power Supply (used to calibrate analog equipment), and at their
first opportunity decided to calibrate the D/A converters in that computer.
This changed some of the gas mixtures and poor Mabel was asphyxiated. Well,
Bud then called the branch manager for the repair folks: Manager: Hello B:
This is Bud, I heard you did a PM at the University of Blah-de-blah. M: Yes,
we really performed a complete PM. What can I do for you? B: Can you swim?
The moral is, of course, that you should always mount a scratch monkey.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ There are several morals here related to risks in use
of computers. Examples include, "If it ain't broken, don't fix it." However,
the cautious philosophical approach implied by "always mount a scratch
monkey" says a lot that we should keep in mind. Art Evans Tartan Labs
APPENDIX B: OBSOLESCENT TERMS FROM THE JARGON FILE The following terms
appeared in the main listing of the original Jargon File, but have been
rendered obsolescent by the passage of time, the march of technology, the
death of the DEC PDP-10, and the May 1990 shutdown of the ITS machines. They
are collected here for possible historical interest. AOS (aus (East coast)
ay-ahs (West coast)) [based on a PDP-10 increment instruction] v. To increase
the amount of something. "Aos the campfire." Usage: considered silly, and now
obsolescent. see SOS. Now largely supplanted by BUMP.
