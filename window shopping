 :window shopping: n. [US Geological Survey] Among users of {WIMP
environment}s like {X} or the Macintosh, extended experimentation with new
window colors, fonts, and icon shapes. This activity can take up hours of
what might otherwise have been productive working time. "I spent the
afternoon window shopping until I found the coolest shade of green for my
active window borders -- now they perfectly match my medium slate blue
background." Serious window shoppers will spend their days with bitmap
editors, creating new and different icons and background patterns for all to
see. Also: `window dressing', the act of applying new fonts, colors, etc. see
