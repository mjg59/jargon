 :content-free: [by analogy with techspeak `context-free'] adj. Used of a
message that adds nothing to the recipient's knowledge. Though this adjective
is sometimes applied to {flamage}, it more usually connotes derision for
communication styles that exalt form over substance or are centered on
concerns irrelevant to the subject ostensibly at hand. Perhaps most used with
reference to speeches by company presidents and other professional
manipulators. "Content-free? Uh...that's anything printed on glossy paper."
see also {four-color glossies}. "He gave a talk on the implications of
electronic networks for postmodernism and the fin-de-siecle aesthetic. It was
content-free."
