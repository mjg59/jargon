 CONTENT-FREE adj. Ironic analogy with "bug-free", used of a message which
adds nothing to the recipient's knowledge. Though this adjective is sometimes
applied to FLAMAGE, it more usually connotes derision for comunication styles
which exalt form over substance, or are centered on concerns irrelevant to
the subject ostensibly at hand. "Content-free? Uh...that's anything printed
on glossy paper".
