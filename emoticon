 EMOTICON /ee-moh'ti-cahn/ n. An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional
state in email or news. Hundreds have been proposed, but only a few are in
common use. These include: :-) Smiley face (indicates laughter) :-( Frowney
face (indicates sadness, anger or upset) ;-) Half-smiley (ha ha only
serious), aka winkey face. :-/ Wry face Of these, the first two are by far
the most frequently encountered. Hyphenless forms of them are common on
CompuServe, GEnie and BIX; see also BIXIE. On USENET, "smiley" is often used
as a generic (synonym for emoticon) as well as specifically for the
happy-face emoticon. Note for the NEWBIE: overuse of the smiley is a mark of
loserhood! More than one per paragraph is a sure sign that you've gone over
the line.
