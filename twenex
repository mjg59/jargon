 TWENEX /twe-neks/ n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC. TOPS-10 was a
typically crufty DEC operating system for the PDP-10, so TOPS-20 was the
obvious name choice for the DEC-20 OS. Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) had
developed their own system, called TENEX (TEN EXecutive), and in creating
TOPS-20 DEC copied TENEX and adapted it for the 20. The term TWENEX was
therefore a contraction of "twenty TENEX". DEC people cringed when they heard
TOPS-20 referred to as "Twenex", but the term caught on nevertheless. The
written abbreviation "20x" was also used. TWENEX was successful and very
popular; in fact, there was a period in the 1980s when it commanded almost as
fervent a culture of partisans as UNIX or ITS --- but DEC's decision to scrap
all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and the relatively stodgy VMS
OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun.
