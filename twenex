 TWENEX (twe'nex) n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC. So named because
TOPS-10 was a typically crufty DEC operating system for the PDP-10. BBN
developed their own system, called TENEX (TEN EXecutive), and in creating
TOPS-20 for the DEC-20 DEC copied TENEX and adapted it for the 20. Usage: DEC
people cringe when they hear TOPS-20 referred to as "Twenex", but the term
seems to be catching on nevertheless. Release 3 of TOPS-20 is sufficiently
different from release 1 that some (not all) hackers have stopped calling it
TWENEX, though the written abbreviation "20x" is still used.
