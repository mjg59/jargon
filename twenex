 TWENEX: /twe'neks/ n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC. TOPS-10 was a
typically crufty DEC operating system for the PDP-10, so TOPS-20 was the
obvious name for the DECSYSTEM-20 OS. Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) had
developed its own system, called *TENEX* (TEN EXecutive), and in creating
TOPS-20 DEC copied TENEX and adapted it for the '20. The term TWENEX was
therefore a contraction of `twenty TENEX'. DEC people cringed when they heard
TOPS-20 referred to as `TWENEX', but the term caught on nevertheless. The
written abbreviation `20x' was also used. TWENEX was successful and very
popular; in fact, there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as
fervent a culture of partisans as UNIX or ITS --- but DEC's decision to scrap
all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS
OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun.
twiddle: n. 1. Tilde (ASCII #b1111110, `~'). Also called `squiggle',
`sqiggle' (sic --- pronounced /skig'l/), and `twaddle', but twiddle is the
most common term. 2. A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually
fixes one bug and generates several new ones. 3. vt. To change something in a
small way. Bits, for example, are often twiddled. Twiddling a switch or knob
implies much less sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see
{frobnicate}. To speak of twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best
doesn't specify what you're doing to the bit; by contrast, toggling a bit has
a more specific meaning (see {bit twiddling}, {toggle}). twink: /twink/
[UCSC] n. Equivalent to {read-only user}. two pi: quant. The number of years
it takes to finish one's thesis. Occurs in stories in the form: "He started
on his thesis; two pi years later...". two-to-the-n: quant. An amount much
larger than {N}, but smaller than {infinity}. "I have two-to-the-N things to
do before I can go out for lunch." means you probably won't show up. twonkie:
n. The software equivalent of a Twinkie; a useless `feature' added to look
sexy and placate a {marketroid}. This may be related to the `The Twonky',
title menace of a classic SF short story by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner & C.
L. Moore), first published in the September 1942 `Astounding Science Fiction'
and subsequently much anthologized. = U = =====
