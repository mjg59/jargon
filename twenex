 TWENEX:: /twe'neks/ n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC --- the second
proprietary OS for the PDP-10 --- preferred by most PDP-10 hackers over
TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not {{ITS}} or {{WAITS}} partisans).
TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek & Newman's TENEX operating system
using special paging hardware. By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems
on the ARPANET ran TENEX. DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
began work to make it their own. The first in-house code name for the
operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when customers
started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC could
truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS. When the name SNARK
became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly
abandoned when it was discovered that `krans' meant `funeral shroud' in
Swedish. Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system,
and it was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed. The hacker community, mindful of
its origins, quickly dubbed it {{TWENEX}} (a contraction of `twenty TENEX'),
even though by this point very little of the original TENEX code remained
(analogously to the differences between AT&T V6 UNIX and BSD). DEC people
cringed when they heard "TWENEX", but the term caught on nevertheless (the
written abbreviation `20x' was also used). TWENEX was successful and very
popular; in fact, there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as
fervent a culture of partisans as UNIX or ITS --- but DEC's decision to scrap
all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its relatively stodgy VMS
OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's brief day in the sun. DEC
attempted to convince TOPS-20 hackers to convert to {VMS}, but instead, by
the late 1980s, most of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to UNIX. twiddle: n.
1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, `~'). Also called `squiggle', `sqiggle' (sic ---
pronounced /skig'l/), and `twaddle', but twiddle is the most common term. 2.
A small and insignificant change to a program. Usually fixes one bug and
generates several new ones. 3. vt. To change something in a small way. Bits,
for example, are often twiddled. Twiddling a switch or knob implies much less
sense of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see {frobnicate}. To speak of
twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't specify what you're
doing to the bit; `toggling a bit' has a more specific meaning (see {bit
twiddling}, {toggle}). twink: /twink/ [UCSC] n. Equivalent to {read-only
user}. Also reported on the USENET group soc.motss; may derive from gay slang
for a cute young thing with nothing upstairs. two pi: quant. The number of
years it takes to finish one's thesis. Occurs in stories in the following
form: "He started on his thesis; 2 pi years later..." two-to-the-N: quant. An
amount much larger than {N} but smaller than {infinity}. "I have 2-to-the-N
things to do before I can go out for lunch" means you probably won't show up.
twonkie: /twon'kee/ n. The software equivalent of a Twinkie (a variety of
sugar-loaded junk food, or (in gay slang) the male equivalent of `chick'); a
useless `feature' added to look sexy and placate a {marketroid} (compare
{Saturday-night special}). This may also be related to "The Twonky", title
menace of a classic SF short story by Lewis Padgett (Henry Kuttner and C. L.
Moore), first published in the September 1942 `Astounding Science Fiction'
and subsequently much anthologized. = U = =====
