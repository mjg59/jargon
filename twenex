 TWENEX n. The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC. So named because TOPS-10 was
a typically crufty DEC operating - 33 - system for the PDP-10. BBN developed
their own system, called TENEX (TEN EXecutive), and in creating TOPS-20 for
the DEC-20 DEC copied TENEX and adapted it for the 20. Usage: DEC people
cringe when they hear TOPS-20 referred to as "Twenex," but the term seems to
be catch- ing on nevertheless. Release 3 of TOPS-20 is suffi- ciently
different from release 1 that some (not all) hackers have stopped calling it
TWENEX, though the writ- ten abbreviation "20x" is still used.
