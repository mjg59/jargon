 :miswart: /mis-wort/ /n./ [from {wart} by analogy with {misbug}] A {feature}
that superficially appears to be a {wart} but has been determined to be the
{Right Thing}. For example, in some versions of the {EMACS} text editor, the
`transpose characters' command exchanges the character under the cursor with
the one before it on the screen, *except* when the cursor is at the end of a
line, in which case the two characters before the cursor are exchanged. While
this behavior is perhaps surprising, and certainly inconsistent, it has been
found through extensive experimentation to be what most users want. This
feature is a miswart.
