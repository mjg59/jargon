 :control-O: vi. "Stop talking." From the character used on some operating
systems to abort output but allow the program to keep on running. Generally
means that you are not interested in hearing anything more from that person,
at least on that topic; a standard response to someone who is flaming.
Considered silly. Compare {control-S}.
