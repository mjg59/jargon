 :Weenix: /wee'niks/ [ITS] n. A derogatory term for {{UNIX}}, derived from
{UNIX weenie}. According to one noted ex-ITSer, it is "the operating system
preferred by Unix Weenies: typified by poor modularity, poor reliability,
hard file deletion, no file version numbers, case sensitivity everywhere, and
users who believe that these are all advantages". Some ITS fans behave as
though they believe UNIX stole a future that rightfully belonged to them. see
{{ITS}}, sense 2.
