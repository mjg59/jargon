 GC: /jee-see/ [from LISP terminology; `Garbage Collect'] 1. vt. To clean up
and throw away useless things. "I think I'll GC the top of my desk today."
When said of files, this is equivalent to {GFR}. 2. vt. To recycle, reclaim,
or put to another use. 3. n. An instantiation of the garbage collector
process. `Garbage collection' is computer science jargon for a particular
class of strategies for dynamically reallocating computer memory. One such
strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in memory and
determining what is no longer useful; useless data items are then discarded
so that the memory they occupy can be recycled and used for another purpose.
Implementations of the LISP language usually use garbage collection. In
slang, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the acronym is more frequently
used because it's shorter. Note that there is an ambiguity in usage that has
to be resolved by context: "I'm going to garbage-collect my desk" usually
means to clean out the drawers, but it could also mean to throw away or
recycle the desk itself. Warning: in {X} programming, a `GC' may be a
graphics context. This technical term has nothing to do with the jargon {GC}!
