 :teledildonics: /tel`*-dil-do'-niks/ n. Sex in a computer simulated virtual
reality, esp. computer-mediated sexual interaction between the {VR} presences
of two humans. This practice is not yet possible except in the rather limited
form of erotic conversation on {MUD}s and the like. The term, however, is
widely recognized in the VR community as a {ha ha only serious} projection of
things to come. "When we can sustain a multi-sensory surround good enough for
teledildonics, *then* we'll know we're getting somewhere."
