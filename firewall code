 :firewall code: /n./ 1. The code you put in a system (say, a telephone
switch) to make sure that the users can't do any damage. Since users always
want to be able to do everything but never want to suffer for any mistakes,
the construction of a firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but
also of interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about
those corners of a system where they can burn themselves. 2. Any sanity check
inserted to catch a {can't happen} error. Wise programmers often change code
to fix a bug twice: once to fix the bug, and once to insert a firewall which
would have arrested the bug before it did quite as much damage.
