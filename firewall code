 :firewall code: n. The code you put in a system (say, a telephone switch) to
make sure that the users can't do any damage. Since users always want to be
able to do everything but never want to suffer for any mistakes, the
construction of a firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but
also of interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about
those corners of a system where they can burn themselves.
