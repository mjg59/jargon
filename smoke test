 :smoke test: n. 1. A rudimentary form of testing applied to electronic
equipment following repair or reconfiguration, in which power is applied and
the tester checks for sparks, smoke, or other dramatic signs of fundamental
failure. see {magic smoke}. 2. By extension, the first run of a piece of
software after construction or a critical change. see and compare {reality
check}. There is an interesting semi-parallel to this term among typographers
and printers: When new typefaces are being punch-cut by hand, a smoke test
(hold the letter in candle smoke, then press it onto paper) is used to check
out new dies.
