 :choke: v. 1. To reject input, often ungracefully. "NULs make System V's
`lpr(1)' choke." "I tried building an {EMACS} binary to use {X}, but `cpp(1)'
choked on all those `#define's." see {barf}, {gag}, {vi}. 2. [MIT] More
generally, to fail at any endeavor, but with some flair or bravado; the
popular definition is "to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory."
