 :voodoo programming: n. [from George Bush's "voodoo economics"] 1. The use
by guess or cookbook of an {obscure} or {hairy} system, feature, or algorithm
that one does not truly understand. The implication is that the technique may
not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why. Almost synonymous with
{black magic}, except that black magic typically isn't documented and nobody
understands it. Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy wizardry}, {rain
dance}, {cargo cult programming}, {wave a dead chicken}, {SCSI voodoo}. 2.
Things programmers do that they know shouldn't work but they try anyway, and
which sometimes actually work, such as recompiling everything.
