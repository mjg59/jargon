 :voodoo programming: n. [from George Bush's "voodoo economics"] The use by
guess or cookbook of an {obscure} or {hairy} system, feature, or algorithm
that one does not truly understand. The implication is that the technique may
not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why. Almost synonymous with
{black magic}, except that black magic typically isn't documented and
*nobody* understands it. Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy wizardry},
{rain dance}, {cargo cult programming}, {wave a dead chicken}.
