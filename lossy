 :lossy: adj. [Usenet] 1. Said of people, this indicates a poor memory,
usually short-term. This usage is analogical to the same term applied to data
compression and analysis. "He's very lossy." means that you can't rely on him
to accurately remember recent experiences or conversations, or requests. Not
to be confused with a `loser', which is a person who is in a continual state
of lossiness, as in sense 2 (see below). 2. Said of an attitude or a
situation, this indicates a general downturn in emotions, lack of success in
attempted endeavors, etc. Eg, "I'm having a lossy day today." means that the
speaker has `lost' or is `losing' in all of their activities, and that this
is causing some increase in negative emotions.
