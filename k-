 :k-: pref. Extremely. Not commonly used among hackers, but quite common
among crackers and {warez d00dz} in compounds such as `k-kool' /K'kool'/,
`k-rad' /K'rad'/, and `k-awesome' /K'aw`sm/. Also used to intensify
negatives; thus, `k-evil', `k-lame', `k-screwed', and `k-annoying'. Overuse
of this prefix, or use in more formal or technical contexts, is considered an
indicator of {lamer} status.
