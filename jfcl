 JFCL: /jif'kl/ or /jaf'kl/ vt., obs. (alt. `jfcl') To cancel or annul
something. "Why don't you jfcl that out?" The fastest do-nothing instruction
on older models of the PDP-10 happened to be JFCL, which stands for "Jump if
Flag set and then CLear the flag"; this does something useful, but is a very
fast no-operation if no flag is specified. Geoff Goodfellow, one of the
jargon-1 co-authors, has long had JFCL on the license plate of his BMW.
Usage: rare except among old-time PDP-10 hackers.
