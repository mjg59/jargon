 :JFCL: /jif'kl/, /jaf'kl/, /j*-fi'kl/ vt., obs. (alt. `jfcl') To cancel or
annul something. "Why don't you jfcl that out?" The fastest do-nothing
instruction on older models of the PDP-10 happened to be JFCL, which stands
for "Jump if Flag set and then CLear the flag"; this does something useful,
but is a very fast no-operation if no flag is specified. Geoff Goodfellow,
one of the Steele-1983 co-authors, had JFCL on the license plate of his BMW
for years. Usage: rare except among old-time PDP-10 hackers.
