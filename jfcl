 JFCL /jif'kl/ or /jaf'kl/ v., obs. To cancel or annul something. "Why don't
you jfcl that out?" The fastest do-nothing instruction on the PDP-10 happened
to be JFCL, which stands for "Jump if Flag set and then CLear the flag"; this
does something useful, but is a very fast no-operation if no flag is
specified. Geoff Goodfellow, one of the jargon-1 compilers, once had JFCL on
the license plate of his BMW.
