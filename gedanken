 :gedanken: /g*-don'kn/ adj. Ungrounded; impractical; not well-thought-out;
untried; untested. `Gedanken' is a German word for `thought'. A thought
experiment is one you carry out in your head. In physics, the term `gedanken
experiment' is used to refer to an experiment that is impractical to carry
out, but useful to consider because it can be reasoned about theoretically.
(A classic gedanken experiment of relativity theory involves thinking about a
man in an elevator accelerating through space.) Gedanken experiments are very
useful in physics, but must be used with care. It's too easy to idealize away
some important aspect of the real world in contructing the `apparatus'. Among
hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation. It is typically
used of a project, especially one in artificial intelligence research, that
is written up in grand detail (typically as a Ph.D. thesis) without ever
being implemented to any great extent. Such a project is usually perpetrated
by people who aren't very good hackers or find programming distasteful or are
just in a hurry. A `gedanken thesis' is usually marked by an obvious lack of
intuition about what is programmable and what is not, and about what does and
does not constitute a clear specification of an algorithm. see also
