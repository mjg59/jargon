 GEDANKEN (g@-dahn'kn) [from Einstein's term "gedanken-experimenten", such as
the standard proof that E=mc^2] adj. An AI project which is written up in
grand detail without ever being implemented to any great extent. Usually
perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or find programming
distasteful or are just in a hurry. A gedanken thesis is usually marked by an
obvious lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is not and
about what does and does not constitute a clear specification of a
program-related concept such as an algorithm.
