 GEDANKEN /g@-dahn'kn/ adj. Wild-eyed; impractical; not well-thought-out;
untried; untested. "Gedanken" is a German word for "thought". A thought
experiment is one you carry out in your head. In physics, the term "gedanken
experiment" is used to refer to an experiment that is impractical to carry
out, but useful to consider because you can reason about it theoretically. (A
classic gedanken experiment of relativity theory involves thinking about a
man flying through space in an elevator.) Gedanken experiments are very
useful in physics, but you have to be careful. It was a gedanken experiment
that led Aristotle to conclude that heavy things always fall faster than
light things (he thought about a rock and a feather); this was accepted until
Galileo proved otherwise. Among hackers, however, the word has a pejorative
connotation. It is said of a project, especially one in artificial
intelligence research, which is written up in grand detail (typically as a
Ph.D. thesis) without ever being implemented to any great extent. Such a
project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or find
programming distasteful or are just in a hurry. A gedanken thesis is usually
marked by an obvious lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is
not, and about what does and does not constitute a clear specification an
algorithm.
