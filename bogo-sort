 :bogo-sort: /boh`goh-sort'/ n. (var. `stupid-sort') The archetypical
perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to {bubble sort}, which is merely the
generic *bad* algorithm). Bogo-sort is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a
deck of cards in the air, picking them up at random, and then testing whether
they are in order. It serves as a sort of canonical example of awfulness.
Looking at a program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one might say "Oh, I see,
this program uses bogo-sort." Compare {bogus}, {brute force}.
