 STACK n. see PDL. The STACK usage is probably more common outside
universities. The usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a
cafeteria: a pile of plates sitting on a spring in a well in a cart, so that
when you put a plate on the top they all sink down, and when you take one off
the top the rest spring up a bit.
