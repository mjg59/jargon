 :pink contract: [spamfighters: from the color of the tinned meat] A contract
from an Internet service provider to a spammer exempting the spammer from the
usual terms of service prohibiting spamming. Usually pink contracts come
about because ISPs can charge the spammer a great deal more than they would a
normal client.
