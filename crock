 CROCK [from mainstream "crock of shit"] n. 1. An awkward feature or
programming technique that ought to be made cleaner. Example: Using small
integers to represent error codes without the program interpreting them to
the user (as in, for example, UNIX make(1)) is a crock. 2. Also, a technique
that works acceptably but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the
least, for example depending on the machine opcodes having particular bit
patterns so that you can use instructions as data words too; a tightly woven,
almost completely unmodifiable structure.
