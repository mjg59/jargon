 CROCK [probably from "layman" slang, which in turn may be derived from
"crock of shit"] n. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to
be made cleaner. Example: Using small integers to represent error codes
without the program interpreting them to the user is a crock. Also, a
technique that works acceptably but which is quite prone to failure if
disturbed in the least, for example depending on the machine opcodes hav- ing
particular bit patterns so that you can use instruc- tions as data words too;
a tightly woven, almost com- pletely unmodifiable structure.
