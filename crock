 :crock: [from the obvious mainstream scatologism] n. 1. An awkward feature
or programming technique that ought to be made cleaner. Using small integers
to represent error codes without the program interpreting them to the user
(as in, for example, UNIX `make(1)', which returns code 139 for a process
that dies due to {segfault}). 2. A technique that works acceptably, but which
is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the least, for example depending on
the machine opcodes having particular bit patterns so that you can use
instructions as data words too; a tightly woven, almost completely
unmodifiable structure. see {kluge}, {brittle}. Also in the adjectives
`crockish' and `crocky', and the nouns `crockishness' and `crockitude'.
