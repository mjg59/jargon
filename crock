 :crock: [from the American scatologism crock of shit] n. 1. An awkward
feature or programming technique that ought to be made cleaner. For example,
using small integers to represent error codes without the program
interpreting them to the user (as in, for example, UNIX `make(1)', which
returns code 139 for a process that dies due to {segfault}). 2. A technique
that works acceptably, but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in
the least. For example, a too-clever programmer might write an assembler
which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes algorithmically, a
trick which depends far too intimately on the particular bit patterns of the
opcodes. (For another example of programming with a dependence on actual
opcode values, see {The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer} in {Appendix A}.)
Many crocks have a tightly woven, almost completely unmodifiable structure.
see {kluge}, {brittle}. The adjectives `crockish' and `crocky', and the nouns
`crockishness' and `crockitude', are also used.
