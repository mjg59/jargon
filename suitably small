 :suitably small: adj. [perverted from mathematical jargon] An expression
used ironically to characterize unquantifiable behavior that differs from
expected or required behavior. For example, suppose a newly created program
came up with a correct full-screen display, and one publicly exclaimed: "It
works!" Then, if the program dumped core on the first mouse click, one might
add: "Well, for suitably small values of `works'."
