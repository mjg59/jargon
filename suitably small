 :suitably small: [perverted from mathematical jargon] adj. An expression
used ironically to characterize unquantifiable behavior that differs from
expected or required behavior. For example, suppose a newly created program
came up with a correct full-screen display, and one publicly exclaimed: "It
works!" Then, if the program dumps core on the first mouse click, one might
add: "Well, for suitably small values of `works'." Compare the
characterization of pi under {{random numbers}}.
