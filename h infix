 H INFIX [from SF fandom] A method of "marking" common words in the
linguist's sense, i.e. calling attention to the fact that they are being used
in a nonstandard, ironic or humorous way. Orig. in the fannish catchphrase
"Bheer is the One True Ghod" from decades ago. H-infix marking of "Ghod" and
other words spread into the Sixties counterculture via underground comix, and
into early hackerdom either from the counterculture or SF fandom (all three
overlapped heavily at the time). More recently, the h infix has become an
expected feature of benchmark names, i.e. Whetstone, Dhrystone, Rhealstone,
etc; this is prob. patterning on the original Whetstone name but influenced
by the fannish/counterculture H infix.
