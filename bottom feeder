 :bottom feeder: n. 1. An Internet user that leeches off ISPs - the sort you
can never provide good enough services for, always complains about the price,
no matter how low it may be, and will bolt off to another service the moment
there is even the slimmest price difference. While most bottom feeders infest
free or almost free services such as AOL, MSN, and Hotmail, too many flock to
whomever happens to be the cheapest regional ISP at the time. Bottom feeders
are often the classic problem user, known for unleashing spam, flamage, and
other breaches of {netiquette}. 2. Syn. for {slopsucker}, derived from the
fishermen's and naturalists' term for finny creatures who subsist on the
primordial ooze. (This sense is older.)
