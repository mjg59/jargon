 :semi: /se'mee/ or /se'mi:/ 1. /n./ Abbreviation for `semicolon', when
speaking. "Commands to {grind} are prefixed by semi-semi-star" means that the
prefix is `;;*', not 1/4 of a star. 2. A prefix used with words such as
`immediately' as a qualifier. "When is the system coming up?"
"Semi-immediately." (That is, maybe not for an hour.) "We did consider that
possibility semi-seriously." see also {infinite}.
