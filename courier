 :courier: [BBS & cracker cultures] A person who distributes newly cracked
{warez}, as opposed to a {server} who makes them available for download or a
{leech} who merely downloads them. Hackers recognize this term but don't use
it themselves, as the act is not part of their culture. see also {warez
d00dz}, {cracker}, {elite}.
