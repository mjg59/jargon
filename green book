 :Green Book: n. 1. One of the three standard {PostScript} references:
`PostScript Language Program Design', bylined `Adobe Systems'
(Addison-Wesley, 1988; QA76.73.P67P66 ISBN; 0-201-14396-8); see also {Red
Book}, {Blue Book}, and the {White Book} (sense 2)). 2. Informal name for one
of the three standard references on SmallTalk: `Smalltalk-80: Bits of
History, Words of Advice', by Glenn Krasner (Addison-Wesley, 1983;
QA76.8.S635S58; ISBN 0-201-11669-3) (this, too, is associated with blue and
red books). 3. The `X/Open Compatibility Guide'. Defines an international
standard {{UNIX}} environment that is a proper superset of POSIX/SVID; also
includes descriptions of a standard utility toolkit, systems administrations
features, and the like. This grimoire is taken with particular seriousness in
Europe. see {Purple Book}. 4. The IEEE 1003.1 POSIX Operating Systems
Interface standard has been dubbed "The Ugly Green Book". 5. Any of the 1992
standards which will be issued by the CCITT's tenth plenary assembly. Until
now, these have changed color each review cycle (1984 was {Red Book}, 1988
{Blue Book}); however, it is rumored that this convention is going to be
dropped before 1992. These include, among other things, the X.400 email
standard and the Group 1 through 4 fax standards. see also {{book titles}}.
