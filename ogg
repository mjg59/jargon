 :ogg: /og/, v. [CMU] 1. In the multi-player space combat game Netrek, to
execute kamikaze attacks against enemy ships which are carrying armies or
occupying strategic positions. Named during a game in which one of the
players repeatedly used the tactic while playing Orion ship G, showing up in
the player list as "Og". This trick has been roundly denounced by those who
would return to the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting was
dominant, but as Sun Tzu wrote, "What is of supreme importance in war is to
attack the enemy's strategy, not his tactics." However, the traditional
answer to the newbie question "What does ogg mean?" is just "Pick up some
armies and I'll show you." 2. In other games, to forcefully attack an
opponent with the expectation that the resources expended will be renewed
faster than the opponent will be able to regain his previous advantage. Taken
more seriously as a tactic since it has gained a simple name. 3. To do
anything forcefully, possibly without consideration of the drain on future
resources. "I guess I'd better go ogg the problem set that's due tomorrow."
"Whoops! I looked down at the map for a sec and almost ogged that oncoming
car."
