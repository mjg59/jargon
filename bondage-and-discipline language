 BONDAGE-AND-DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE (bon'd@j @n dis'@-plin lang'w@j) A language
such as Pascal, APL, or Prolog that, though ostensibly general-purpose, is
designed so as to enforce an author's theory of "right programming" even
though said theory is demonstrably inadequate for systems or even vanilla
general-purpose programming. see LANGUAGES OF CHOICE.
