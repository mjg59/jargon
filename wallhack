 :wallhack: A form of game cheat especially associated with first-person
shooters like Quake, in which the walls in the simulated maze or dungeon are
rendered transparent to the cheater. This gives the cheater normally hidden
information about the whereabouts of other players. Beyond gaming, a wallhack
is the paradigm case of a whole class of security problems that stem from the
fact that a server cannot trust client software, and server authors must
assume that all computation farmed out to a client is exposed to and can be
interfered with by the user.
