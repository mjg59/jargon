 :TOPS-10:: /tops-ten/ n. DEC's proprietary OS for the fabled {PDP-10}
machines, long a favorite of hackers but now effectively extinct. A fountain
of hacker folklore; see {Appendix A}. see also {{ITS}}, {{TOPS-20}},
{{TWENEX}}, {VMS}, {operating system}. TOPS-10 was sometimes called BOTS-10
(from `bottoms-ten') as a comment on the inappropriateness of describing it
as the top of anything.
