 :spider food: n. Keywords embedded (usually invisibly) into a web page to
attract search engines (spiders). The intended result of including spider
food in one's web page is to insure that the page appears high on the list of
matching entries to a search engine query. There are right and wrong ways to
do this; the right way is a discreet `meta keywords' tag, the wrong way is to
embed many repeats of a keyword in comments (and many search engines now
detect and ignore the latter).
