 ORIENTAL FOOD (oh-ree-en'tl food) n. Hackers display an intense tropism
towards Oriental cuisine, especially Chinese, and especially of the spicier
varieties such as Szechuan and Hunan. This phenomenon (which has also been
observed in subcultures which overlap heavily with hackerdom, most notably
science-fiction fandom) has never been satisfactorily explained, but is
sufficiently intense that one can assume the target of a hackish dinner
expedition to be the best local Chinese place and be right at least 3 times
out of 4. see also CHINESE RAVS, GREAT-WALL, STIR-FRIED RANDOM.
