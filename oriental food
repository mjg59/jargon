 :oriental food: n. Hackers display an intense tropism towards oriental
cuisine, especially Chinese, and especially of the spicier varieties such as
Szechuan and Hunan. This phenomenon (which has also been observed in
subcultures that overlap heavily with hackerdom, most notably science-fiction
fandom) has never been satisfactorily explained, but is sufficiently intense
that one can assume the target of a hackish dinner expedition to be the best
local Chinese place and be right at least three times out of four. see also

Fish}. Thai, Indian, Korean, Burmese, and Vietnamese cuisines are also quite
popular.
