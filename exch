 PRIME old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the disease from
Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled
heroically to cure it. Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies as
one of the most {cretinous} design tradeoffs ever made. see {meta bit}.
:Dread Questionmark Disease: n. The result of saving HTML from Microsoft Word
or some other program that uses the nonstandard Microsoft variant of Latin-1;
the symptom is that various of those nonstandard characters in positions
128-160 show up as questionmarks. The usual culprit is the misnamed `smart
quotes' feature in Microsoft Word. For more details (and a program called
`demoroniser' that cleans up the mess) see
`http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/demoroniser/'. :DRECNET: /drek'net/ n.
[from Yiddish/German `dreck', meaning filth] Deliberate distortion of DECNET,
a networking protocol used in the {VMS} community. So called because {DEC}
helped write the Ethernet specification and then (either stupidly or as a
malignant customer-control tactic) violated that spec in the design of
DRECNET in a way that made it incompatible. see also {connector conspiracy}.
:driver: n. 1. The {main loop} of an event-processing program; the code that
gets commands and dispatches them for execution. 2. [techspeak] In `device
driver', code designed to handle a particular peripheral device such as a
magnetic disk or tape unit. 3. In the TeX world and the computerized
typesetting world in general, a program that translates some
device-independent or other common format to something a real device can
actually understand. :droid: n. [from `android', SF terminology for a
humanoid robot of essentially biological (as opposed to
mechanical/electronic) construction] A person (esp. a low-level bureaucrat or
service-business employee) exhibiting most of the following characteristics:
(a) naive trust in the wisdom of the parent organization or `the system'; (b)
a blind-faith propensity to believe obvious nonsense emitted by authority
figures (or computers!); (c) a rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or
unable to look beyond the `letter of the law' in exceptional situations; (d)
a paralyzing fear of official reprimand or worse if Procedures are not
followed No Matter What; and (e) no interest in doing anything above or
beyond the call of a very narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in
fixing that which is broken; an "It's not my job, man" attitude. Typical
droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and bank clerk; the
syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees. The implication
is that the rules and official procedures constitute software that the droid
is executing; problems arise when the software has not been properly
debugged. The term `droid mentality' is also used to describe the mindset
behind this behavior. Compare {suit}, {marketroid}; see {-oid}. In England
there is equivalent mainstream slang; a `jobsworth' is an obstructive,
rule-following bureaucrat, often of the uniformed or suited variety. Named
for the habit of denying a reasonable request by sucking his teeth and saying
"Oh no, guv, sorry I can't help you: that's more than my job's worth".
:drone: n. Ignorant sales or customer service personnel in computer or
electronics superstores. Characterized by a lack of even superficial
knowledge about the products they sell, yet possessed of the conviction that
they are more competent than their hacker customers. Usage: "That video board
probably sucks, it was recommended by a drone at Fry's" In the year 2000,
their natural habitats include Fry's Electronics, Best Buy, and CompUSA.
:drool-proof paper: n. Documentation that has been obsessively {dumbed down},
to the point where only a {cretin} could bear to read it, is said to have
succumbed to the `drool-proof paper syndrome' or to have been `written on
drool-proof paper'. For example, this is an actual quote from Apple's
LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your LaserWriter to open fire or flame."
:drop on the floor: vt. To react to an error condition by silently discarding
messages or other valuable data. "The gateway ran out of memory, so it just
started dropping packets on the floor." Also frequently used of faulty mail
and netnews relay sites that lose messages. see also {black hole}, {bit
bucket}. :drop-ins: n. [prob. by analogy with {drop-outs}] Spurious
characters appearing on a terminal or console as a result of line noise or a
system malfunction of some sort. Esp. used when these are interspersed with
one's own typed input. Compare {drop-outs}, sense 2. :drop-outs: n. 1. A
variety of `power glitch' (see {glitch}); momentary 0 voltage on the
electrical mains. 2. Missing characters in typed input due to software
malfunction or system saturation (one cause of such behavior under Unix when
a bad connection to a modem swamps the processor with spurious character
interrupts; see {screaming tty}). 3. Mental glitches; used as a way of
describing those occasions when the mind just seems to shut down for a couple
of beats. see {glitch}, {fried}. :drugged: adj. (also `on drugs') 1.
Conspicuously stupid, heading toward {brain-damaged}. Often accompanied by a
pantomime of toking a joint. 2. Of hardware, very slow relative to normal
performance. :drum: adj, n. Ancient techspeak term referring to slow,
cylindrical magnetic media that were once state-of-the-art storage devices.
Under BSD Unix the disk partition used for swapping is still called
`/dev/drum'; this has led to considerable humor and not a few straight-faced
but utterly bogus `explanations' getting foisted on {newbie}s. see also "{The
Story of Mel}" in Appendix A. :drunk mouse syndrome: n. (also `mouse on
drugs') A malady exhibited by the mouse pointing device of some computers.
The typical symptom is for the mouse cursor on the screen to move in random
directions and not in sync with the motion of the actual mouse. Can usually
be corrected by unplugging the mouse and plugging it back again. Another
recommended fix for optical mice is to rotate your mouse pad 90 degrees. At
Xerox PARC in the 1970s, most people kept a can of copier cleaner (isopropyl
alcohol) at their desks. When the steel ball on the mouse had picked up
enough {cruft} to be unreliable, the mouse was doused in cleaner, which
restored it for a while. However, this operation left a fine residue that
accelerated the accumulation of cruft, so the dousings became more and more
frequent. Finally, the mouse was declared `alcoholic' and sent to the clinic
to be dried out in a CFC ultrasonic bath. :dub dub dub: [common] Spoken-only
shorthand for the "www" (double-u double-u double-u) in many web host names.
Nothing to do with the style of reggae music called `dub'. :Duff's device: n.
The most dramatic use yet seen of {fall through} in C, invented by Tom Duff
when he was at Lucasfilm. Trying to {bum} all the instructions he could out
of an inner loop that copied data serially onto an output port, he decided to
unroll it. He then realized that the unrolled version could be implemented by
_interlacing_ the structures of a switch and a loop: register n = (count + 7)
/ 8; /* count > 0 assumed */ switch (count % 8) { case 0: do { *to = *from++;
case 7: *to = *from++; case 6: *to = *from++; case 5: *to = *from++; case 4:
*to = *from++; case 3: *to = *from++; case 2: *to = *from++; case 1: *to =
*from++; } while (--n > 0); } Shocking though it appears to all who encounter
it for the first time, the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C. C's
default {fall through} in case statements has long been its most
controversial single feature; Duff observed that "This code forms some sort
of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's for or against."
Duff has discussed the device in detail at
`http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html'. Note that the omission of
postfix `++' from `*to' was intentional (though confusing). Duff's device can
be used to implement memory copy, but the original aim was to copy values
serially into a magic IO register. [For maximal obscurity, the outermost pair
of braces above could be actually be removed -- GLS] :dumb terminal: n. A
terminal that is one step above a {glass tty}, having a minimally addressable
cursor but no on-screen editing or other features normally supported by a
{smart terminal}. Once upon a time, when glass ttys were common and
addressable cursors were something special, what is now called a dumb
terminal could pass for a smart terminal. :dumbass attack: /duhm'as *-tak'/
n. [Purdue] Notional cause of a novice's mistake made by the experienced,
especially one made while running as {root} under Unix, e.g., typing `rm -r
*' or `mkfs' on a mounted file system. Compare {adger}. :dumbed down: adj.
Simplified, with a strong connotation of _over_simplified. Often, a
{marketroid} will insist that the interfaces and documentation of software be
dumbed down after the designer has burned untold gallons of midnight oil
making it smart. This creates friction. see {user-friendly}. :dump: n. 1. An
undigested and voluminous mass of information about a problem or the state of
a system, especially one routed to the slowest available output device
(compare {core dump}), and most especially one consisting of hex or octal
{runes} describing the byte-by-byte state of memory, mass storage, or some
file. In {elder days}, debugging was generally done by `groveling over' a
dump (see {grovel}); increasing use of high-level languages and interactive
debuggers has made such tedium uncommon, and the term `dump' now has a
faintly archaic flavor. 2. A backup. This usage is typical only at large
timesharing installations. :dumpster diving: /dump'-ster di:'-ving/ n. 1. The
practice of sifting refuse from an office or technical installation to
extract confidential data, especially security-compromising information
(`dumpster' is an Americanism for what is elsewhere called a `skip'). Back in
AT&T's monopoly days, before paper shredders became common office equipment,
phone phreaks (see {phreaking}) used to organize regular dumpster runs
against phone company plants and offices. Discarded and damaged copies of
AT&T internal manuals taught them much. The technique is still rumored to be
a favorite of crackers operating against careless targets. 2. The practice of
raiding the dumpsters behind buildings where producers and/or consumers of
high-tech equipment are located, with the expectation (usually justified) of
finding discarded but still-valuable equipment to be nursed back to health in
some hacker's den. Experienced dumpster-divers not infrequently accumulate
basements full of moldering (but still potentially useful) {cruft}. :dup
killer: /d[y]oop kill'r/ n. [FidoNet] Software that is supposed to detect and
delete duplicates of a message that may have reached the FidoNet system via
different routes. :dup loop: /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop') n. [FidoNet]
An infinite stream of duplicated, near-identical messages on a FidoNet
{echo}, the only difference being unique or mangled identification
information applied by a faulty or incorrectly configured system or network
gateway, thus rendering {dup killer}s ineffective. If such a duplicate
message eventually reaches a system through which it has already passed (with
the original identification information), all systems passed on the way back
to that system are said to be involved in a {dup loop}. :dusty deck: n. Old
software (especially applications) which one is obliged to remain compatible
with, or to maintain ({DP} types call this `legacy code', a term hackers
consider smarmy and excessively reverent). The term implies that the software
in question is a holdover from card-punch days. Used esp. when referring to
old scientific and {number-crunching} software, much of which was written in
FORTRAN and very poorly documented but is believed to be too expensive to
replace. see {fossil}; compare {crawling horror}. :DWIM: /dwim/ [acronym, `Do
What I Mean'] 1. adj. Able to guess, sometimes even correctly, the result
intended when bogus input was provided. 2. n. obs. The BBNLISP/INTERLISP
function that attempted to accomplish this feat by correcting many of the
more common errors. see {hairy}. 3. Occasionally, an interjection hurled at a
balky computer, esp. when one senses one might be tripping over legalisms
(see {legalese}). 4. Of a person, someone whose directions are
incomprehensible and vague, but who nevertheless has the expectation that you
will solve the problem using the specific method he/she has in mind. Warren
Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling errors, so it
was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often make hash of anyone
else's typos if they were stylistically different. Some victims of DWIM thus
claimed that the acronym stood for `Damn Warren's Infernal Machine!'. In one
notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command interpreter
used at Xerox PARC. One day another hacker there typed `delete *$' to free up
some disk space. (The editor there named backup files by appending `$' to the
original file name, so he was trying to delete any backup files left over
from old editing sessions.) It happened that there weren't any editor backup
files, so DWIM helpfully reported `*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete
*'.' It then started to delete all the files on the disk! The hacker managed
to stop it with a {Vulcan nerve pinch} after only a half dozen or so files
were lost. The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go
to Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation,
and then type `delete *$' twice. DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired
feature for a complex program; it is also occasionally described as the
single instruction the ideal computer would have. Back when proofs of program
correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about `DWIMC' (Do What I
Mean, Correctly). A related term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The
Right Thing); see {Right Thing}. :dynner: /din'r/ n. 32 bits, by analogy with
{nybble} and {{byte}}. Usage: rare and extremely silly. see also {playte},
{tayste}, {crumb}. General discussion of such terms is under {nybble}. = E =
===== :earthquake: n. [IBM] The ultimate real-world shock test for computer
hardware. Hackish sources at IBM deny the rumor that the Bay Area quake of
1989 was initiated by the company to test quality-assurance procedures at its
California plants. :Easter egg: n. [from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt
observed in the U.S. and many parts of Europe] 1. A message hidden in the
object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by persons
disassembling or browsing the code. 2. A message, graphic, or sound effect
emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in response to some
undocumented set of commands or keystrokes, intended as a joke or to display
program credits. One well-known early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes
caused them to respond to the command `make love' with `not war?'. Many
personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM, including
lists of the developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music,
and (in one case) graphics images of the entire development team. :Easter
egging: n. [IBM] The act of replacing unrelated components more or less at
random in hopes that a malfunction will go away. Hackers consider this the
normal operating mode of {field circus} techs and do not love them for it.
see also the jokes under {field circus}. Compare {shotgun debugging}. :eat
flaming death: imp. A construction popularized among hackers by the infamous
{CPU Wars} comic; supposedly derive from a famously turgid line in a WWII-era
anti-Nazi propaganda comic that ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan mongrels!"
or something of the sort (however, it is also reported that the Firesign
Theatre's 1975 album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own" a character won
the right to scream "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs" in the middle of
Oscar night on a game show; this may have been an influence). Used in
humorously overblown expressions of hostility. "Eat flaming death, {{EBCDIC}}
users!" :EBCDIC:: /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ n. [abbreviation,
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An alleged character set used
on IBM {dinosaur}s. It exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions,
all featuring such delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the
absence of several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern
computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies according to
which version of EBCDIC you're looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from {{punched
card}} code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control
tactic (see {connector conspiracy}), spurning the already established ASCII
standard. Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own
description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still
internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers blanch at the
very _name_ of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of purest {evil}. see
also {fear and loathing}. :echo: [FidoNet] n. A {topic group} on {FidoNet}'s
echomail system. Compare {newsgroup}. :ECP: /E-C-P/ n. see {spam} and
{velveeta}. :ed: n. "ed is the standard text editor." Line taken from
original the {Unix} manual page on ed, an ancient line-oriented editor that
is by now used only by a few {Real Programmer}s, and even then only for batch
operations. The original line is sometimes uttered near the beginning of an
emacs vs. vi holy war on {Usenet}, with the (vain) hope to quench the
discussion before it really takes off. Often followed by a standard text
describing the many virtues of ed (such as the small memory {footprint} on a
Timex Sinclair, and the consistent (because nearly non-existent) user
interface). :egosurf: vi. To search the net for your name or links to your
web pages. Perhaps connected to long-established SF-fan slang `egoscan', to
search for one's name in a fanzine. :eighty-column mind: n. [IBM] The sort
said to be possessed by persons for whom the transition from {punched card}
to tape was traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet). It is
said that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder of
IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being the bottom of
the card). This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1402 and 1622 card readers
and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel called "The Last Bug", the
climactic lines of which are as follows: He died at the console Of hunger and
thirst. Next day he was buried, Face down, 9-edge first. The eighty-column
mind was thought by most hackers to dominate IBM's customer base and its
thinking. This only began to change in the mid-1990s when IBM began to
reinvent itself after the triumph of the {killer micro}. see {IBM}, {fear and
loathing}, {card walloper}. A copy of "The Last Bug" lives on the the GNU
site at `http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/last.bug.html'. :El Camino Bignum: /el'
k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ n. The road mundanely called El Camino Real, running
along San Francisco peninsula. It originally extended all the way down to
Mexico City; many portions of the old road are still intact. Navigation on
the San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real, which
defines {logical} north and south even though it isn't really north-south in
many places. El Camino Real runs right past Stanford University and so is
familiar to hackers. The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables:
/ray-ahl'/) means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'. In the FORTRAN
language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to seven
significant digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger
floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant digits (other
languages have similar `real' types). When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford
in 1976, he remarked what a long road El Camino Real was. Making a pun on
`real', he started calling it `El Camino Double Precision' -- but when the
hacker was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it `El
Camino Bignum', and that name has stuck. (see {bignum}.) [GLS has since let
slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was in fact himself --ESR] In
recent years, the synonym `El Camino Virtual' has been reported as an
alternate at IBM and Amdahl sites in the Valley. Mathematically literate
hackers in the Valley have also been heard to refer to some major
cross-street intersecting El Camino Real as "El Camino Imaginary". One
popular theory is that the intersection is located near Moffett Field - where
they keep all those complex planes. :elder days: n. The heroic age of
hackerdom (roughly, pre-1980); the era of the {PDP-10}, {TECO}, {{ITS}}, and
the ARPANET. This term has been rather consciously adopted from J. R. R.
Tolkien's fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings". Compare {Iron Age}; see also
{elvish} and {Great Worm}. :elegant: adj. [common; from mathematical usage]
Combining simplicity, power, and a certain ineffable grace of design. Higher
praise than `clever', `winning', or even {cuspy}. The French aviator,
adventurer, and author Antoine de Saint-Exupe'ry, probably best known for his
classic children's book "The Little Prince", was also an aircraft designer.
He gave us perhaps the best definition of engineering elegance when he said
"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left
to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." :elephantine: adj. Used
of programs or systems that are both conspicuous {hog}s (owing perhaps to
poor design founded on {brute force and ignorance}) and exceedingly {hairy}
in source form. An elephantine program may be functional and even friendly,
but (as in the old joke about being in bed with an elephant) it's tough to
have around all the same (and, like a pachyderm, difficult to maintain). In
extreme cases, hackers have been known to make trumpeting sounds or perform
expressive proboscatory mime at the mention of the offending program. Usage:
semi-humorous. Compare `has the elephant nature' and the somewhat more
pejorative {monstrosity}. see also {second-system effect} and {baroque}.
:elevator controller: n. An archetypal dumb embedded-systems application,
like {toaster} (which superseded it). During one period (1983-84) in the
deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C standardization committee) this was the
canonical example of a really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.
"You can't require `printf(3)' to be part of the default runtime library --
what if you're targeting an elevator controller?" Elevator controllers became
important rhetorical weapons on both sides of several {holy wars}. :elite:
adj. Clueful. Plugged-in. One of the cognoscenti. Also used as a general
positive adjective. This term is not actually hacker slang in the strict
sense; it is used primarily by crackers and {warez d00dz}, for which reason
hackers use it only with heavy irony. The term used to refer to the folks
allowed in to the "hidden" or "privileged" sections of BBSes in the early
1980s (which, typically, contained pirated software). Frequently, early
boards would only let you post, or even see, a certain subset of the sections
(or `boards') on a BBS. Those who got to the frequently legendary `triple
super secret' boards were elite. Misspellings of this term in warez d00dz
style abound; the forms `eleet', and `31337' (among others) have been
sighted. A true hacker would be more likely to use `wizardly'. Oppose
{lamer}. :ELIZA effect: /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ n. [AI community] The tendency of
humans to attach associations to terms from prior experience. For example,
there is nothing magic about the symbol `+' that makes it well-suited to
indicate addition; it's just that people associate it with addition. Using
`+' or `plus' to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of
the ELIZA effect. This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph
Weizenbaum, which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient. It
worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into
canned phrases. It was so convincing, however, that there are many anecdotes
about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA. All
this was due to people's tendency to attach to words meanings which the
computer never put there. The ELIZA effect is a {Good Thing} when writing a
programming language, but it can blind you to serious shortcomings when
analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system. Compare {ad-hockery}; see also
{AI-complete}. Sources for a clone of the original Eliza are available at
`ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/pub/AI_ATTIC/Programs/Classic/Eliza/Eliza.c'.
:elvish: n. 1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms resembling the
beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book of Kells". Invented and
described by J. R. R. Tolkien in "The Lord of The Rings" as an orthography
for his fictional `elvish' languages, this system (which is both visually and
phonetically {elegant}) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to be intrigued
by artificial languages in general). It is traditional for graphics printers,
plotters, window systems, and the like to support a Feanorian typeface as one
of their demo items. see also {elder days}. 2. By extension, any odd or
unreadable typeface produced by a graphics device. 3. The typeface mundanely
called `Bo"cklin', an art-Noveau display font. :EMACS: /ee'maks/ n. [from
Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text
editor with an entire LISP system inside it. It was originally written by
Richard Stallman in {TECO} under {{ITS}} at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554
described it as "an advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible
real-time display editor". It has since been reimplemented any number of
times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major
operating systems. Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by
Stallman and now called "{GNU} EMACS" or {GNUMACS}, runs principally under
Unix. (Its close relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.) It
includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail
or news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their {tube time} inside it. Other
variants include {GOSMACS}, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS,
jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS. (Though we use the original all-caps spelling
here, it is nowadays very commonly `Emacs'.) Some EMACS versions running
under window managers iconify as an overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to
suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet) include. Indeed, some
hackers find EMACS too {heavyweight} and {baroque} for their taste, and
expand the name as `Escape Meta Alt Control Shift' to spoof its heavy
reliance on keystrokes decorated with {bucky bits}. Other spoof expansions
include `Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping' (from when that was a lot
of {core}), `Eventually `malloc()'s All Computer Storage', and `EMACS Makes A
Computer Slow' (see {{recursive acronym}}). see also {vi}. :email: /ee'mayl/
(also written `e-mail' and `E-mail') 1. n. Electronic mail automatically
passed through computer networks and/or via modems over common-carrier lines.
Contrast {snail-mail}, {paper-net}, {voice-net}. see {network address}. 2.
vt. To send electronic mail. Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually
listed in the OED; it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh.
arranged in a net or open work". A use from 1480 is given. The word is
probably derived from French `e'maille" (enameled) and related to Old French
`emmailleu"re' (network). A French correspondent tells us that in modern
French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by heating special paints in a
furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is a craftsman who makes email (he
generally paints some objects (like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a
furnace). There are numerous spelling variants of this word. In Internet
traffic up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a not-too-distant
second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant third and fourth. :emoticon:
/ee-moh'ti-kon/ n. [common] An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional
state in email or news. Although originally intended mostly as jokes,
emoticons (or some other explicit humor indication) are virtually required
under certain circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums
such as Usenet; the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what
were intended to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise
non-100%-serious comments to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by
{newbie}s), resulting in arguments and {flame war}s. Hundreds of emoticons
have been proposed, but only a few are in common use. These include: :-)
`smiley face' (for humor, laughter, friendliness, occasionally sarcasm) :-(
`frowney face' (for sadness, anger, or upset) ;-) `half-smiley' ({ha ha only
serious}); also known as `semi-smiley' or `winkey face'. :-/ `wry face'
(These may become more comprehensible if you tilt your head sideways, to the
left.) The first two listed are by far the most frequently encountered.
Hyphenless forms of them are common on CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX; see also
{bixie}. On {Usenet}, `smiley' is often used as a generic term synonymous
with {emoticon}, as well as specifically for the happy-face emoticon. It
appears that the emoticon was invented by one Scott Fahlman on the CMU
{bboard} systems sometime between early 1981 and mid-1982. He later wrote: "I
wish I had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date for
posterity, but I had no idea that I was starting something that would soon
pollute all the world's communication channels." [GLS confirms that he
remembers this original posting]. Note for the {newbie}: Overuse of the
smiley is a mark of loserhood! More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure
sign that you've gone over the line. :EMP: /E-M-P/ see {spam}. :empire: n.
Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game written by Peter
Langston many years ago. A number of multi-player variants of varying degrees
of sophistication exist, and one single-player version implemented for both
Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as MS-DOS freeware. All are
notoriously addictive. Of various commercial derivatives the best known is
probably "Empire Deluxe" on PCs and Amigas. Modern empire is a real-time
wargame played over the internet by up to 120 players. Typical games last
from 24 hours (blitz) to a couple of months (long term). The amount of sleep
you can get while playing is a function of the rate at which updates occur
and the number of co-rulers of your country. Empire server software is
available for unix-like machines, and clients for Unix and other platforms. A
comprehensive history of the game is available at
`http://empire.idlpaper.com/infopages/History.html'. The Empire resource site
is at `http://empire.idlpaper.com/'. :engine: n. 1. A piece of hardware that
encapsulates some function but can't be used without some kind of {front
end}. Today we have, especially, `print engine': the guts of a laser printer.
2. An analogous piece of software; notionally, one that does a lot of noisy
crunching, such as a `database engine'. The hacker senses of `engine' are
actually close to its original, pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill,
clever device, or instrument (the word is cognate to `ingenuity'). This sense
had not been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of
power-transducing machinery in Charles Babbage's time, which explains why he
named the stored-program computer that he designed in 1844 the `Analytical
Engine'. :English: 1. n. obs. The source code for a program, which may be in
any language, as opposed to the linkable or executable binary produced from
it by a compiler. The idea behind the term is that to a real hacker, a
program written in his favorite programming language is at least as readable
as English. Usage: mostly by old-time hackers, though recognizable in
context. 2. The official name of the database language used by old the Pick
Operating System, actually a sort of crufty, brain-damaged SQL with delusions
of grandeur. The name permitted {marketroid}s to say "Yes, and you can
program our computers in English!" to ignorant {suit}s without quite running
afoul of the truth-in-advertising laws. :enhancement: n. Common
{marketroid}-speak for a bug {fix}. This abuse of language is a popular and
time-tested way to turn incompetence into increased revenue. A hacker being
ironic would instead call the fix a {feature} -- or perhaps save some effort
by declaring the bug itself to be a feature. :ENQ: /enkw/ or /enk/ [from the
ASCII mnemonic ENQuire for 0000101] An on-line convention for querying
someone's availability. After opening a {talk mode} connection to someone
apparently in heavy hack mode, one might type `SYN SYN ENQ?' (the SYNs
representing notional synchronization bytes), and expect a return of {ACK} or
{NAK} depending on whether or not the person felt interruptible. Compare
{ping}, {finger}, and the usage of `FOO?' listed under {talk mode}. :EOF:
/E-O-F/ n. [abbreviation, `End Of File'] 1. [techspeak] The {out-of-band}
value returned by C's sequential character-input functions (and their
equivalents in other environments) when end of file has been reached. This
value is usually -1 under C libraries postdating V6 Unix, but was originally
0. DOS hackers think EOF is ^Z, and a few Amiga hackers think it's ^\. 2.
[Unix] The keyboard character (usually control-D, the ASCII EOT (End Of
Transmission) character) that is mapped by the terminal driver into an
end-of-file condition. 3. Used by extension in non-computer contexts when a
human is doing something that can be modeled as a sequential read and can't
go further. "Yeah, I looked for a list of 360 mnemonics to post as a joke,
but I hit EOF pretty fast; all the library had was a {JCL} manual." see also
{EOL}. :EOL: /E-O-L/ n. [End Of Line] Syn. for {newline}, derived perhaps
from the original CDC6600 Pascal. Now rare, but widely recognized and
occasionally used for brevity. Used in the example entry under {BNF}. see
also {EOF}. :EOU: /E-O-U/ n. The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control
character (End Of User) that would make an ASR-33 Teletype explode on
receipt. This construction parodies the numerous obscure delimiter and
control characters left in ASCII from the days when it was associated more
with wire-service teletypes than computers (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB,
ETX, and esp. EOT). It is worth remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy
mechanical beasts with a lot of clattering parts; the notion that one might
explode was nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in
front of a {tube} or flatscreen today. :epoch: n. [Unix: prob. from
astronomical timekeeping] The time and date corresponding to 0 in an
operating system's clock and timestamp values. Under most Unix versions the
epoch is 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November
17, 1858 (base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a
Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904. System time is
measured in seconds or {tick}s past the epoch. Weird problems may ensue when
the clock wraps around (see {wrap around}), which is not necessarily a rare
event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of
ticks is good only for 6.8 years. The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is good
only until January 18, 2038, assuming at least some software continues to
consider it signed and that word lengths don't increase by then. see also
{wall time}. Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, has an epoch problem every
49.7 days - but this is seldom noticed as Windows is almost incapable of
staying up continuously for that long. :epsilon: [see {delta}] 1. n. A small
quantity of anything. "The cost is epsilon." 2. adj. Very small, negligible;
less than {marginal}. "We can get this feature for epsilon cost." 3. `within
epsilon of': close enough to be indistinguishable for all practical purposes,
even closer than being `within delta of'. "That's not what I asked for, but
it's within epsilon of what I wanted." Alternatively, it may mean not close
enough, but very little is required to get it there: "My program is within
epsilon of working." :epsilon squared: n. A quantity even smaller than
{epsilon}, as small in comparison to epsilon as epsilon is to something
normal; completely negligible. If you buy a supercomputer for a million
dollars, the cost of the thousand-dollar terminal to go with it is {epsilon},
and the cost of the ten-dollar cable to connect them is epsilon squared.
Compare {lost in the underflow}, {lost in the noise}. :era: n. Syn. {epoch}.
Webster's Unabridged makes these words almost synonymous, but `era' more
often connotes a span of time rather than a point in time, whereas the
reverse is true for {epoch}. The {epoch} usage is recommended. :Eric
Conspiracy: n. A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first
pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous talk.bizarre posting ca.
1987; this was doubtless influenced by the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty
Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed Erics
in hackerdom than the frequency of these three traits can account for unless
they are correlated in some arcane way. Well-known examples include Eric
Allman (he of the `Allman style' described under {indent style}) and Erik
Fair (co-author of NNTP); your editor has heard from more than sixty others
by email, and the organization line `Eric Conspiracy Secret Laboratories' now
emanates regularly from more than one site. see the Eric Conspiracy Web Page
at `http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ecsl/' for full details. :Eris: /e'ris/ n. The
Greek goddess of Chaos, Discord, Confusion, and Things You Know Not Of; her
name was latinized to Discordia and she was worshiped by that name in Rome.
Not a very friendly deity in the Classical original, she was reinvented as a
more benign personification of creative anarchy starting in 1959 by the
adherents of {Discordianism} and has since been a semi-serious subject of
veneration in several `fringe' cultures, including hackerdom. see
{Discordianism}, {Church of the SubGenius}. :erotics: /ee-ro'tiks/ n.
[Helsinki University of Technology, Finland] n. English-language university
slang for electronics. Often used by hackers in Helsinki, maybe because good
electronics excites them and makes them warm. :error 33: [XEROX PARC] n. 1.
Predicating one research effort upon the success of another. 2. Allowing your
own research effort to be placed on the critical path of some other project
(be it a research effort or not). :eurodemo: /yoor'o-dem`-o/ a {demo}, sense
4 :evil: adj. As used by hackers, implies that some system, program, person,
or institution is sufficiently maldesigned as to be not worth the bother of
dealing with. Unlike the adjectives in the
{cretinous}/{losing}/{brain-damaged} series, `evil' does not imply
incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of goals or design criteria
fatally incompatible with the speaker's. This usage is more an esthetic and
engineering judgment than a moral one in the mainstream sense. "We thought
about adding a {Blue Glue} interface but decided it was too evil to deal
with." "{TECO} is neat, but it can be pretty evil if you're prone to typos."
Often pronounced with the first syllable lengthened, as /eeee'vil/. Compare
{evil and rude}. :evil and rude: adj. Both {evil} and {rude}, but with the
additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice rather than
incompetence. Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows NT is evil because it's
a competent implementation of a bad design; it's rude because it's
gratuitously incompatible with Unix in places where compatibility would have
been as easy and effective to do; but it's evil and rude because the
incompatibilities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in Unix but
rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the Microsoft way.
Hackish evil and rude is close to the mainstream sense of `evil'. :Evil
Empire: n. [from Ronald Reagan's famous characterization of the communist
Soviet Union] Formerly {IBM}, now Microsoft. Functionally, the company most
hackers love to hate at any given time. Hackers like to see themselves as
romantic rebels against the Evil Empire, and frequently adopt this role to
the point of ascribing rather more power and malice to the Empire than it
actually has. see also {Borg} and search for Evil Empire
(http://pages.prodigy.net/rkusnery/amsind.html) pages on the Web. :exa-:
/ek's*/ pref. [SI] see {{quantifiers}}. :examining the entrails: n. The
process of {grovel}ling through a {core dump} or hex image in an attempt to
discover the bug that brought a program or system down. The reference is to
divination from the entrails of a sacrified animal. Compare {runes},
{incantation}, {black art}, {desk check}. :EXCH: /eks'ch*/ or /eksch/ vt. To
exchange two things, each for the other; to swap places. If you point to two
people sitting down and say "Exch!", you are asking them to trade places.
EXCH, meaning EXCHange, was originally the name of a PDP-10 instruction that
exchanged the contents of a register and a memory location. Many newer
hackers are probably thinking instead of the {{PostScript}} exchange operator
(which is usually written in lowercase). :excl: /eks'kl/ n. Abbreviation for
`exclamation point'. see {bang}, {shriek}, {{ASCII}}. :EXE: /eks'ee/ or
/eek'see/ or /E-X-E/ n. An executable binary file. Some operating systems
(notably MS-DOS, VMS, and TWENEX) use the extension .EXE to mark such files.
This usage is also occasionally found among Unix programmers even though Unix
executables don't have any required suffix. :exec: /eg-zek'/ or /eks'ek/ vt.,
n. 1. [Unix: from `execute'] Synonym for {chain}, derives from the `exec(2)'
call. 2. [from `executive'] obs. The command interpreter for an {OS} (see
{shell}); term esp. used around mainframes, and prob. derived from UNIVAC's
archaic EXEC 2 and EXEC 8 operating systems. 3. At IBM and VM/CMS shops, the
equivalent of a shell command file (among VM/CMS users). The mainstream
`exec' as an abbreviation for (human) executive is _not_ used. To a hacker,
an `exec' is a always a program, never a person. :exercise, left as an: adj.
[from technical books] Used to complete a proof when one doesn't mind a
{handwave}, or to avoid one entirely. The complete phrase is: "The proof [or
`the rest'] is left as an exercise for the reader." This comment _has_
occasionally been attached to unsolved research problems by authors possessed
of either an evil sense of humor or a vast faith in the capabilities of their
audiences. :Exon: /eks'on/ excl. A generic obscenity that quickly entered
wide use on the Internet and Usenet after {Black Thursday}. From the last
name of Senator James Exon (Democrat-Nebraska), primary author of the {CDA}.
:Exploder: n. Used within Microsoft to refer to the Windows Explorer, the
interface component of Windows 95 and WinNT 4. Our spies report that most of
the heavy guns at MS came from a Unix background and use command line
utilities; even they are scornful of the over-gingerbreaded {WIMP
environment}s that they have been called upon to create. :exploit: n.
[originally cracker slang] 1. A vulnerability in software that can be used
for breaking security or otherwise attacking an Internet host over the
network. The {Ping O' Death} is a famous exploit. 2. More grammatically, a
program that exploits an exploit in sense 1, :external memory: n. A memo pad,
palmtop computer, or written notes. "Hold on while I write that to external
memory". The analogy is with store or DRAM versus nonvolatile disk storage on
computers. :eye candy: /i:' kand`ee/ n. [from mainstream slang "ear candy"]
