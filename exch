 :EXCH: /eksÂ´ch@/, /eksch/, vt. To exchange two things, each for the other;
to swap places. If you point to two people sitting down and say "Exch!", you
are asking them to trade places. EXCH, meaning EXCHange, was originally the
name of a PDP-10 instruction that exchanged the contents of a register and a
memory location. Many newer hackers are probably thinking instead of the
{PostScript} exchange operator (which is usually written in lowercase).
