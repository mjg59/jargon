 :high moby: /hi:' mohb'ee/ n. The high half of a 512K {PDP-10}'s physical
address space; the other half was of course the low moby. This usage has been
generalized in a way that has outlasted the {PDP-10}; for example, at the
1990 Washington D.C. Area Science Fiction Conclave (Disclave), when a
miscommunication resulted in two separate wakes being held in commemoration
of the shutdown of MIT's last {{ITS}} machines, the one on the upper floor
was dubbed the `high moby' and the other the `low moby'. All parties involved
{grok}ked this instantly. see {moby}.
