 HIGH MOBY /hie mohb'ee/ n. The high half of a stock PDP-10's address space;
the other half was of course the LOW MOBY. This usage has been generalized in
a way that has outlasted the PDP-10; for example, at the 1990 Washington D.C
Area Science Fiction Conclave (DISCLAVE) when a miscommunication resulted in
two separate @-SIGN PARTIES being held in commemoration of the shutdown of
MIT's last ITS machines, the one on the upper floor was dubbed the HIGH MOBY
and the other the LOW MOBY. All parties involved grokked this instantly. see
MOBY in main text and Appendix B.
