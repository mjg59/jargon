 :demon dialer: n. A program which repeatedly calls the same telephone
number. Demon dialing may be benign (as when a number of communications
programs contend for legitimate access to a {BBS} line) or malign (that is,
used as a prank or denial-of-service attack). This term dates from the {blue
box} days of the 1970s and early 1980s and is now semi-obsolescent among
{phreaker}s; see {war dialer} for its contemporary progeny.
