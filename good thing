 GOOD THING adj. Always capitalized. 1. Self-evidently wonderful to anyone in
a position to notice: "The Trailblazer's 19.2Kbaud PEP mode with on-the-fly
Lempel-Ziv compression is a Good Thing for sites relaying netnews." 2.
Something which can't possibly have any ill side effects and may save
considerable grief later: "Removing the self-modifying code from that shared
library would be a Good Thing." 3. When said of software tools or libraries,
as in "YACC is a Good Thing", specifically connotes that the thing has
drastically reduced a programmer's work load. Oppose BAD THING.
