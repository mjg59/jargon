 :check: n. A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly used to refer
to actual hardware failures rather than software-induced traps. E.g., a
`parity check' is the result of a hardware-detected parity error. Recorded
here because the word often humorously extended to non-technical problems.
For example, the term `child check' has been used to refer to the problems
caused by a small child who is curious to know what happens when s/he presses
all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of course, this particular
problem could have been prevented with {molly-guard}s).
