 :cycle of reincarnation: n. [coined by Ivan Sutherland ca. 1970] Term used
to refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system family
is migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
peripheral evolves toward more computing power as it does its job, then
somebody notices that it is inefficient to support two asymmetrical
processors in the architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU,
at which point the cycle begins again. Several iterations of this cycle have
been observed in graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in
communications and floating-point processors. Also known as `the Wheel of
Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of the basic
Hindu/Buddhist theological idea. see also {blitter}, {bit bang}.
