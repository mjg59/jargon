 BANG PATH (bang path) n. An old-style UUCP electronic-mail address
specifying hops to get from some assumed-reachable location to the addressee,
so called because each hop is signified by a BANG sign. Thus the path
"...!bigsite!foovax!barbox!me" directs correspondents to route their mail to
machine bigsite (presumably a well-known location accessible to everybody)
and from there through the machine "foovax" to the account of user "me" on
"barbox". see INTERNET ADDRESS and NETWORK.
