 :point-and-drool interface: n. Parody of the techspeak term point-and-click
interface, describing a windows, icons, and mouse-based interface such as is
found on the Macintosh. The implication, of course, is that such an interface
is only suitable for idiots. see {for the rest of us}, {WIMP environment},
{Macintrash}, {drool-proof paper}. Also point-and-grunt interface.
