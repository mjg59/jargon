 OVERRUN SCREW [C programming] n. A variety of FANDANGO ON CORE produced by
scribbling past the end of an array (C has no checks for this). This is
relatively benign and easy to spot if the array is static; if it is auto, the
result may be to SMASH THE STACK. The term OVERRUN SCREW is used esp. of
scribbles beyond the end of arrays allocated with malloc(3); this typically
trashes the allocation header for the next block in the ARENA, producing
massive lossage within malloc and (frequently) a core dump on the next
operation to use stdio or malloc(3) itself. see also MEMORY LEAK, ALIASING
BUG, PRECEDENCE LOSSAGE, FANDANGO ON CORE. = P =
