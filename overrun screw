 :overrun screw: n. [C programming] A variety of {fandango on core} produced
by scribbling past the end of an array (C implementations typically have no
checks for this error). This is relatively benign and easy to spot if the
array is static; if it is auto, the result may be to {smash the stack} --
often resulting in {heisenbug}s of the most diabolical subtlety. The term
`overrun screw' is used esp. of scribbles beyond the end of arrays allocated
with `malloc(3)'; this typically trashes the allocation header for the next
block in the {arena}, producing massive lossage within malloc and often a
core dump on the next operation to use `stdio(3)' or `malloc(3)' itself. see
{spam}, {overrun}; see also {memory leak}, {memory smash}, {aliasing bug},
{precedence lossage}, {fandango on core}, {secondary damage}.
