 :spoiler: n. [Usenet] 1. A remark which reveals important plot elements from
books or movies, thus denying the reader (of the article) the proper suspense
when reading the book or watching the movie. 2. Any remark which telegraphs
the solution of a problem or puzzle, thus denying the reader the pleasure of
working out the correct answer (see also {interesting}). Either sense readily
forms compounds like `total spoiler', `quasi-spoiler' and even
`pseudo-spoiler'. By convention, articles which are spoilers in either sense
should contain the word `spoiler' in the Subject: line, or guarantee via
various tricks that the answer appears only after several screens-full of
warning, or conceal the sensitive information via {rot13}, {spoiler space} or
some combination of these techniques.
