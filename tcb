Compare {heisenbug}. Not to be confused with: 2. Trusted Computing Base, an
`official' jargon term from the {Orange Book}. tea, ISO standard cup of:
[South Africa] n. A cup of tea with milk and one teaspoon of sugar, where the
milk is poured into the cup before the tea. Variations are ISO 0, with no
sugar; ISO 2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on. Note: like many ISO
standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North America, wherein
hackers generally shun the decadent British practice of adulterating
perfectly good tea with *dairy products* and prefer instead to add a wedge of
lemon, if anything. If one were feeling extremely silly, one might
hypothesize an analogous `ANSI standard cup of tea' and wind up with a
political situation distressingly similar to several that arise in much more
serious technical contexts. Milk and lemon don't mix very well. TechRef:
[MS-DOS] n. The original `IBM PC Technical Reference Manual', including the
BIOS listing and complete schematics for the PC. The only PC documentation in
the issue package that's considered serious by real hackers.
