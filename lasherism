 :Lasherism: [Harvard] n. A program which solves a standard problem (such as
the Eight Queens puzzle or implementing the {life} algorithm) in a
deliberately nonstandard way. Distinguished from a {crock} or {kluge} by the
fact that the programmer did it on purpose as a mental exercise. Lew Lasher
was a student at Harvard around 1980 who became notorious for such behavior.
