 :Lasherism: n. [Harvard] A program that solves a standard problem (such as
the Eight Queens puzzle or implementing the {life} algorithm) in a
deliberately nonstandard way. Distinguished from a {crock} or {kluge} by the
fact that the programmer did it on purpose as a mental exercise. Such
constructions are quite popular in exercises such as the {Obfuscated C
Contest}, and occasionally in {retrocomputing}. Lew Lasher was a student at
Harvard around 1980 who became notorious for such behavior.
