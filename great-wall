 :great-wall: /vi.,n./ [from SF fandom] A mass expedition to an oriental
restaurant, esp. one where food is served family-style and shared. There is a
common heuristic about the amount of food to order, expressed as "Get N - 1
entrees"; the value of N, which is the number of people in the group, can be
inferred from context (see {N}). see {{oriental food}}, {ravs}, {stir-fried
random}.
