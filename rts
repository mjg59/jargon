 :RTS: /R·T·S/, imp. Abbreviation for `Read The Screen'. Mainly used by
hackers in the microcomputer world. Refers to what one would like to tell the
{suit} one is forced to explain an extremely simple application to.
Particularly appropriate when the suit failed to notice the `Press any key to
continue' prompt, and wishes to know `why won't it do anything'. Also seen as
`RTFS' in especially deserving cases.
