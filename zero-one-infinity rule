 :Zero-One-Infinity Rule: prov. "Allow none of {foo}, one of {foo}, or any
number of {foo}." A rule of thumb for software design, which instructs one to
not place {random} limits on the number of instances of a given entity (such
as: windows in a window system, letters in an OS's filenames, etc.).
Specifically, one should either disallow the entity entirely, allow exactly
one instance (an "exception"), or allow as many as the user wants -- address
space and memory permitting. The logic behind this rule is that there are
often situations where it makes clear sense to allow one of something instead
of none. However, if one decides to go further and allow N (for N > 1), then
why not N+1? And if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on? Once above 1, there's
no excuse not to allow any N; hence, {infinity}. Many hackers recall in this
connection Isaac Asimov's SF novel The Gods Themselves in which a character
announces that the number 2 is impossible -- if you're going to believe in
more than one universe, you might as well believe in an infinite number of
them.
