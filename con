 :con: [from SF fandom] n. A science-fiction convention. Not used of other
sorts of conventions, such as professional meetings. This term, unlike many
others of SF-fan slang, is widely recognized even by hackers who aren't
{fan}s. "We'd been corresponding on the net for months, then we met
face-to-face at a con."
