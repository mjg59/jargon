 :cursor dipped in X: n. There are a couple of metaphors in English of the
form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common values of X are `acid',
`bile', and `vitriol'). These map over neatly to this hackish usage (the
cursor being what moves, leaving letters behind, when one is composing
on-line). "Talk about a {nastygram}! He must've had his cursor dipped in acid
when he wrote that one!"
