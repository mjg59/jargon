 :sigmonster: n.[common] A beast that randomly chooses one of a selection of
signatures for appending to mail and news messages. The creature is most
often mentioned directly when it has been in particularly good form and
selected a signature appropriate to the topic being discussed; the
construction "P.S.: good sigmonster, have a cookie" is not uncommon. While
the are sigmonster programs floating around on the net, most hackers who keep
one use a silly little Perl or Python script that they threw together in the
middle of the night under the influence of far too much caffeine.
