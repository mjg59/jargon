 HOT SPOTS (hot spotz) [primarily C/UNIX programmers, but spreading] n. In
most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90% of the execution time; if
one were to graph instruction visits versus code addresses, one would
typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of low-level noise. Such spikes
are called hot spots and are good candidates for HAND-HACKING. The term is
especially used of tight loops and recursions in the code's central
algorithm, as opposed to (say) initial set-up costs or large but infrequent
I/O operations. see TUNE, BUM, HAND-HACKING.
