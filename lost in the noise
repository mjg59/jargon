 :lost in the noise: /adj./ Syn. {lost in the underflow}. This term is from
signal processing, where signals of very small amplitude cannot be separated
from low-intensity noise in the system. Though popular among hackers, it is
not confined to hackerdom; physicists, engineers, astronomers, and
statisticians all use it.
