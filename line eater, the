 :line eater, the: /n. obs./ [Usenet] 1. A bug in some now-obsolete versions
of the netnews software that used to eat up to BUFSIZ bytes of the article
text. The bug was triggered by having the text of the article start with a
space or tab. This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature called
the `line eater', and postings often included a dummy line of `line eater
food'. Ironically, line eater `food' not beginning with a space or tab wasn't
actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but if there *was* a space or tab
before it, then the line eater would eat the food *and* the beginning of the
text it was supposed to be protecting. The practice of `sacrificing to the
line eater' continued for some time after the bug had been {nailed to the
wall}, and is still humorously referred to. The bug itself was still
occasionally reported to be lurking in some mail-to-netnews gateways as late
as 1991. 2. see {NSA line eater}.
