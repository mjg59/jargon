 :snail-mail: n. Paper mail, as opposed to electronic. Sometimes written as
the single word `SnailMail'. One's postal address is, correspondingly, a
snail address. Derives from earlier coinage `USnail' (from `U.S. Mail'), for
which there have even been parody posters and stamps made. Also (less
commonly) called P-mail, from `paper mail' or `physical mail'. Oppose
{email}. (Note: Actual garden snails progress at about 10 meters per hour,
which is about 25-50 times slower than the U.K.'s Royal Mail; comparable
measurements for other countries have not yet been made. More biologically
apt terms might be "sloth-mail" at 250 m/hr or "tortoise-mail" at 270 m/hr.
