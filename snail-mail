 :snail-mail: /n./ Paper mail, as opposed to electronic. Sometimes written as
the single word `SnailMail'. One's postal address is, correspondingly, a
`snail address'. Derives from earlier coinage `USnail' (from `U.S. Mail'),
for which there have even been parody posters and stamps made. Also (less
commonly) called `P-mail', from `paper mail' or `physical mail'. Oppose
{email}.
