 :DDT: /D-D-T/ n. 1. Generic term for a program that assists in debugging
other programs by showing individual machine instructions in a readable
symbolic form and letting the user change them. In this sense the term DDT is
now archaic, having been widely displaced by `debugger' or names of
individual programs like `adb', `sdb', `dbx', or `gdb'. 2. [ITS] Under MIT's
fabled {{ITS}} operating system, DDT (running under the alias HACTRN) was
also used as the {shell} or top level command language used to execute other
programs. 3. Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early
{DEC} hardware. The DEC PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote
on the first page of the documentation for DDT that illuminates the origin of
the term: Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
computer in 1961. At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape". Since
then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has propagated throughout the
computer industry. DDT programs are now available for all DEC computers.
Since media other than tape are now frequently used, the more descriptive
name "Dynamic Debugging Technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT
abbreviation. Confusion between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (C14-H9-Cl5) should be minimal since each
attacks a different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs. (The
`tape' referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic but paper.) Sadly, this
quotation was removed from later editions of the handbook after the {suit}s
took over and DEC became much more `businesslike'. The history above is known
to many old-time hackers. But there's more: Peter Samson, compiler of the
original {TMRC} lexicon, reports that he named `DDT' after a similar tool on
the TX-0 computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1 built at MIT's Lincoln
Lab in 1957. The debugger on that ground-breaking machine (the first
transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT (FLexowriter Interrogation
Tape).
