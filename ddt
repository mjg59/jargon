 DDT /dee'dee'tee'/ n. 1. Generic term for a program that helps you to debug
other programs by showing individual machine instructions in a readable
symbolic form and letting the user change them. In this sense the term DDT is
now slightly archaic, having been widely displaced by `debugger' 2. [ITS]
Under MIT's fabled ITS operating system (q.v.), its DDT was also used as the
SHELL or top level command language used to execute other programs. 3. Any
one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early DEC hardware. The
DEC PDP-10 Reference Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page
of the documentation for DDT which illuminates the origin of the term:
Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1 computer in 1961.
At that time DDT stood for "DEC Debugging Tape". Since then, the idea of an
on-line debugging program has propagated throughout the computer industry.
DDT programs are now available for all DEC computers. Since media other than
tape are now frequently used, the more descriptive name "Dynamic Debugging
technique" has been adopted, retaining the DDT acronym. Confusion between
DDT-10 and another well known pesticide, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane
(C14-H9-Cl5) should be minimal since each attacks a different, and apparently
mutually exclusive, class of bugs. Sadly, this quotation was removed from
later editions of the handbook as DEC became much more "businesslike".
