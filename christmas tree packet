 :Christmas tree packet: n. A packet with every single option set for
whatever protocol is in use. see {kamikaze packet}, {Chernobyl packet}. (The
term doubtless derives from a fanciful image of each little option bit being
represented by a different-colored light bulb, all turned on.) Compare
{Godzillagram}.
