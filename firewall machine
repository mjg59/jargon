 :firewall machine: n. A dedicated gateway machine with special security
precautions on it, used to service outside network connections and dial-in
lines. The idea is to protect a cluster of more loosely administered machines
hidden behind it from {cracker}s. The typical firewall is an inexpensive
micro-based Unix box kept clean of critical data, with a bunch of modems and
public network ports on it but just one carefully watched connection back to
the rest of the cluster. The special precautions may include threat
monitoring, callback, and even a complete {iron box} keyable to particular
incoming IDs or activity patterns. Syn. {flytrap}, {Venus flytrap}.
