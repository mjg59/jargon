 BIT BUCKET n. The great data sink in the sky (originally, the mythical
receptacle used to catch bits when they fall off the end of a register during
a shift instruction). Data that is discarded, lost, or destroyed is said to
"go to the bit bucket". On UNIX, often used for /DEV/NULL (q.v.). Sometimes
amplified as "the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky". This term is used purely in
jest. It's based on the fanciful notion that bits are objects that are not
destroyed, but only misplaced. see also NULL DEVICE.
