 :profile: n. 1. A control file for a program, esp. a text file automatically
read from each user's home directory and intended to be easily modified by
the user in order to customize the program's behavior. Used to avoid
{hardcoded} choices (see also {dot file}, {rc file}). 2. [techspeak] A report
on the amounts of time spent in each routine of a program, used to find and
{tune} away the {hot spot}s in it. This sense is often verbed. Some profiling
modes report units other than time (such as call counts) and/or report at
granularities other than per-routine, but the idea is similar. 3.[techspeak]
A subset of a standard used for a particular purpose. This sense confuses
hackers who wander into the weird world of ISO standards no end!
