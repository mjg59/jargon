 GFR: /G-F-R/ vt. [ITS] From `Grim File Reaper', an ITS and Lisp Machine
utility. To remove a file or files according to some program-automated or
semi-automatic manual procedure, especially one designed to reclaim mass
storage space or reduce name-space clutter (the original GFR actually moved
files to tape). Often generalized to pieces of data below file level. "I used
to have his phone number, but I guess I {GFR}ed it." see also {prowler},
{reaper}. Compare {GC}, which discards only provably worthless stuff. gig:
/jig/ or /gig/ [SI] n. see {{quantifiers}}. giga-: /ji'ga/ or /gi'ga/ [SI]
pref. see {{quantifiers}}.
