 :gotcha: n. A {misfeature} of a system, especially a programming language or
environment, that tends to breed bugs or mistakes because it is both
enticingly easy to invoke and completely unexpected and/or unreasonable in
its outcome. For example, a classic gotcha in {C} is the fact that `if (a=b)
{code;}' is syntactically valid and sometimes even correct. It puts the value
of `b' into `a' and then executes `code' if `a' is non-zero. What the
programmer probably meant was `if (a==b) {code;}', which executes `code' if
`a' and `b' are equal.
