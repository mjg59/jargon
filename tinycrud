 :tinycrud: /ti:'nee-kruhd/ n. 1. A pejorative used by habitues of older
game-oriented {MUD} versions for TinyMUDs and other user-extensible {MUD}
variants; esp. common among users of the rather violent and competitive
AberMUD and MIST systems. These people justify the slur on the basis of how
(allegedly) inconsistent and lacking in genuine atmosphere the scenarios
generated in user extensible MUDs can be. Other common knocks on them are
that they feature little overall plot, bad game topology, little competitive
interaction, etc. --- not to mention the alleged horrors of the TinyMUD code
itself. This dispute is one of the MUD world's hardiest perennial {holy
wars}. 2. TinyMud-oriented chat on the USENET group rec.games.mud and
elsewhere, especially {newbie} questions and flamage.
