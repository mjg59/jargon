 :maximum Maytag mode: n. What a {washing machine} or, by extension, any disk
drive is in when it's being used so heavily that it's shaking like an old
Maytag with an unbalanced load. If prolonged for any length of time, can lead
to disks becoming {walking drives}. In 1999 it's been some years since hard
disks were large enough to do this, but the same phenomenon has recently been
reported with 24X CD-ROM drives.
