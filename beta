 :beta: /bay´t@/, /be´t@/, /bee´t@/, n. 1. Mostly working, but still under
test; usu. used with "in": in beta. In the {Real World}, hardware or software
systems often go through two stages of release testing: Alpha (in-house) and
Beta (out-house?). Beta releases are generally made to a group of lucky (or
unlucky) trusted customers. 2. Anything that is new and experimental. "His
girlfriend is in beta" means that he is still testing for compatibility and
reserving judgment. 3. Flaky; dubious; suspect (since beta software is
notoriously buggy). Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a
pre-release (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making
it available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users. This term
derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first
used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry. Alpha Test was the
unit, module, or component test phase; Beta Test was initial system test.
These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for hardware. The A-test
was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done before any commitment
to design and development. The B-test was a demonstration that the
engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test (corresponding to
today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of the production
design, and the D test was the C test repeated after the model had been in
production a while.
