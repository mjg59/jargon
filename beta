 :beta: /bay't*/, /be't*/ or (Commonwealth) /bee't*/ n. 1. In the {Real
World}, software often goes through two stages of testing: Alpha (in-house)
and Beta (out-house?). Software is said to be `in beta'. 2. Anything that is
new and experimental is in beta. "His girlfriend is in beta" means that he is
still testing for compatibility and reserving judgment. 3. Beta software is
notoriously buggy, so `in beta' connotes flakiness. Historical note: More
formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release (potentially unreliable)
version of a piece of software by making it available to selected customers
and users. This term derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle
checkpoints, first used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry.
`Alpha Test' was the unit, module, or component test phase; `Beta Test' was
initial system test. These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for
hardware. The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation done
before any commitment to design and development. The B-test was a
demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified. The C-test
(corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early samples of
the production design.
