 :w00t: An interjection similar to "Yay!", as in: "w00t!!! I just got a
raise!" Some claim this is a bastardization of "root", the highest level of
access to a system (particularly UNIX), originated by script kiddies as a
133tspeak equivalent of "root", and said as an exclamation upon gaining root
access. Others claim it originated in the Everquest multiplayer game as an
abbreviation of "wonderful loot". Adj. `w00table' has the sense of "cool" or
"nifty". This is one of the few leet-speak coinages to have crossed over into
non-ironic use among hackers.
