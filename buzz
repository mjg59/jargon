 BUZZ vi. 1. Of a program, to run with no indication of progress and perhaps
without guarantee of ever finishing; esp. said of programs thought to be
executing tight loops of code. The state of a buzzing program resembles
CATATONIA, but you never get out of catatonia, while a buzzing loop may
eventually end of its own accord. Example: "The program buzzes for about ten
seconds trying to sort all the names into order." see SPIN. 2. [ETA Systems]
To test a wire or PCB trace for continuity by applying an AC signal as
opposed to applying a DC signal. Some wire faults will pass DC tests but fail
a BUZZ test.
