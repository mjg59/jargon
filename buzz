 :buzz: /vi./ 1. Of a program, to run with no indication of progress and
perhaps without guarantee of ever finishing; esp. said of programs thought to
be executing tight loops of code. A program that is buzzing appears to be
{catatonic}, but never gets out of catatonia, while a buzzing loop may
eventually end of its own accord. "The program buzzes for about 10 seconds
trying to sort all the names into order." see {spin}; see also {grovel}. 2.
[ETA Systems] To test a wire or printed circuit trace for continuity by
applying an AC rather than DC signal. Some wire faults will pass DC tests but
fail a buzz test. 3. To process an array or list in sequence, doing the same
thing to each element. "This loop buzzes through the tz array looking for a
terminator type."
