 :fritterware: /n./ An excess of capability that serves no productive end.
The canonical example is font-diddling software on the Mac (see {macdink});
the term describes anything that eats huge amounts of time for quite marginal
gains in function but seduces people into using it anyway. see also {window
shopping}.
