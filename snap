 :snap: v. To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct pointer; to
replace an old address with the forwarding address found there. If you
telephone the main number for an institution and ask for a particular person
by name, the operator may tell you that person's extension before connecting
you, in the hopes that you will `snap your pointer' and dial direct next
time. The underlying metaphor may be that of a rubber band stretched through
a number of intermediate points; if you remove all the thumbtacks in the
middle, it snaps into a straight line from first to last. see {chase
pointers}. Often, the behavior of a {trampoline} is to perform an error check
once and then snap the pointer that invoked it so as henceforth to bypass the
trampoline (and its one-shot error check). In this context one also speaks of
`snapping links'. For example, in a LISP implementation, a function interface
trampoline might check to make sure that the caller is passing the correct
number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee are both
compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path to use a direct
procedure-call instruction with no further overhead.
