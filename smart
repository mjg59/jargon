 SMART (smart) adj. Said of a program that does the RIGHT THING (q.v.) in a
wide variety of complicated circumstances. There is a difference between
calling a program smart and calling it intelligent; in particular, there do
not exist any intelligent programs (yet). Compare ROBUST (smart programs can
be BRITTLE).
