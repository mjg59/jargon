 :religious issues: n. Questions which seemingly cannot be raised without
touching off {holy wars}, such as "What is the best operating system (or
editor, language, architecture, shell, mail reader, news reader)?", "What
about that Heinlein guy, eh?", "What should we add to the new Jargon File?"
see {holy wars}; see also {theology}, {bigot}. This term is a prime example
of {ha ha only serious}. People actually develop the most amazing and
religiously intense attachments to their tools, even when the tools are
intangible. The most constructive thing one can do when one stumbles into the
crossfire is mumble {Get a life!} and leave -- unless, of course, one's *own*
unassailably rational and obviously correct choices are being slammed.
