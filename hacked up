 :hacked up: adj. Sufficiently patched, kluged, and tweaked that the surgical
scars are beginning to crowd out normal tissue (compare {critical mass}). Not
all programs that are hacked become `hacked up'; if modifications are done
with some eye to coherence and continued maintainability, the software may
emerge better for the experience. Contrast {hack up}.
