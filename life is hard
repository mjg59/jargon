 :Life is hard: prov. [XEROX PARC] This phrase has two possible
interpretations: (1) "While your suggestion may have some merit, I will
behave as though I hadn't heard it." (2) "While your suggestion has obvious
merit, equally obvious circumstances prevent it from being seriously
considered." The charm of the phrase lies precisely in this subtle but
important ambiguity.
