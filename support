 :support: n. After-sale handholding; something many software vendors promise
but few deliver. To hackers, most support people are useless --- because by
the time a hacker calls support he or she will usually know the relevant
manuals better than the support people (sadly, this is *not* a joke or
exaggeration). A hacker's idea of `support' is a t^ete-`a-t^ete with the
software's designer.
