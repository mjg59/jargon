 :support: n. After-sale handholding; something many software vendors promise
but few deliver. To hackers, most support people are useless -- because by
the time a hacker calls support he or she will usually know the software and
the relevant manuals better than the support people (sadly, this is _not_ a
joke or exaggeration). A hacker's idea of `support' is a te^te-a`-te^te with
the software's designer.
