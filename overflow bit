 :overflow bit: n. 1. [techspeak] On some processors, an attempt to calculate
a result too large for a register to hold causes a particular {flag} called
an {overflow bit} to be set. 2. Hackers use the term of human thought too.
"Well, the {{Ada}} description was {baroque} all right, but I could hack it
OK until they got to the exception handling ... that set my overflow bit." 3.
The hypothetical bit that will be set if a hacker doesn't get to make a trip
to the Room of Porcelain Fixtures: "I'd better process an internal interrupt
before the overflow bit gets set".
