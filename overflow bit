 :overflow bit: n. 1. [techspeak] A {flag} on some processors indicating an
attempt to calculate a result too large for a register to hold. 2. More
generally, an indication of any kind of capacity overload condition. "Well,
the Ada description was {baroque} all right, but I could hack it OK until
they got to the exception handling ... that set my overflow bit." 3. The
hypothetical bit that will be set if a hacker doesn't get to make a trip to
the Room of Porcelain Fixtures: "I'd better process an internal interrupt
before the overflow bit gets set." [73-07-24.png] Crunchly and the {overflow
