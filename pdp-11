 :PDP-11: Possibly the single most successful minicomputer design in history,
a favorite of hackers for many years, and the first major Unix machine, The
first PDP-11s (the 11/15 and 11/20) shipped in 1970 from {DEC}; the last
(11/93 and 11/94) in 1990. Along the way, the 11 gave birth to the {VAX},
strongly influenced the design of microprocessors such as the Motorola 6800
and Intel 386, and left a permanent imprint on the C language (which has an
odd preference for octal embedded in its syntax because of the way PDP-11
machine instructions were formatted). There is a history site.
