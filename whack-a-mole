 :whack-a-mole: n. [from the carnival game which involves quickly and
repeatedly hitting the heads of mechanical moles with a mallet as they pop up
from their holes.] 1. The practice of repeatedly causing spammers' {throwaway
account}s and drop boxes to be terminated. 2. After sense 1 became
established in the mid-1990s the term passed into more generalized use, and
now is commonly found in such combinations as `whack-a-mole windows'; the
obnoxious pop-up advertisement windows spawned in flocks when you surf to
sites like Angelfire or Lycos.
