 :glark: /glark/ vt. To figure something out from context. "The System III
manuals are pretty poor, but you can generally glark the meaning from
context." Interestingly, the word was originally `glork'; the context was
"This gubblick contains many nonsklarkish English flutzpahs, but the overall
pluggandisp can be glorked [sic] from context" (David Moser, quoted by
Douglas Hofstadter in his "Metamagical Themas" column in the January 1981
"Scientific American"). It is conjectured that hacker usage mutated the verb
to `glark' because {glork} was already an established jargon term (some
hackers do report using the original term). Compare {grok}, {zen}.
