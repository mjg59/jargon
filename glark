 GLARK /glark/ vt. To figure something out from context, taken from an old
Scientific American "Mathematical Games" column. "The System III manuals are
pretty poor, but you can generally glark the meaning from context".
Interestingly, the original sentence was "This gubblick contains many
nonsklarkish English flutzpahs, but the overall pluggandisp can be glorked
[sic] from context." by David Moser, quoted by Douglas Hofstadter in his
"Metamagical Themas" column in the January 1981 Scientific American. It is
conjectured that hackish usage mutated the verb to `glark' because GLORK
(q.v.) was already an established jargon term.
