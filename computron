 COMPUTRON (kom-pyoo-tron) n. A notional unit of computing power combining
instruction speed and storage capacity, dimensioned roughly in
instructions-per-sec times megabytes-of-main-store times
megabytes-of-mass-storage. "That machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have
enough computrons!" This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat
computing power as a fungible commodity good like a crop yield or diesel
horsepower. see BITTY BOX, GET A REAL COMPUTER, TOY, CRANK.
