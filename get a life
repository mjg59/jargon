 GET A LIFE! imp. Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the person to whom
you are speaking has succumbed to terminal geekdom (see COMPUTER GEEK). Often
heard on USENET. It is alleged that this exhortation was originally uttered
by William Shatner to a crowd of eager trekkies in a speach which ended "Get
a job! Get a *life*!".
