 :BOFH: // n. [common] Acronym, Bastard Operator From Hell. A system
administrator with absolutely no tolerance for {luser}s. "You say you need
more filespace? <massive-global-delete> seems to me you have plenty left..."
Many BOFHs (and others who would be BOFHs if they could get away with it)
hang out in the newsgroup alt.sysadmin.recovery, although there has also been
created a top-level newsgroup hierarchy (bofh.*) of their own. Several people
have written stories about BOFHs. The set usually considered canonical is by
Simon Travaglia and may be found at the Bastard Home Page
(http://bofh.ntk.net/Bastard.html). BOFHs and BOFH wannabes hang out on
{scary devil monastery} and wield {LART}s.
