 :BOFH: /n./ Acronym, Bastard Operator From Hell. A system administrator with
absolutely no tolerance for {luser}s. "You say you need more filespace?
<massive-global-delete> seems to me you have plenty left..." Many BOFHs (and
others who would be BOFHs if they could get away with it) hang out in the
newsgroup alt.sysadmin.recovery, although they collectively created a
top-level newsgroup hierarchy (bofh.*) of their own.
