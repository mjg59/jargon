 :code grinder: n. 1. A {suit}-wearing minion of the sort hired in legion
strength by banks and insurance companies to implement payroll packages in
RPG and other such unspeakable horrors. In its native habitat, the code
grinder often removes the suit jacket to reveal an underplumage consisting of
button-down shirt (starch optional) and a tie. In times of dire stress, the
sleeves (if long) may be rolled up and the tie loosened about half an inch.
It seldom helps. The {code grinder}'s milieu is about as far from hackerdom
as one can get and still touch a computer; the term connotes pity. see {Real
World}, {suit}. 2. Used of or to a hacker, a really serious slur on the
person's creative ability; connotes a design style characterized by primitive
technique, rule-boundedness, {brute force}, and utter lack of imagination.
Compare {card walloper}; contrast {hacker}, {Real Programmer}.
