 :blivet: /bliv'*t/ /n./ [allegedly from a World War II military term meaning
"ten pounds of manure in a five-pound bag"] 1. An intractable problem. 2. A
crucial piece of hardware that can't be fixed or replaced if it breaks. 3. A
tool that has been hacked over by so many incompetent programmers that it has
become an unmaintainable tissue of hacks. 4. An out-of-control but unkillable
development effort. 5. An embarrassing bug that pops up during a customer
demo. 6. In the subjargon of computer security specialists, a
denial-of-service attack performed by hogging limited resources that have no
access controls (for example, shared spool space on a multi-user system).
This term has other meanings in other technical cultures; among experimental
physicists and hardware engineers of various kinds it seems to mean any
random object of unknown purpose (similar to hackish use of {frob}). It has
also been used to describe an amusing trick-the-eye drawing resembling a
three-pronged fork that appears to depict a three-dimensional object until
one realizes that the parts fit together in an impossible way.
