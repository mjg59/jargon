 :Unix brain damage: n. Something that has to be done to break a network
program (typically a mailer) on a non-Unix system so that it will
interoperate with Unix systems. The hack may qualify as Unix brain damage if
the program conforms to published standards and the Unix program in question
does not. Unix brain damage happens because it is much easier for other
(minority) systems to change their ways to match non-conforming behavior than
it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of Unix systems out there. An
example of Unix brain damage is a {kluge} in a mail server to recognize bare
line feed (the Unix newline) as an equivalent form to the Internet standard
newline, which is a carriage return followed by a line feed. Such things can
make even a hardened {jock} weep.
