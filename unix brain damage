 :UNIX brain damage: n. Something that has to be done to break a network
program (typically a mailer) on a non-UNIX system so that it will
interoperate with UNIX systems. The hack may qualify as `UNIX brain damage'
if the program conforms to published standards and the UNIX program in
question does not. UNIX brain damage happens because it is much easier for
other (minority) systems to change their ways to match non-conforming
behavior than it is to change all the hundreds of thousands of UNIX systems
out there. An example of UNIX brain damage is a {kluge} in a mail server to
recognize bare line feed (the UNIX newline) as an equivalent form to the
Internet standard newline, which is a carriage return followed by a line
feed. Such things can make even a hardened {jock} weep.
