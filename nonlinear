 :nonlinear: adj. [scientific computation] 1. Behaving in an erratic and
unpredictable fashion; unstable. When used to describe the behavior of a
machine or program, it suggests that said machine or program is being forced
to run far outside of design specifications. This behavior may be induced by
unreasonable inputs, or may be triggered when a more mundane bug sends the
computation far off from its expected course. 2. When describing the behavior
of a person, suggests a tantrum or a {flame}. "When you talk to Bob, don't
mention the drug problem or he'll go nonlinear for hours." In this context,
`go nonlinear' connotes `blow up out of proportion' (proportion connotes
linearity).
