 :Church of the SubGenius: n. A mutant offshoot of {Discordianism} launched
in 1981 as a spoof of fundamentalist Christianity by the `Reverend' Ivan
Stang, a brilliant satirist with a gift for promotion. Popular among hackers
as a rich source of bizarre imagery and references such as "Bob" the divine
drilling-equipment salesman, the Benevolent Space Xists, and the Stark Fist
of Removal. Much SubGenius theory is concerned with the acquisition of the
mystical substance or quality of {slack}. There is a home page at
