 GREEN LIGHTNING [IBM] n. Apparently random flashing streaks on the face of
3278-9 terminals while a programmable symbol set is being loaded. This
hardware bug was left deliberately unfixed, as some bright spark suggested
that this would let the user know that `something is happening'. It certainly
does. 2. [generalization of #1 proposed by ESR] Any bug perverted into an
alleged feature by adroit rationalization or marketing. E.g. "Motorola calls
the CISC cruft in the 8800 architecture `compatibility logic', but I call it
green lightning".
