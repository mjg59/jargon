 :green lightning: n. [IBM] 1. Apparently random flashing streaks on the face
of 3278-9 terminals while a new symbol set is being downloaded. This hardware
bug was left deliberately unfixed, as some genius within IBM suggested it
would let the user know that `something is happening'. That, it certainly
does. Later microprocessor-driven IBM color graphics displays were actually
*programmed* to produce green lightning! 2. [proposed] Any bug perverted into
an alleged feature by adroit rationalization or marketing. "Motorola calls
the CISC cruft in the 88000 architecture `compatibility logic', but I call it
green lightning". see also {feature} (sense 6).
