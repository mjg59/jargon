 :interrupt: 1. [techspeak] /n./ On a computer, an event that interrupts
normal processing and temporarily diverts flow-of-control through an
"interrupt handler" routine. see also {trap}. 2. /interj./ A request for
attention from a hacker. Often explicitly spoken. "Interrupt -- have you seen
Joe recently?" see {priority interrupt}. 3. Under MS-DOS, nearly synonymous
with `system call', because the OS and BIOS routines are both called using
the INT instruction (see {{interrupt list, the}}) and because programmers so
often have to bypass the OS (going directly to a BIOS interrupt) to get
reasonable performance.
