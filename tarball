 :tarball: n. [very common; prob. based on the "tar baby" in the Uncle Remus
folk tales] An archive, created with the Unix tar(1) utility, containing
myriad related files. "Here, I'll just ftp you a tarball of the whole
project." Tarballs have been the standard way to ship around source-code
distributions since the mid-1980s; in retrospect it seems odd that this term
did not enter common usage until the late 1990s.
