 120 reset: [from 120 volts, U.S. wall current] n. To cycle power on a
machine in order to reset or unjam it. Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power
cycle}. 2: infix. In translation software written by hackers, infix 2 often
represents the syllable *to* with the connotation `translate to'; as in
dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string (integer to string) and texi2roff
(Texinfo to [nt]roff). @-party: /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet
address] n. (also `@-sign party' /at'sien par`tee/) Semi-closed parties
thrown at science-fiction conventions (esp. the annual Worldcon) for hackers;
one must have a {network address} to get in, or at least be in company with
someone who does. One of the most reliable opportunities for hackers to meet
face to face with people who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor
dots on their screens. Compare {boink}. @Begin: // [primarily CMU] n.
Equivalent of {\begin} in the Scribe text formatting language; used as an
idiom by Scribe users. \begin: // [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used
humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the surrounded
text. For example: \begin{flame} Predicate logic is the only good programming
language. Anyone who would use anything else is an idiot. Also, computers
should be tredecimal instead of binary. \end{flame} The Scribe users at CMU
and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in an identical way. On USENET, this
construct would more frequently be rendered as "<FLAME ON>" and "<FLAME
OFF>". = A = ===== abbrev: /*'breev/, /*'brev/ n. Common abbreviation for
`abbreviation'. abend: [ABnormal END] /ab'end/ n. Abnormal termination (of
software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360;
used jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by {code grinder}s.
accumulator: n. Archaic term for a register. Cited here because on-line use
of it is a fairly reliable indication that the user has been around for quite
a while and/or that the architecture under discussion is quite old. The term
in full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example, though
symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A' derive from
historical use of `accumulator' (and not, actually, from `arithmetic'!).
Confusingly, though, an `a' register name prefix may also stand for
`address', as for example on the Motorola 680x0 family. ACK: /ak/ interj. 1.
[from the ASCII mnemonic for #b0000110] Acknowledge. Used to register one's
presence (compare mainstream *Yo!*). An appropriate response to {ping} or
{ENQ}. 2. [prob. from the Bloom County comic strip] An exclamation of
surprised disgust, esp. in "Oop ack!". Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is
distinguished by a following exclamation point. 3. Used to politely interrupt
someone to tell them you understand their point. see {NAK}. Thus, for
example, you might cut off an overly long explanation with "Ack. Ack. Ack. I
get it now". see also {NAK}. There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense #1)
meaning "Are you there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced
no reply, or during a lull in {talk mode} to see if the person has gone away
(the standard humorous response is of course {NAK} (sense #2), i.e., "I'm not
here"). ad-hockery: /ad-hok'*r-ee/ [Purdue] n. 1. Gratuitous assumptions made
inside certain programs, esp. expert systems, which lead to the appearance of
semi-intelligent behavior, but are in fact entirely arbitrary. 2.
Special-case code to cope with some awkward input which would otherwise cause
a program to {choke}, presuming normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner
and more regular way. Also called `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/).
Ada:: n. A {{Pascal}}-descended language that has been made mandatory for
Department of Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers are nearly
unanimous in observing that, technically, it is precisely what one might
expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee,
crockish, difficult to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar
boondoggle (one common description is "The PL/I of the 1980s"). Hackers find
Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication features
particularly hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became
the world's first programmer while cooperating with Babbage on the design of
his mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly
blanch at the use her name has been latterly put to; the kindest thing that
has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language
screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk. adger: /adj'r/
[UCLA] vt. To make a bonehead move with consequences that could have been
foreseen with a slight amount of mental effort. E.g., "He started removing
files and promptly adgered the whole project." Compare {dumbass attack}.
admin: /ad-min'/ n. Short for `administrator'; very commonly used in speech
or on-line to refer to the systems person in charge on a computer. Common
constructions on this include `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the
administrator's role as a site contact for email and news) or `newsadmin'
(focusing on the latter). Compare {postmaster}, {sysop}, {system mangler}.
