 ACK /ak/ interj. 1. [from the ASCII mnemonic for 00110] Acknowledge. Used to
register one's presence (compare mainstream "Yo!"). An appropriate response
to PING or ENQ (q.v.). 2. [prob. from _Bloom_County_] An exclamation of
surprised disgust, esp. in "Oop ack!". Semi-humorous. Also in the form ACK?
meaning "Are you there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced
no reply, or during a lull in TALK MODE to see if the person has gone away
(the standard humorous response is of course NAK (010101), i.e. "I'm not
here").
