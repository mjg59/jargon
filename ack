 :ACK: /ak/ interj. 1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
Acknowledge. Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream _Yo!_). An
appropriate response to {ping} or {ENQ}. 2. [from the comic strip "Bloom
County"] An exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"
Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is
distinguished by a following exclamation point. 3. Used to politely interrupt
someone to tell them you understand their point (see {NAK}). Thus, for
example, you might cut off an overly long explanation with "Ack. Ack. Ack. I
get it now". 4. An affirmative. "Think we ought to ditch that damn NT server
for a Linux box?" "ACK!" There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning
"Are you there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
reply, or during a lull in {talk mode} to see if the person has gone away
(the standard humorous response is of course {NAK} (sense 1), i.e., "I'm not
here").
