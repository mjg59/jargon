 ACK: /ak/ interj. 1. [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110] Acknowledge. Used
to register one's presence (compare mainstream *Yo!*). An appropriate
response to {ping} or {ENQ}. 2. [from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An
exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!" Semi-humorous.
Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is distinguished by a
following exclamation point. 3. Used to politely interrupt someone to tell
them you understand their point (see {NAK}). Thus, for example, you might cut
off an overly long explanation with "Ack. Ack. Ack. I get it now". There is
also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you there?", often used in
email when earlier mail has produced no reply, or during a lull in {talk
mode} to see if the person has gone away (the standard humorous response is
of course {NAK} (sense 2), i.e., "I'm not here"). ad-hockery: /ad-hok'*r-ee/
[Purdue] n. 1. Gratuitous assumptions made inside certain programs, esp.
expert systems, which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but
are in fact entirely arbitrary. For example, fuzzy-matching input tokens that
might be typing errors against a symbol table can make it look as though a
program knows how to spell. 2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward
input that would otherwise cause a program to {choke}, presuming normal
inputs are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way. Also called
`ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/). see also {ELIZA effect}. Ada:: n.
A {{Pascal}}-descended language that has been made mandatory for Department
of Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers are nearly unanimous in
observing that, technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that
kind of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult to
use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle (one common
description is "The PL/I of the 1980s"). Hackers find Ada's
exception-handling and inter-process communication features particularly
hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became the world's
first programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his
mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest thing that
has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language
screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk. adger: /aj'r/
[UCLA] vt. To make a bonehead move with consequences that could have been
foreseen with a slight amount of mental effort. E.g., "He started removing
files and promptly adgered the whole project". Compare {dumbass attack}.
admin: /ad-min'/ n. Short for `administrator'; very commonly used in speech
or on-line to refer to the systems person in charge on a computer. Common
constructions on this include `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the
administrator's role as a site contact for email and news) or `newsadmin'
(focusing specifically on news). Compare {postmaster}, {sysop}, {system
mangler}.
