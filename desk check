 :desk check: n.,v. To {grovel} over hardcopy of source code, mentally
simulating the control flow; a method of catching bugs. No longer common
practice in this age of on-screen editing, fast compiles, and sophisticated
debuggers --- though some maintain stoutly that it ought to be. Compare
{eyeball search}, {vdiff}, {vgrep}.
