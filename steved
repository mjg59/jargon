 :steved: adj.,v., /steevd/ [Apple employees and users] Terminated, said of a
development project. Originated after Steven P. Jobs returned to Apple as
acting CEO in 1997. Jobs immediated axed several development projects,
including OpenDoc and Newton that had been launched by John Sculley, the man
who had ousted Jobs in the mid 1980s. Now any project shut down at Apple and
often at any large firm connected with Apple may be said to have gotten
steved. It is usually spelled lowercase despite the origin. It is almost
always past-tense and used quasi-adjectivally.
