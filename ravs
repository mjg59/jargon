 :ravs: /ravz/, also `Chinese ravs' n. Jiao-zi (steamed or boiled) or Guo-tie
(pan-fried). A Chinese appetizer, known variously in the plural as dumplings,
pot stickers (the literal translation of guo-tie), and (around Boston)
`Peking Ravioli'. The term `rav' is short for `ravioli', and among hackers
always means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind. Both consist of a
filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind includes no cheese, uses a
thinner pasta, has a pork-vegetable filling (good ones include Chinese
chives), and is cooked differently, either by steaming or frying. A rav or
dumpling can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the fried kind (so
called because it sticks to the frying pot and has to be scraped off). "Let's
get hot-and-sour soup and three orders of ravs." see also {{oriental food}}.
