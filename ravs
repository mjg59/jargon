 RAVS /ravz/, also CHINESE RAVS n. Kuo-teh. A Chinese appetizer, known
variously in the plural as dumplings, potstickers and (around Boston) `Peking
Ravioli'. The term "rav" is short for "ravioli", which among hackers always
means the Chinese kind rather than the Italian kind. Both consist of a
filling in a pasta shell, but the Chinese kind uses a thinner pasta and is
cooked differently, either by steaming or frying. A rav or dumpling can be
steamed or fried, but a potsticker is always the fried kind (so called
because it sticks to the frying pot and has to be scraped off). "Let's get
hot-and-sour soup and three orders of ravs." see also ORIENTAL FOOD.
