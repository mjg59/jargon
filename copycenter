 :copycenter: n. [play on `copyright' and `copyleft'] 1. The copyright notice
carried by the various flavors of freeware BSD. According to Kirk McKusick at
BSDCon 1999: "The way it was characterized politically, you had copyright,
which is what the big companies use to lock everything up; you had copyleft,
which is free software's way of making sure they can't lock it up; and then
Berkeley had what we called `copycenter', which is `take it down to the copy
center and make as many copies as you want'".
