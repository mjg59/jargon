 JEDR: n. Synonymous with {IYFEG}. At one time, the rec.humor.funny newsgroup
on USENET tended to use `JEDR' instead of {IYFEG} or `<ethnic>'; this stemmed
from a nearly successful attempt to kill the group once made by a loser with
initials JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there (the
practice was {retcon}ned by the expanding these initials as `Joke
Ethnic/Denomination/Race'). After much sound and fury JEDR faded away; this
term appears to be doing likewise.
