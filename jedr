 :JEDR: // n. Synonymous with {IYFEG}. At one time, people in the USENET
newsgroup rec.humor.funny tended to use `JEDR' instead of {IYFEG} or
`<ethnic>'; this stemmed from a public attempt to suppress the group once
made by a loser with initials JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke
posted there. (The practice was {retcon}ned by the expanding these initials
as `Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race'.) After much sound and fury JEDR faded
away; this term appears to be doing likewise. JEDR's only permanent effect on
the net.culture was to discredit `sensitivity' arguments for censorship so
thoroughly that more recent attempts to raise them have met with immediate
and near-universal rejection.
