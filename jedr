 JEDR: n. Synonymous with {IFYEG}. The rec.humor.funny newsgroup on USENET
tends to use JEDR (Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race) instead of <IYFEG>; this
stems from a nearly successful attempt to kill the group once made by a loser
with the initials JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there.
