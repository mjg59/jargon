 :demo: /de'moh/ [short for `demonstration'] 1. v. To demonstrate a product
or prototype. A far more effective way of inducing bugs to manifest than any
number of {test} runs, especially when important people are watching. 2. n.
The act of demoing. "I've gotta give a demo of the drool-proof interface; how
does it work again?" 3. n. Esp. as `demo version', can refer either to an
early, barely-functional version of a program which can be used for
demonstration purposes as long as the operator uses *exactly* the right
commands and skirts its numerous bugs, deficiencies, and unimplemented
portions, or to a special version of a program (frequently with some features
crippled) which is distributed at little or no cost to the user for
enticement purposes.
