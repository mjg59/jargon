 120 reset: [from 120 volts, U.S. wall current] n. To cycle power on a
machine in order to reset or unjam it. Compare {Big Red Switch}, {power
cycle}. 2: infix. In translation software written by hackers, infix 2 often
represents the syllable *to* with the connotation `translate to'; as in
dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string (integer to string) and texi2roff
(Texinfo to [nt]roff). @-party: /at'par`tee/ [from the @-sign in an Internet
address] n. (also `@-sign party' /at'sien par`tee/) Semi-closed parties
thrown at science-fiction conventions (esp. the annual Worldcon) for hackers;
one must have a {network address} to get in, or at least be in company with
someone who does. One of the most reliable opportunities for hackers to meet
face to face with people who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor
dots on their screens. Compare {boink}. @Begin: // [primarily CMU] n.
Equivalent of {\begin} in the Scribe text formatting language; used as an
idiom by Scribe users. \begin: // [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used
humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the surrounded
text. For example: \begin{flame} Predicate logic is the only good programming
language. Anyone who would use anything else is an idiot. Also, computers
should be tredecimal instead of binary. \end{flame} The Scribe users at CMU
and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in an identical way. On USENET, this
construct would more frequently be rendered as "<FLAME ON>" and "<FLAME
OFF>". = A = ===== abbrev: /*'breev/, /*'brev/ n. Common abbreviation for
`abbreviation'. ABEND: [ABnormal END] /ab'end/ n. Abnormal termination (of
software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360;
used jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually
capitalized, but may appear as `abend'. Hackers will try to persuade you that
ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system operators do to the machine
late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German
`Abend' == `Evening'. accumulator: n. 1. Archaic term for a register. Cited
here because on-line use of it is as a synonym for `register' a fairly
reliable indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
that the architecture under discussion is quite old. The term in full is
almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example, though symbolic
names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A' derive from historical use of
the term `accumulator' (and not, actually, from `arithmetic'!). Confusingly,
though, an `a' register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for
example on the Motorola 680x0 family. 2. A register being used for arithmetic
or logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index). This use is in context
of a particular routine or stretch of code. "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an
accumulator."
