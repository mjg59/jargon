Yale University Some other etymology abbreviations such as {UNIX} and
{PDP-10} refer to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems,
processors, or other environments. The fact that a term is labelled with any
one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use is confined to
that culture. In particular, many terms labelled `MIT' and `Stanford' are in
quite general use. We have tried to give some indication of the distribution
of speakers in the usage notes; however, a number of factors mentioned in the
introduction conspire to make these indications less definite than might be
desirable. A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed].
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or USENET respondents
in the process of commenting on previous definitions of those entries. These
are *not* represented as established jargon. Format For New Entries
====================== All contributions and suggestions about the Jargon
File will be considered donations to be placed in the public domain as part
of this File, and may be used in subsequent paper editions. Submissions may
be edited for accuracy, clarity and concision. Try to conform to the format
already being used --- head-words separated from text by a colon (double
colon for topic entries), cross-references in curly brackets (doubled for
topic entries), pronunciations in slashes, etymologies in square brackets,
single-space after definition numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the
standard ASCII character set (7-bit printable, no high-half characters or
[nt]roff/TeX/Scribe escapes), as one of the versions generated from the
master file is an info document that has to be viewable on a character tty.
We are looking to expand the file's range of technical specialties covered.
There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the scientific
computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in numerical
analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language design, and many
other related fields. Send us your jargon! We are *not* interested in
straight technical terms explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries
unless an entry illuminates `underground' meanings or aspects not covered by
official histories. We are also not interested in `joke' entries --- there is
a lot of humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations
of what hackers do and how they think. It is OK to submit items of jargon you
have originated if they have spread to the point of being used by people who
are not personally acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by
independent submission from two different sites. The Jargon File will be
regularly maintained and re-posted from now on and will include a version
number. Read it, pass it around, contribute --- this is *your* monument! The
Jargon Lexicon ****************** = A = ===== abbrev: /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/
n. Common abbreviation for `abbreviation'. ABEND: [ABnormal END] /ah'bend/,
/*-bend'/ n. Abnormal termination (of software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives
from an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but seriously
mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually capitalized, but may appear as `abend'.
Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is called `abend' because it is
what system operators do to the machine late on Friday when they want to call
it a day, and hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'. accumulator: n.
1. Archaic term for a register. On-line use of it as a synonym for `register'
is a fairly reliable indication that the user has been around for quite a
while and/or that the architecture under discussion is quite old. The term in
full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example, though
symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A' derive from
historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not, actually, from
`arithmetic'). Confusingly, though, an `A' register name prefix may also
stand for `address', as for example on the Motorola 680x0 family. 2. A
register being used for arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing or a
loop index), especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count of many
items. This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch of code.
"The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator." 3. One's in-basket (esp.
among old-timers who might use sense 1). "You want this reviewed? Sure, just
put it in the accumulator." (see {stack}.)
