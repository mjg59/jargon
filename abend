 :ABEND: /o'bend/, /*-bend'/ n. [ABnormal END] Abnormal termination (of
software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360;
used jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually
capitalized, but may appear as `abend'. Hackers will try to persuade you that
ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system operators do to the machine
late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German
`Abend' = `Evening'.
