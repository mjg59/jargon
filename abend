 :ABEND: /a´bend/, /@·bend´/, n. [ABnormal END] 1. Abnormal termination (of
software); {crash}; {lossage}. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360;
used jokingly by hackers but seriously mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually
capitalized, but may appear as `abend'. Hackers will try to persuade you that
ABEND is called abend because it is what system operators do to the machine
late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German
Abend = `Evening'. 2. [alt.callahans] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation --
used in the subject lines of postings warning friends of an imminent loss of
Internet access. (This can be because of computer downtime, loss of provider,
moving or illness.) Variants of this also appear: ABVND = `Absent By
Voluntary Net Deprivation' and ABSEND = `Absent By Self-Enforced Net
Deprivation' have been sighted.
