 :-oid: [from `android'] suff. 1. Used as in mainstream English to indicate a
poor imitation, a counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.
Hackers will happily use it with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that
wouldn't keep company with it in mainstream English. For example, "He's a
nerdoid" means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't make the
grade; a `modemoid' might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems run at 9600 or up);
a `computeroid' might be any {bitty box}. The word `keyboid' could be used to
describe a {chiclet keyboard}, but would have to be written; spoken, it would
confuse the listener as to the speaker's city of origin. 2. More
specifically, an indicator for `resembling an android' which in the past has
been confined to science-fiction fans and hackers. It too has recently (in
1991) started to go mainstream (most notably in the term `trendoid' for
victims of terminal hipness). This is probably traceable to the
popularization of the term {droid} in "Star Wars" and its sequels. Coinages
in both forms have been common in science fiction for at least fifty years,
and hackers (who are often SF fans) have probably been making `-oid' jargon
for almost that long [though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they
were already common in the mid-1970s --- ESR].
