 XXX: /eks-eks-eks/ n. A marker that attention is needed. Commonly used in
program comments to indicate areas that are kluged up or need to be. Some
hackers liken XXX code to pornographic movies that contain the symbol. xyzzy:
/eks-wie-zee-zee-wie/, /ik-zi'zee/, /eks-wie-ziz'ee/, /zi'zee/; in
Commonwealth hackish, /eks-wie-zed-zed-wie/. [from the ADVENT game] adj. The
{canonical} `magic word'. This comes from {ADVENT}, in which the idea is to
explore an underground cave with many rooms to collect treasure. If you type
`xyzzy' at the appropriate time, you can move instantly between two otherwise
distant points. If, therefore, you encounter some bit of {magic}, you might
remark on this quite succinctly by saying simply "Xyzzy!" Example:
"Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected it,
but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you do it anyway."
"Xyzzy!" Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command
on several OSs; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
respond "Nothing happens", just as {ADVENT} did if the magic was invoked at
the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the
word. see also {plugh}. = Y = =====
