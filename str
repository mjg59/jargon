 :STR: Spot the reference. Used in {scary devil monastery} to mark the
witticism one just uttered as a quote from some work of art or literature,
the more obscure the better. Those who know where the reference comes from
reply in the form "You are $CHARACTER, and you owe me $ITEM", where
$CHARACTER is a character from the story being referenced and $ITEM is
something associated with that character. This acronym is never actually
expanded to its proper meaning in the newsgroup; posters instead use obscure
expansions, the most common being "slurp the robot", leading to comments like
"I pulled my hair out, but couldn't figure out which robot you're slurping".
