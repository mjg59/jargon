 PSEUDOPRIME n. A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with one
point missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from a mathematical
method which, rather than determining precisely whether a number is prime
(has no divisors), uses a statistical technique to decide whether the number
is "probably" prime. A number that passes this test is called a pseudoprime.
The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that pseudoprime is almost as
good as a prime: it does the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that
probably won't happen.
