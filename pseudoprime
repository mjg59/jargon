 :pseudoprime: n. A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with
one point missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from a mathematical
method that, rather than determining precisely whether a number is prime (has
no divisors), uses a statistical technique to decide whether the number is
`probably' prime. A number that passes this test was, before about 1985,
called a `pseudoprime' (the terminology used by number theorists has since
changed slightly; pre-1985 pseudoprimes are now `probable primes' and
`pseudoprime' has a more restricted meaning in modular arithmetic). The
hacker backgammon usage stemmed from the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as
good as a prime: it does the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that
probably won't happen.
