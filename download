 :download: vt. To transfer data or (esp.) code from a larger `host' system
(esp. a {mainframe}) over a digital comm link to a smaller `client' system,
esp. a microcomputer or specialized peripheral. Oppose {upload}. However,
note that ground-to-space communications has its own usage rule for this
term. Space-to-earth transmission is always download and the reverse upload
regardless of the relative size of the computers involved. So far the
in-space machines have invariably been smaller; thus the upload/download
distinction has been reversed from its usual sense.
