 :swap: vt. 1. [techspeak] To move information from a fast-access memory to a
slow-access memory (`swap out'), or vice versa (`swap in'). Often refers
specifically to the use of disks as `virtual memory'. As pieces of data or
program are needed, they are swapped into {core} for processing; when they
are no longer needed they may be swapped out again. 2. The jargon use of
these terms analogizes people's short-term memories with core. Cramming for
an exam might be spoken of as swapping in. If you temporarily forget
someone's name, but then remember it, your excuse is that it was swapped out.
To `keep something swapped in' means to keep it fresh in your memory: "I
reread the TECO manual every few months to keep it swapped in." If someone
interrupts you just as you got a good idea, you might say "Wait a moment
while I swap this out", implying that the piece of paper is your
extra-somatic memory and if you don't swap the info out by writing it down it
will get overwritten and lost as you talk. Compare {page in}, {page out}.
