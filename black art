 BLACK ART n. A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication)
mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or systems
area. VLSI design and compiler code optimization were (in their beginnings)
considered classic examples of black art; as theory developed they became
DEEP MAGIC, and once standard textbooks had been written became merely HEAVY
WIZARDRY. The huge proliferation of formal and informal channels for
spreading around new computer-related technologies during the last twenty
years has made both the term "black art" and what it describes less common
than formerly.
