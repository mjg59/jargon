 :black art: n. [common] A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by
implication) mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application
or systems area (compare {black magic}). VLSI design and compiler code
optimization were (in their beginnings) considered classic examples of black
art; as theory developed they became {deep magic}, and once standard
textbooks had been written, became merely {heavy wizardry}. The huge
proliferation of formal and informal channels for spreading around new
computer-related technologies during the last twenty years has made both the
term black art and what it describes less common than formerly. see also
{voodoo programming}.
