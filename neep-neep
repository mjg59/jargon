 :neep-neep: /neep neep/ [onomatopoeic, from New York SF fandom] n. One who
is fascinated by computers. More general than {hacker}, as it need not imply
more skill than is required to boot games on a PC. The derived noun
`neep-neeping' applies specifically to the long conversations about computers
that tend to develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties. Fandom has
a related proverb to the effect that "Hacking is a conversational black
hole!".
