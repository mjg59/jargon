 :neep-neep: /neep neep/ [onomatopoeic, from New York SF fandom] n. One who
is fascinated by computers. Less specific than {hacker}, as it need not imply
more skill than is required to boot games on a PC. The derived noun `neeping'
applies specifically to the long conversations about computers that tend to
develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties (the term `neepery' is
also in wide use). Fandom has a related proverb to the effect that "Hacking
is a conversational black hole!".
