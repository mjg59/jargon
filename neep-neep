 NEEP-NEEP (neep neep) [onomatopoic, from New York SF fandom] n. One who is
fascinated by computers. More general than HACKER, as it need not imply more
skill than is required to boot games on a PC. The gerund NEEP-NEEPING applies
specifically to the long conversations about computers that tend to develop
in the corners at most SF-convention parties. Fandom has a related proverb to
the effect that "Hacking is a conversational black hole!" [which, by
coincidence, has been attributed to my SO -- ESR]
