 :push: [from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also PUSH
/push/ or PUSHJ /pushÂ´J/, the latter based on the PDP-10 procedure call
instruction.) 1. To put something onto a {stack}. If one says that something
has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the Damoclean list of things
hanging over ones's head has grown longer and heavier yet. This may also
imply that one will deal with it before other pending items; otherwise one
might say that the thing was `added to my queue'. 2. vi. To enter upon a
digression, to save the current discussion for later. Antonym of {pop}; see
also {stack}.
