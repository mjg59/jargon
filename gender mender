 :gender mender: n. A cable connector shell with either two male or two
female connectors on it, used to correct the mismatches that result when some
{loser} didn't understand the RS232C specification and the distinction
between DTE and DCE. Used esp. for RS-232C parts in either the original D-25
or the IBM PC's bogus D-9 format. Also called `gender bender', `gender
blender', `sex changer', and even `homosexual adapter'; however, there
appears to be some confusion as to whether a `male homosexual adapter' has
pins on both sides (is male) or sockets on both sides (connects two males).
