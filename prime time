 :prime time: /n./ [from TV programming] Normal high-usage hours on a
timesharing system; the day shift. Avoidance of prime time was traditionally
given as a major reason for {night mode} hacking. The rise of the personal
workstation has rendered this term, along with timesharing itself, almost
obsolete. The hackish tendency to late-night {hacking run}s has changed not a
bit.
