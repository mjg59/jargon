 :prime time: n. [from TV programming] Normal high-usage hours on a system or
network. Back in the days of big timesharing machines `prime time' was when
lots of people were competing for limited cycles, usually the day shift.
Avoidance of prime time was traditionally given as a major reason for {night
mode} hacking. The term fell into disuse during the early PC era, but has
been revived to refer to times of day or evening at which the Internet tends
to be heavily loaded, making Web access slow. The hackish tendency to
late-night {hacking run}s has changed not a bit.
