 :gorilla arm: n. The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens as a
mainstream input technology despite a promising start in the early 1980s. It
seems the designers of all those {spiffy} touch-menu systems failed to notice
that humans aren't designed to hold their arms in front of their faces making
small motions. After more than a very few selections, the arm begins to feel
sore, cramped, and oversized -- the operator looks like a gorilla while using
the touch screen and feels like one afterwards. This is now considered a
classic cautionary tale to human-factors designers; "Remember the gorilla
arm!" is shorthand for "How is this going to fly in real use?".
