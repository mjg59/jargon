 GORILLA ARM (gor-il'uh arm) n. The side-effect that destroyed touch-screens
as a mainstream input technology despite a promising start in the early
eighties. It seems the designers of all those SPIFFY touch-menu systems
failed to notice that humans aren't designed to hold their arms in front of
their faces making small motions. After more than a very few selects the arm
begins to feel sore, cramped, and oversized, hence "gorilla arm". This is now
considered a classic Horrible Example and cautionary tale to human-factors
designers; "remember the gorilla arm" is shorthand for "how's this gonna fly
in *real* use?"
