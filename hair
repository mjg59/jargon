 :hair: n. [back-formation from {hairy}] The complications that make
something hairy. "Decoding {TECO} commands requires a certain amount of
hair." Often seen in the phrase `infinite hair', which connotes extreme
complexity. Also in `hairiferous' (tending to promote hair growth): "GNUMACS
elisp encourages lusers to write complex editing modes." "Yeah, it's pretty
hairiferous all right." (or just: "Hair squared!")
