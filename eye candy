 :eye candy: /i:´ kand`ee/, n. [from mainstream slang "ear candy"] A display
of some sort that's presented to {luser}s to keep them distracted while the
program performs necessary background tasks. "Give 'em some eye candy while
the back-end {slurp}s that {BLOB} into core." Reported as mainstream usage
among players of graphics-heavy computer games. We're also told this term is
mainstream slang for soft pornography, but that sense does not appear to be
live among hackers.
