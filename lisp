 LISP n. The name of AI's mother tongue, a language based on the ideas of 1)
variable-length lists and trees as fundamental data types, and 2) the
interpretation of code as data and vice-versa. Invented by John McCarthy at
Stanford in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other HLL still in
use except FORTRAN. Accordingly, it has undergone considerable adaptive
radiation over the years; modern variants (of which Scheme is perhaps the
most successful) are quite different in detail from the original LISP 1.5 at
Stanford. The hands-down favorite of hackers until the early 1980s, LISP now
shares the throne with C (q.v.). see LANGUAGES OF CHOICE.
