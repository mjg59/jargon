 LISP (lisp) n. The name of AI's mother tongue, a language based on the ideas
of 1) variable-length lists and trees as fundamental data types, and 2) the
interpretation of code as data and vice-versa. Invented by John McCarthy at
Stanford in the late 1950s, it is actually older than any other HLL still in
use except FORTRAN. The hands-down favorite of hackers until the early 1980s,
it now shares the throne with C (q.v.). see LANGUAGES OF CHOICE.
