 GIGO: /gi:'goh/ [acronym] 1. `Garbage In, Garbage Out' --- usually said in
response to {luser}s who complain that a program didn't complain about faulty
data. Also commonly used to describe failures in human decision making due to
faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data. 2. `Garbage In, Gospel Out': this more
recent expansion is a sardonic comment on the tendency human beings have to
put excessive trust in `computerized' data. gillion: /gil'y*n/ or /jil'y*n/
[formed from {giga-} by analogy with mega/million and tera/trillion] n. 10^9.
Same as an American billion or a British `milliard'. How one pronounces this
depends on whether one speaks {giga-} with a hard or soft `g'.
