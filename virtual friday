 :virtual Friday: n. (also logical Friday) The last day before an extended
weekend, if that day is not a `real' Friday. For example, the U.S. holiday
Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday. The next day is often also a holiday or
taken as an extra day off, in which case Wednesday of that week is a virtual
Friday (and Thursday is a virtual Saturday, as is Friday). There are also
virtual Mondays that are actually Tuesdays, after the three-day weekends
associated with many national holidays in the U.S.
