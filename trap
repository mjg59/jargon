 :trap: 1. /n./ A program interrupt, usually an interrupt caused by some
exceptional situation in the user program. In most cases, the OS performs
some action, then returns control to the program. 2. /vi./ To cause a trap.
"These instructions trap to the monitor." Also used transitively to indicate
the cause of the trap. "The monitor traps all input/output instructions."
This term is associated with assembler programming (`interrupt' or
`exception' is more common among {HLL} programmers) and appears to be fading
into history among programmers as the role of assembler continues to shrink.
However, it is still important to computer architects and systems hackers
(see {system}, sense 1), who use it to distinguish deterministically
repeatable exceptions from timing-dependent ones (such as I/O interrupts).
