 TRAP 1. n. A program interrupt, usually used specifically to refer to an
interrupt caused by some illegal action taking place in the user program. In
most cases the system monitor performs some action related to the nature of
the illegality, then returns control to the program. see UUO in Appendix B.
2. v. To cause a trap. "These instructions trap to the monitor." Also used
transitively to indicate the cause of the trap. "The monitor traps all
input/output instructions." This term is associated with assembler
programming (INTERRUPT is more common among HLL programmers) and appears to
be fading into history as the role of assembler continues to shrink.
