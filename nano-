 :nano-: [SI: the next quantifier below {micro-}; meaning * 10^(-9)] pref.
Smaller than {micro-}, and used in the same rather loose and connotative way.
Thus, one has {{nanotechnology}} (coined by hacker K. Eric Drexler) by
analogy with `microtechnology'; and a few machine architectures have a
`nanocode' level below `microcode'. Tom Duff at Bell Labs has also pointed
out that "Pi seconds is a nanocentury". see also {{quantifiers}}, {pico-},
{nanoacre}, {nanobot}, {nanocomputer}, {nanofortnight}.
