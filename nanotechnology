 :nanotechnology:: /nan'-oh-tek-no`l*-jee/ /n./ A hypothetical fabrication
technology in which objects are designed and built with the individual
specification and placement of each separate atom. The first unequivocal
nanofabrication experiments took place in 1990, for example with the
deposition of individual xenon atoms on a nickel substrate to spell the logo
of a certain very large computer company. Nanotechnology has been a hot topic
in the hacker subculture ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in
his book "Engines of Creation", where he predicted that nanotechnology could
give rise to replicating assemblers, permitting an exponential growth of
productivity and personal wealth. see also {blue goo}, {gray goo}, {nanobot}.
