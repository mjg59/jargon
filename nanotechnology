 NANOTECHNOLOGY (nan'-oh-tek-naw`l:-ji) n. A hypothetical fabrication
technology in which objects are designed and built with the individual
specification and placement of each separate atom. The first unequivocal
nano-fabrication experiments are taking place now (1990), for example with
the deposition of individual Xenon atoms on a nickel substrate to spell the
logo of a certain very large computer company by two of its physicists.
Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture ever since the
term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book "Engines of Creation", where
he predicted that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating ASSEMBLERs,
permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth.
