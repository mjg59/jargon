 :programming: n. 1. The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper (or, in
these days of on-line editing, the art of debugging an empty file). 2. A
pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer
opportunities for reward. 3. The most fun you can have with your clothes on
(although clothes are not mandatory).
