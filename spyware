 :spyware: n. 1. Software which, when installed by a user insufficiently
enlightened to avoid it, enables third parties to snoop the user's hard drive
or monitor their network transactions. Though the term seems to have entered
use in the late 1990s, it achieved real popularity as applied to Microsoft
Windows XP. Some {back door} features in XP permit Microsoft to (for example)
covertly scan your disk directories for the names of files it might deem to
be {warez}. 2. Systems for spying on email and web traffic, such as the FBI's
Carnivore.
