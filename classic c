 CLASSIC C /klas'ik see/ [a play on `Coke Classic'] n. The C programming
language as defined in the first edition of the book "The C Programming
Language" by "Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie" with some small
additions. It is also known as "K & R C." The name came into use during the
standardisation process for C by the ANSI X3J11 committee. Also "C CLASSIC".
This is sometimes generalized to "X Classic" where X = Star Trek (referring
to the original TV series), or X = PC (referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as
opposed to the PS/2 series); this generalization is especially used of
product series in which the newer versions are considered serious losers
relative to the older ones.
