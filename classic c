 :Classic C: /klas'ik C/ [a play on `Coke Classic'] /n./ The C programming
language as defined in the first edition of {K&R}, with some small additions.
It is also known as `K&R C'. The name came into use while C was being
standardized by the ANSI X3J11 committee. Also `C Classic'. An analogous
construction is sometimes applied elsewhere: thus, `X Classic', where X =
Star Trek (referring to the original TV series) or X = PC (referring to IBM's
ISA-bus machines as opposed to the PS/2 series). This construction is
especially used of product series in which the newer versions are considered
serious losers relative to the older ones.
