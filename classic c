 CHURCH OF THE SUB-GENIUS A mutant offshoot of DISCORDIANISM launched in 1981
as a spoof of fundamentalist Christianity by the "Rev." Ivan Stang, a
brilliant satirist with a gift for promotion. Popular among hackers as a rich
source of bizarre imagery and references such as: "Bob" the divine
drilling-equipment salesman, the Benevolent Space Xists and the Stark Fist of
Removal. Much Sub-Genius theory is concerned with the acquisition of the
mystical substance or quality of "slack". CLASSIC C (klas'ik see) [a play on
`Classic Coke'] n. The C programming language as defined in the first edition
of the book "The C Programming Language" by "Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M.
Ritchie" with some small additions. It is also known as "K & R C." The name
came into use during the standardisation process for C by the ANSI X3J11
committee. Also "C CLASSIC". This is sometimes generalized to "X Classic"
where X = Star Trek (referring to the original TV series), or X = PC
(referring to IBM's ISA-bus machines as opposed to the PS/2 series); this
generalization is especially used of product series in which the newer
versions are considered serious losers relative to the older ones.
