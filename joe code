 JOE CODE /joh kohd/ [said to commemmorate a notoriously bad coder named Joe
at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory] n. Badly written, possibly buggy source
code. "Perl may be a handy program, but if you look at the source, it's
complete joe code." Correspondents wishing to remain anonymous have fingered
a particular Joe and observed that usage has drifted slightly; they described
his code as "overly TENSE and unmaintainable". {= K =}
