 :joe code: /joh' kohd`/ n. 1. Code that is overly {tense} and
unmaintainable. "{Perl} may be a handy program, but if you look at the
source, it's complete joe code." 2. Badly written, possibly buggy code.
Correspondents wishing to remain anonymous have fingered a particular Joe at
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and observed that usage has drifted
slightly; the original sobriquet `Joe code' was intended in sense 1.
