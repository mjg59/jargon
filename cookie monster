 :cookie monster: n. [from the children's TV program "Sesame Street"] Any of
a family of early (1970s) hacks reported on {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}},
{{Multics}}, and elsewhere that would lock up either the victim's terminal
(on a time-sharing machine) or the {{console}} (on a batch {mainframe}),
repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE". The required responses ranged in
complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A COOKIE" and upward. see also
{wabbit}.
