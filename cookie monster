 :cookie monster: /n./ [from the children's TV program "Sesame Street"] Any
of a family of early (1970s) hacks reported on {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}},
{{Multics}}, and elsewhere that would lock up either the victim's terminal
(on a time-sharing machine) or the {{console}} (on a batch {mainframe}),
repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE". The required responses ranged in
complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A COOKIE" and upward. Folklorist Jan
Brunvand (see {FOAF}) has described these programs as urban legends (implying
they probably never existed) but they existed, all right, in several
different versions. see also {wabbit}. Interestingly, the term `cookie
monster' appears to be a {retcon}; the original term was {cookie bear}.
