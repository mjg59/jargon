 COOKIE MONSTER [from "Sesame Street"] n. Any of a family of early (1970s)
hacks reported on TOPS-10, ITS and elsewhere that would lock up either the
victim's terminal (on a time-sharing machine) or the operator's console (on a
batch mainframe), repeatedly demanding "I WANT A COOKIE". The required
responses ranged in complexity from "COOKIE" through "HAVE A COOKIE" and
upward. see also WABBIT.
