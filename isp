 :ISP: /I·S·P/ Common abbreviation for Internet Service Provider, a kind of
company that barely existed before 1993. ISPs sell Internet access to the
mass market. While the big nationwide commercial BBSs with Internet access
(like America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, Netcom, etc.) are technically ISPs,
the term is usually reserved for local or regional small providers (often run
by hackers turned entrepreneurs) who resell Internet access cheaply without
themselves being information providers or selling advertising. Compare {NSP}.
