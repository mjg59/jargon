 :book titles:: There is a tradition in hackerdom of informally tagging
important textbooks and standards documents with the dominant color of their
covers or with some other conspicuous feature of the cover. Many of these are
described in this lexicon under their own entries. see {Aluminum Book}, {Blue
Book}, {Camel Book}, {Cinderella Book}, {Devil Book}, {Dragon Book}, {Green
Book}, {Orange Book}, {Pink-Shirt Book}, {Purple Book}, {Red Book}, {Silver
Book}, {White Book}, {Wizard Book}, {Yellow Book}, and {bible}; see also
{rainbow series}. Since about 1993 this tradition has gotten a boost from the
popular O'Reilly Associates line of technical books, which usually feature
some kind of exotic animal on the cover.
