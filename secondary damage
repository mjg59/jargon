 :secondary damage: n. When a fatal error occurs (esp. a {segfault}) the
immediate cause may be that a pointer has been trashed due to a previous
{fandango on core}. However, this fandango may have been due to an _earlier_
fandango, so no amount of analysis will reveal (directly) how the damage
occurred. "The data structure was clobbered, but it was secondary damage." By
extension, the corruption resulting from N cascaded fandangoes on core is
`Nth-level damage'. There is at least one case on record in which 17 hours of
{grovel}ling with `adb' actually dug up the underlying bug behind an instance
of seventh-level damage! The hacker who accomplished this near-superhuman
feat was presented with an award by his fellows.
