 COSMIC RAYS n. Notionally, the cause of BIT ROT (q.v.). However, this is a
semi-independent usage which may be invoked as a humorous way of HANDWAVING
away any minor RANDOMNESS that doesn't seem worth the bother of
investigating. "Hey, Eric --- I just got a burst of garbage on my TUBE, where
did that come from?" "Cosmic rays, I guess". Compare SUNSPOTS, PHASE OF THE
MOON. The British seem to prefer the usage `cosmic showers'.
