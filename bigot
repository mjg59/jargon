 :bigot: /n./ A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer,
language, operating system, editor, or other tool (see {religious issues}).
Usually found with a specifier; thus, `cray bigot', `ITS bigot', `APL bigot',
`VMS bigot', `Berkeley bigot'. Real bigots can be distinguished from mere
partisans or zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn alternatives even
when the march of time and/or technology is threatening to obsolete the
favored tool. It is truly said "You can tell a bigot, but you can't tell him
much." Compare {weenie}.
