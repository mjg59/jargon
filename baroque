 :baroque: /adj./ Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on excessive.
Said of hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the
connotations of {elephantine} or {monstrosity} but is less extreme and not
pejorative in itself. "Metafont even has features to introduce random
variations to its letterform output. Now *that* is baroque!" see also
{rococo}.
