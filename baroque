 :baroque: adj. [common] Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on
excessive. Said of hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the
connotations of {elephantine} or {monstrosity} but is less extreme and not
pejorative in itself. "Metafont even has features to introduce random
variations to its letterform output. Now _that_ is baroque!" see also
{rococo}.
