 :baroque: adj. [common] Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on
excessive. Said of hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the
connotations of {elephantine} or {monstrosity} but is less extreme and not
pejorative in itself. In the absence of other, more negative descriptions
this term suggests that the software is trembling on the edge of bad taste
but has not quite tipped over into it. "Metafont even has features to
introduce random variations to its letterform output. Now that is baroque!"
see also {rococo}.
