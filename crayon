 :crayon: n. 1. Someone who works on Cray supercomputers. More specifically,
it implies a programmer, probably of the CDC ilk, probably male, and almost
certainly wearing a tie (irrespective of gender). Systems types who have a
UNIX background tend not to be described as crayons. 2. A {computron} (sense
2) that participates only in {number-crunching}. 3. A unit of computational
power equal to that of a single Cray-1. There is a standard joke about this
that derives from an old Crayola crayon promotional gimmick: When you buy 64
crayons you get a free sharpener.
