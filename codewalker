 CODEWALKER n. A program component that traverses other programs for a
living. Compilers have codewalkers in their front ends; so do cross-reference
generators and some database front-ends. Other utility programs which try to
do too much with source code may turn into codewalkers. As in "This new
vgrind feature would require a codewalker to implement."
