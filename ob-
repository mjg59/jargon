 :Ob-: /ob/ pref. Obligatory. A piece of {netiquette} acknowledging that the
author has been straying from the newsgroup's charter topic. For example, if
a posting in alt.sex is a response to a part of someone else's posting that
has nothing particularly to do with sex, the author may append `ObSex' (or
`Obsex') and toss off a question or vignette about some unusual erotic act.
It is considered a sign of great {winnitude} when one's Obs are more
interesting than other people's whole postings.
