 -*- Mode: Text -*- Notes on updating this file: This file is maintained at
three locations. It is AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] at SAIL, and GLS;JARGON > at MIT-MC
and at MIT-AI. If you make any changes, please FTP the new file to the other
location. (NOTE: Use ASCII mode in FTP to avoid screwing up the tilde char!)
It is also a good idea to compare this file against the copy on the other
machine before FTP'ing and to merge any changes found there, in case someone
else forgot to do the FTP. Also, please let us know (see list of names below)
about your changes so that we can double-check them. Try to conform to the
format already being used--70 character lines, 3-character indentations,
pronunciations in parentheses, etymologies in brackets, single-space after
def'n numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the standard ASCII character
set. If you'd rather not mung the file yourself, send your definitions to DON
@ SAIL, GLS @ MIT-AI, and/or MRC @ SAIL. The last edit (of this line, anyway)
was by Don Woods, 82-11-14.
======================================================================
Compiled by Guy L. Steele Jr., Raphael Finkel, Donald Woods, Geoff Goodfellow
and Mark Crispin, with assistance from the MIT and Stanford AI communities
and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Some contributions were submitted via
the ARPAnet from miscellaneous sites. Verb doubling: a standard construction
is to double a verb and use it as a comment on what the implied subject does.
Often used to terminate a conversation. Typical examples involve WIN, LOSE,
HACK, FLAME, BARF, CHOMP: "The disk heads just crashed." "Lose, lose."
"Mostly he just talked about his --- crock. Flame, flame." "Boy, what a
bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!" Soundalike slang: similar to Cockney rhyming slang.
Often made up on the spur of the moment. Standard examples: Boston Globe =>
Boston Glob Herald American => Horrid (Harried) American New York Times =>
New York Slime historical reasons => hysterical raisins government property -
do not duplicate (seen on keys) => government duplicity - do not propagate
Often the substitution will be made in such a way as to slip in a standard
jargon word: Dr. Dobb's Journal => Dr. Frob's Journal creeping featurism =>
feeping creaturism Margaret Jacks Hall => Marginal Hacks Hall The -P
convention: turning a word into a question by appending the syllable "P";
from the LISP convention of appending the letter "P" to denote a predicate (a
Boolean-values function). The question should expect a yes/no answer, though
it needn't. (see T and NIL.) At dinnertime: "Foodp?" "Yeah, I'm pretty
hungry." or "T!" "State-of-the-world-P?" (Straight) "I'm about to go home."
(Humorous) "Yes, the world has a state." [One of the best of these is a
Gosperism (i.e., due to Bill Gosper). When we were at a Chinese restaurant,
he wanted to know whether someone would like to share with him a
two-person-sized bowl of soup. His inquiry was: "Split-p soup?" --GLS]
Peculiar nouns: MIT AI hackers love to take various words and add the wrong
endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule
to nonuniform cases. Examples: porous => porosity generous => generosity
Ergo: mysterious => mysteriosity ferrous => ferocity Other examples:
winnitude, disgustitude, hackification. Spoken inarticulations: Words such as
"mumble", "sigh", and "groan" are spoken in places where their referent might
more naturally be used. It has been suggested that this usage derives from
the impossibility of representing such noises in a com link. Another
expression sometimes heard is "complain!" @BEGIN (primarily CMU) with @END,
used humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the
surrounded text. From the SCRIBE command of the same name. For example:
@Begin(Flame) Predicate logic is the only good programming language. Anyone
who would use anything else is an idiot. Also, computers should be tredecimal
instead of binary. @End(Flame) ANGLE BRACKETS (primarily MIT) n. Either of
the characters "<" and ">". see BROKET.
