 :backbone site: n. A key Usenet and email site; one that processes a large
amount of third-party traffic, especially if it is the home site of any of
the regional coordinators for the Usenet maps. Notable backbone sites as of
early 1993, when this sense of the term was beginning to pass out of general
use due to wide availability of cheap Internet connections, include uunet and
the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, {DEC}'s Western
Research Laboratories, Ohio State University, and the University of Texas.
Compare {rib site}, {leaf site}. [1996 update: This term is seldom heard
anymore. The UUCP network world that gave it meaning has nearly disappeared;
everyone is on the Internet now and network traffic is distributed in very
different patterns. --ESR]
