 :backbone site: n.,obs. Formerly, a key Usenet and email site, one that
processes a large amount of third-party traffic, especially if it is the home
site of any of the regional coordinators for the Usenet maps. Notable
backbone sites as of early 1993, when this sense of the term was beginning to
pass out of general use due to wide availability of cheap Internet
connections, included uunet and the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC
Berkeley, {DEC}'s Western Research Laboratories, Ohio State University, and
the University of Texas. Compare {leaf site}. [2001 update: This term has
passed into history. The UUCP network world that gave it meaning is gone;
everyone is on the Internet now and network traffic is distributed in very
different patterns. Today one might see references to a "backbone router"
instead --ESR]
