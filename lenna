 :lenna: The Internet's first poster girl, a standard test load used in the
image processing community. The image was originally cropped from the
November 1972 issue of Playboy Magazine, which anglicized the model's name
with a double n. It has interesting properties -- complex feathers, shadows,
smooth (but not flat) surfaces -- that are pertinent in demonstrating various
processing algorithms for image compression, filtering, dithering, texture
mapping, image recognition, and so on. After a quarter century of remaining
completely unaware that she had become an icon, a gray-haired but still
winsome Lenna finally met her fans at a computer graphics conference in 1997.
