 USER (yoo'zr) n. A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One
who asks questions. Identified at MIT with "loser" by the spelling "luser".
see REAL USER. [Note by GLS: I don't agree with RF's definition at all.
Basically, there are two classes of people who work with a program: there are
implementors (hackers) and users (losers). The users are looked down on by
hackers to a mild degree because they don't understand the full ramifications
of the system in all its glory. (A few users who do are known as real
winners.) It is true that users ask questions (of necessity). Very often they
are annoying or downright stupid.]
