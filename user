 USER n. 1. Someone doing "real work" with the computer, who uses a computer
as a means rather than an end. Someone who pays to use a computer. see REAL
USER. 2. A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One who asks
silly questions. (This is slightly unfair. It is true that users ask
questions (of necessity). Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep. Very often
they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently because the user failed to
think for two seconds or look in the documentation before bothering the
maintainer.) see LUSER. 3. Someone who uses a program from the outside,
however skillfully, without getting into the internals of the program. One
who reports bugs instead of just going ahead and fixing them. Basically,
there are two classes of people who work with a program: there are
implementors (hackers) and users (losers). The users are looked down on by
hackers to a mild degree because they don't understand the full ramifications
of the system in all its glory. (The few users who do are known as REAL
WINNERS.) The term is a relative one: a consummate hacker may be a user with
respect to some program he himself does not hack. A LISP hacker might be one
who maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with the skill of a hacker). A
LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether skillfully or not. Thus there is some
overlap between the two terms; the subtle distinctions must be resolved by
context.
