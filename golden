 :golden: adj. [prob.: from folklore's `golden egg'] When used to describe a
magnetic medium (e.g., golden disk, golden tape), describes one containing a
tested, up-to-spec, ready-to-ship software version. Compare
{platinum-iridium}. One may also "go gold", which is the act of releasing a
golden version. The gold color of many CDROMs is a coincidence; this term was
well established a decade before CDROM distribution become common in the
mid-1990s.
