 PUNT [from the punch line of an old joke referring to American football:
"Drop back 15 yards and punt"] v. To give up, typically without any intention
of retrying. "Let's punt the movie tonight." "I was going to hack all night
to get this feature in, but I decided to punt" may mean that you've decided
not to stay up all night, and may also mean you're not ever even going to put
in the feature.
