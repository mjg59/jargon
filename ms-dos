 1985, most customers had already made the traumatic decision to abandon the
PDP-10, usually for VMS or Unix boxes. Most of the Mars computers built ended
up being purchased by CompuServe. This tale and the related saga of {Foonly}
hold a lesson for hackers: if you want to play in the {Real World}, you need
to learn Real World moves. :martian: n. A packet sent on a TCP/IP network
with a source address of the test loopback interface [127.0.0.1]. This means
that it will come back labeled with a source address that is clearly not of
this earth. "The domain server is getting lots of packets from Mars. Does
that gateway have a martian filter?" Compare {Christmas tree packet},
{Godzillagram}. :massage: vt. [common] Vague term used to describe `smooth'
transformations of a data set into a different form, esp. transformations
that do not lose information. Connotes less pain than {munch} or {crunch}.
"He wrote a program that massages X bitmap files into GIF format." Compare
{slurp}. :math-out: n. [poss. from `white-out' (the blizzard variety)] A
paper or presentation so encrusted with mathematical or other formal notation
as to be incomprehensible. This may be a device for concealing the fact that
it is actually {content-free}. see also {numbers}, {social science number}.
:Matrix: n. [FidoNet] 1. What the Opus BBS software and sysops call
{FidoNet}. 2. Fanciful term for a {cyberspace} expected to emerge from
current networking experiments (see {the network}). The name of the rather
good 1999 {cypherpunk} movie "The Matrix" played on this sense, which however
had been established for years before. 3. The totality of present-day
computer networks (popularized in this sense by John Quarterman; rare outside
academic literature). :maximum Maytag mode: n. What a {washing machine} or,
by extension, any disk drive is in when it's being used so heavily that it's
shaking like an old Maytag with an unbalanced load. If prolonged for any
length of time, can lead to disks becoming {walking drives}. In 1999 it's
been some years since hard disks were large enough to do this, but the same
phenomenon has recently been reported with 24X CD-ROM drives. :meatspace:
/meet'spays/ n. The physical world, where the meat lives - as opposed to
{cyberspace}. Hackers are actually more willing to use this term than
`cyberspace', because it's not speculative - we already have a running
meatspace implementation (the universe). Compare {RL}. :meatware: n. Synonym
for {wetware}. Less common. :meeces: /mees'*z/ n. [TMRC] Occasional furry
visitors who are not {urchin}s. [That is, mice. This may no longer be in live
use; it clearly derives from the refrain of the early-1960s cartoon character
Mr. Jinx: "I hate meeces to _pieces_!" -- ESR] :meg: /meg/ n. see
{{quantifiers}}. :mega-: /me'g*/ pref. [SI] see {{quantifiers}}. :megapenny:
/meg'*-pen`ee/ n. $10,000 (1 cent * 10^6). Used semi-humorously as a unit in
comparing computer cost and performance figures. :MEGO: /me'goh/ or /mee'goh/
[`My Eyes Glaze Over', often `Mine Eyes Glazeth (sic) Over', attributed to
the futurologist Herman Kahn] Also `MEGO factor'. 1. n. A {handwave} intended
to confuse the listener and hopefully induce agreement because the listener
does not want to admit to not understanding what is going on. MEGO is usually
directed at senior management by engineers and contains a high proportion of
{TLA}s. 2. excl. An appropriate response to MEGO tactics. 3. Among
non-hackers, often refers not to behavior that causes the eyes to glaze, but
to the eye-glazing reaction itself, which may be triggered by the mere threat
of technical detail as effectively as by an actual excess of it. :meltdown,
network: n. see {network meltdown}. :meme: /meem/ n. [coined by analogy with
`gene', by Richard Dawkins] An idea considered as a {replicator}, esp. with
the connotation that memes parasitize people into propagating them much as
viruses do. Used esp. in the phrase `meme complex' denoting a group of
mutually supporting memes that form an organized belief system, such as a
religion. This lexicon is an (epidemiological) vector of the `hacker
subculture' meme complex; each entry might be considered a meme. However,
`meme' is often misused to mean `meme complex'. Use of the term connotes
acceptance of the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and
language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas
has superseded biological evolution by selection of hereditary traits.
Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably obvious reasons. :meme plague:
n. The spread of a successful but pernicious {meme}, esp. one that
parasitizes the victims into giving their all to propagate it. Astrology,
BASIC, and the other guy's religion are often considered to be examples. This
usage is given point by the historical fact that `joiner' ideologies like
Naziism or various forms of millennarian Christianity have exhibited
plague-like cycles of exponential growth followed by collapses to small
reservoir populations. :memetics: /me-met'iks/ n. [from {meme}] The study of
memes. As of early 1999, this is still an extremely informal and speculative
endeavor, though the first steps towards at least statistical rigor have been
made by H. Keith Henson and others. Memetics is a popular topic for
speculation among hackers, who like to see themselves as the architects of
the new information ecologies in which memes live and replicate. :memory
farts: n. The flatulent sounds that some DOS box BIOSes (most notably AMI's)
make when checking memory on bootup. :memory leak: n. An error in a program's
dynamic-store allocation logic that causes it to fail to reclaim discarded
memory, leading to eventual collapse due to memory exhaustion. Also (esp. at
CMU) called {core leak}. These problems were severe on older machines with
small, fixed-size address spaces, and special "leak detection" tools were
commonly written to root them out. With the advent of virtual memory, it is
unfortunately easier to be sloppy about wasting a bit of memory (although
when you run out of memory on a VM machine, it means you've got a _real_
leak!). see {aliasing bug}, {fandango on core}, {smash the stack},
{precedence lossage}, {overrun screw}, {leaky heap}, {leak}. :memory smash:
n. [XEROX PARC] Writing through a pointer that doesn't point to what you
think it does. This occasionally reduces your machine to a rubble of bits.
Note that this is subtly different from (and more general than) related terms
such as a {memory leak} or {fandango on core} because it doesn't imply an
allocation error or overrun condition. :menuitis: /men`yoo-i:'tis/ n.
Notional disease suffered by software with an obsessively simple-minded menu
interface and no escape. Hackers find this intensely irritating and much
prefer the flexibility of command-line or language-style interfaces,
especially those customizable via macros or a special-purpose language in
which one can encode useful hacks. see {user-obsequious}, {drool-proof
paper}, {WIMP environment}, {for the rest of us}. :mess-dos: /mes-dos/ n.
[semi-obsolescent now that DOS is] Derisory term for MS-DOS. Often followed
by the ritual banishing "Just say No!" see {{MS-DOS}}. Most hackers (even
many MS-DOS hackers) loathed MS-DOS for its single-tasking nature, its limits
on application size, its nasty primitive interface, and its ties to IBMness
and Microsoftness (see {fear and loathing}). Also `mess-loss', `messy-dos',
`mess-dog', `mess-dross', `mush-dos', and various combinations thereof. In
Ireland and the U.K. it is even sometimes called `Domestos' after a brand of
toilet cleanser. :meta: /me't*/ or /may't*/ or (Commonwealth) /mee't*/
adj.,pref. [from analytic philosophy] One level of description up. A
metasyntactic variable is a variable in notation used to describe syntax, and
meta-language is language used to describe language. This is difficult to
explain briefly, but much hacker humor turns on deliberate confusion between
meta-levels. see {{hacker humor}}. :meta bit: n. The top bit of an 8-bit
character, which is on in character values 128-255. Also called {high bit},
{alt bit}, or (rarely) {hobbit}. Some terminals and consoles (see
{space-cadet keyboard}) have a META shift key. Others (including, _mirabile
dictu_, keyboards on IBM PC-class machines) have an ALT key. see also {bucky
bits}. Historical note: although in modern usage shaped by a universe of
