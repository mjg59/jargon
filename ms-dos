 SF convention) over the July 4th weekend in 1980. It is not clear exactly
when the canonical @-party venue shifted to the Worldcon but it had certainly
become established by Constellation in 1983. Sadly, the @-party tradition has
been in decline since about 1996, mainly because having an @-address no
longer functions as an effective lodge pin. = A = ===== :abbrev: /*-breev'/,
/*-brev'/ n. Common abbreviation for `abbreviation'. :ABEND: /a'bend/,
/*-bend'/ n. [ABnormal END] 1. Abnormal termination (of software); {crash};
{lossage}. Derives from an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by
hackers but seriously mainly by {code grinder}s. Usually capitalized, but may
appear as `abend'. Hackers will try to persuade you that ABEND is called
`abend' because it is what system operators do to the machine late on Friday
when they want to call it a day, and hence is from the German `Abend' =
`Evening'. 2. [alt.callahans] Absent By Enforced Net Deprivation - used in
the subject lines of postings warning friends of an imminent loss of Internet
access. (This can be because of computer downtime, loss of provider, moving
or illness.) Variants of this also appear: ABVND = `Absent By Voluntary Net
Deprivation' and ABSEND = `Absent By Self-Enforced Net Deprivation' have been
sighted. :accumulator: n. obs. 1. Archaic term for a register. On-line use of
it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable indication that the user
has been around for quite a while and/or that the architecture under
discussion is quite old. The term in full is almost never used of
microprocessor registers, for example, though symbolic names for arithmetic
registers beginning in `A' derive from historical use of the term
`accumulator' (and not, actually, from `arithmetic'). Confusingly, though, an
`A' register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for example on the
Motorola 680x0 family. 2. A register being used for arithmetic or logic (as
opposed to addressing or a loop index), especially one being used to
accumulate a sum or count of many items. This use is in context of a
particular routine or stretch of code. "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an
accumulator." 3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense
1). "You want this reviewed? Sure, just put it in the accumulator." (see
{stack}.) :ACK: /ak/ interj. 1. [common; from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
Acknowledge. Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream _Yo!_). An
appropriate response to {ping} or {ENQ}. 2. [from the comic strip "Bloom
County"] An exclamation of surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"
Semi-humorous. Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is
distinguished by a following exclamation point. 3. Used to politely interrupt
someone to tell them you understand their point (see {NAK}). Thus, for
example, you might cut off an overly long explanation with "Ack. Ack. Ack. I
get it now". There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no reply, or
during a lull in {talk mode} to see if the person has gone away (the standard
humorous response is of course {NAK} (sense 2), i.e., "I'm not here"). :Acme:
n. The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry
- where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who specialized in
elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been humorously expanded as A
Company Making Everything. Describing some X as an "Acme X" either means
"This is {insanely great}", or, more likely, "This looks {insanely great} on
paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot with
it." Compare {pistol}. This term, specially cherished by American hackers and
explained here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the
Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons. In these cartoons, the
famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap, and
eat the Roadrunner. His attempts usually involved one or more high-technology
Rube Goldberg devices - rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps,
high-powered slingshots, etc. These were usually delivered in large cardboard
boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme name. These devices invariably
malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways. :acolyte: n. obs. [TMRC] An
{OSU} privileged enough to submit data and programs to a member of the
{priesthood}. :ad-hockery: /ad-hok'*r-ee/ n. [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems, which lead to
the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are in fact entirely
arbitrary. For example, fuzzy-matching of input tokens that might be typing
errors against a symbol table can make it look as though a program knows how
to spell. 2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would
otherwise cause a program to {choke}, presuming normal inputs are dealt with
in some cleaner and more regular way. Also called `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity'
(/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'. see also {ELIZA effect}. :Ada:: n. A
{{Pascal}}-descended language that has been made mandatory for Department of
Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers are nearly unanimous in
observing that, technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that
kind of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult to
use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle (one common
description wss "The PL/I of the 1980s"). Hackers find Ada's
exception-handling and inter-process communication features particularly
hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the daughter of Lord Byron who became the world's
first programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his
mechanical computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest thing that
has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language
screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk. :address
harvester: n. A robot that searches web pages and/or filters netnews traffic
looking for valid email addresses. Some address harvesters are benign, used
only for compiling address directories. Most, unfortunately, are run by
miscreants compiling address lists to {spam}. Address harvesters can be
foiled by a {teergrube}. :adger: /aj'r/ vt. [UCLA mutant of {nadger}, poss.
from the middle name of an infamous {tenured graduate student}] To make a
bonehead move with consequences that could have been foreseen with even
slight mental effort. E.g., "He started removing files and promptly adgered
the whole project". Compare {dumbass attack}. :admin: /ad-min'/ n. Short for
`administrator'; very commonly used in speech or on-line to refer to the
systems person in charge on a computer. Common constructions on this include
`sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the administrator's role as a site
contact for email and news) or `newsadmin' (focusing specifically on news).
Compare {postmaster}, {sysop}, {system mangler}. :ADVENT: /ad'vent/ n. The
prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will Crowther on the
{PDP-10} in the mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming,
and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976.
(Woods had been one of the authors of {INTERCAL}.) Now better known as
Adventure, but the {{TOPS-10}} operating system permitted only six-letter
filenames. see also {vadding}, {Zork}, and {Infocom}. This game defined the
terse, dryly humorous style since expected in text adventure games, and
popularized several tag lines that have become fixtures of hacker-speak: "A
huge green fierce snake bars the way!" "I see no X here" (for some noun X).
"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." "You are in a
little maze of twisty passages, all different." The `magic words' {xyzzy} and
{plugh} also derive from this game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the
exploration of the Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually _has_ a
`Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns
up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance. ADVENT
sources are available for FTP at
`ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/doc/misc/if-archive/games/source/advent.tar.Z'. :AFAIK:
// n. [Usenet] Abbrev. for "As Far As I Know". :AFJ: // n. Written-only
abbreviation for "April Fool's Joke". Elaborate April Fool's hoaxes are a
long-established tradition on Usenet and Internet; see {kremvax} for an
example. In fact, April Fool's Day is the _only_ seasonal holiday
consistently marked by customary observances on Internet and other hacker
networks. :AI: /A-I/ n. Abbreviation for `Artificial Intelligence', so common
that the full form is almost never written or spoken among hackers.
:AI-complete: /A-I k*m-pleet'/ adj. [MIT, Stanford: by analogy with
`NP-complete' (see {NP-})] Used to describe problems or subproblems in AI, to
indicate that the solution presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem'
(that is, the synthesis of a human-level intelligence). A problem that is
AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard. Examples of AI-complete
problems are `The Vision Problem' (building a system that can see as well as
a human) and `The Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can
understand and speak a natural language as well as a human). These may appear
to be modular, but all attempts so far (1999) to solve them have foundered on
the amount of context information and `intelligence' they seem to require.
see also {gedanken}. :AI koans: /A-I koh'anz/ pl.n. A series of pastiches of
Zen teaching riddles created by Danny Hillis at the MIT AI Lab around various
major figures of the Lab's culture (several are included under {Some AI
Koans} in Appendix A). see also {ha ha only serious}, {mu}, and {{hacker
humor}}. :AIDS: /aydz/ n. Short for A* Infected Disk Syndrome (`A*' is a
{glob} pattern that matches, but is not limited to, Apple or Amiga), this
condition is quite often the result of practicing unsafe {SEX}. see {virus},
{worm}, {Trojan horse}, {virgin}. :AIDX: /ayd'k*z/ n. Derogatory term for
IBM's perverted version of Unix, AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the
IBM RS/6000 series (some hackers think it is funnier just to pronounce "AIX"
as "aches"). A victim of the dreaded "hybridism" disease, this attempt to
combine the two main currents of the Unix stream ({BSD} and {USG Unix})
became a {monstrosity} to haunt system administrators' dreams. For example,
if new accounts are created while many users are logged on, the load average
jumps quickly over 20 due to silly implementation of the user databases. For
a quite similar disease, compare {HP-SUX}. Also, compare {Macintrash},
{Nominal Semidestructor}, {ScumOS}, {sun-stools}. :airplane rule: n.
"Complexity increases the possibility of failure; a twin-engine airplane has
twice as many engine problems as a single-engine airplane." By analogy, in
both software and electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness.
It is correspondingly argued that the right way to build reliable systems is
to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure that you've built a
really _good_ basket. see also {KISS Principle}. :Alderson loop: n. [Intel] A
special version of an {infinite loop} where there is an exit condition
available, but inaccessible in the current implementation of the code.
Typically this is created while debugging user interface code. An example
would be when there is a menu stating, "Select 1-3 or 9 to quit" and 9 is not
allowed by the function that takes the selection from the user. This term
received its name from a programmer who had coded a modal message box in
MSAccess with no Ok or Cancel buttons, thereby disabling the entire program
whenever the box came up. The message box had the proper code for dismissal
and even was set up so that when the non-existent Ok button was pressed the
proper code would be called. :aliasing bug: n. A class of subtle programming
errors that can arise in code that does dynamic allocation, esp. via
`malloc(3)' or equivalent. If several pointers address (`aliases for') a
given hunk of storage, it may happen that the storage is freed or reallocated
(and thus moved) through one alias and then referenced through another, which
may lead to subtle (and possibly intermittent) lossage depending on the state
and the allocation history of the malloc {arena}. Avoidable by use of
allocation strategies that never alias allocated core, or by use of
higher-level languages, such as {LISP}, which employ a garbage collector (see
{GC}). Also called a {stale pointer bug}. see also {precedence lossage},
{smash the stack}, {fandango on core}, {memory leak}, {memory smash},
{overrun screw}, {spam}. Historical note: Though this term is nowadays
associated with C programming, it was already in use in a very similar sense
in the Algol-60 and FORTRAN communities in the 1960s. :all-elbows: adj.
[MS-DOS] Of a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC program, such as the N
pop-up calendar and calculator utilities that circulate on {BBS} systems:
unsociable. Used to describe a program that rudely steals the resources that
it needs without considering that other TSRs may also be resident. One
particularly common form of rudeness is lock-up due to programs fighting over
the keyboard interrupt. see {rude}, also {mess-dos}. :alpha geek: n. [from
animal ethologists' `alpha male'] The most technically accomplished or
skillful person in some implied context. "Ask Larry, he's the alpha geek
here." :alpha particles: n. see {bit rot}. :alt: /awlt/ 1. n. The alt shift
key on an IBM PC or {clone} keyboard; see {bucky bits}, sense 2 (though
typical PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit). 2. n. The `option' key on
a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals that the speaker hacked PCs
before coming to the Mac (see also {feature key}, which is sometimes
_incorrectly_ called `alt'). 3. n.,obs. [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT]
Alternate name for the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap
labeling on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). This
character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system, in {TECO},
or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt alt to end a TECO command" or
"alt-U onto the system" (for "log onto the [ITS] system"). This usage
probably arose because alt is more convenient to say than `escape',
especially when followed by another alt or a character (or another alt _and_
a character, for that matter). 4. The alt hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of
newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and approval procedure.
There is a myth, not entirely implausible, that alt is acronymic for
"anarchists, lunatics, and terrorists"; but in fact it is simply short for
"alternative". :alt bit: /awlt bit/ [from alternate] adj. see {meta bit}.
:Aluminum Book: n. [MIT] "Common LISP: The Language", by Guy L. Steele Jr.
(Digital Press, first edition 1984, second edition 1990). Note that due to a
technical screwup some printings of the second edition are actually of a
color the author describes succinctly as "yucky green". see also {{book
titles}}. :ambimouseterous: /am-b*-mows'ter-us/ or /am-b*-mows'trus/ adj.
[modeled on ambidextrous] Able to use a mouse with either hand. :Amiga: n A
series of personal computer models originally sold by Commodore, based on
680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system that combined
some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with compatibility with
neither. The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious market
share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial technological
lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small but zealous
population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day unseating the clones
(see {Amiga Persecution Complex}). The traits of this culture are both
spoofed and illuminated in The BLAZE Humor Viewer
(http://www-ccsl.cs.umass.edu/~barrett/bm/Viewer_Sections/Main.HTML). The
strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small industry of companies building
software and hardware for the platform, especially in graphics and video
applications (see {video toaster}). Due to spectacular mismanagement,
Commodore did hardly any R&D, allowing the competition to close Amiga's
technological lead. After Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology
passed through several hands, none of whom did much with it. However, the
Amiga is still being produced in Europe under license and has a substantial
number of fans, which will probably extend the platform's life considerably.
:Amiga Persecution Complex: n. The disorder suffered by a particularly
egregious variety of {bigot}, those who believe that the marginality of their
preferred machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for
without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent superiority of their beloved
shining jewel of a platform would obviously win over all, market pressures be
damned!) Those afflicted are prone to engaging in {flame war}s and calling
for boycotts and mailbombings. Amiga Persecution Complex is by no means
limited to Amiga users; NeXT, {NeWS}, {OS/2}, Macintosh, {LISP}, and {GNU}
users are also common victims. {Linux} users used to display symptoms very
frequently before Linux started winning; some still do. see also {newbie},
{troll}, {holy wars}, {weenie}, {Get a life!}. :amoeba: n. Humorous term for
the Commodore Amiga personal computer. :amp off: vt. [Purdue] To run in
{background}. From the Unix shell `&' operator. :amper: n. Common
abbreviation for the name of the ampersand (`&', ASCII 0100110) character.
see {{ASCII}} for other synonyms. :angle brackets: n. Either of the
characters `<' (ASCII 0111100) and `>' (ASCII 0111110) (ASCII less-than or
greater-than signs). Typographers in the {Real World} use angle brackets
which are either taller and slimmer (the ISO `Bra' and `Ket' characters), or
significantly smaller (single or double guillemets) than the less-than and
greater-than signs. see {broket}, {{ASCII}}. :angry fruit salad: n. A bad
visual-interface design that uses too many colors. (This term derives, of
course, from the bizarre day-glo colors found in canned fruit salad.) Too
often one sees similar effects from interface designers using color window
systems such as {X}; there is a tendency to create displays that are flashy
and attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term use. :annoybot:
/*-noy-bot/ n. [IRC] see {bot}. :annoyware: n. A type of {shareware} that
frequently disrupts normal program operation to display requests for payment
to the author in return for the ability to disable the request messages.
(Also called `nagware') The requests generally require user action to
acknowledge the message before normal operation is resumed and are often tied
to the most frequently used features of the software. see also {careware},
{charityware}, {crippleware}, {freeware}, {FRS}, {guiltware}, {postcardware},
and {-ware}; compare {payware}. :ANSI: /an'see/ 1. n. [techspeak] The
American National Standards Institute. ANSI, along with the International
Organization for Standards (ISO), standardized the C programming language
(see {K&R}, {Classic C}), and promulgates many other important software
standards. 2. n. [techspeak] A terminal may be said to be `ANSI' if it meets
the ANSI X.364 standard for terminal control. Unfortunately, this standard
was both over-complicated and too permissive. It has been retired and
replaced by the ECMA-48 standard, which shares both flaws. 3. n. [BBS jargon]
The set of screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept.
This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on an MS-DOS
computer to view such codes. Unfortunately, neither DOS ANSI nor the BBS
ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X.364 terminal standard. For
example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold highlight on large machines, but
in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on `intense' (bright) colors. Also, in
BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is often used to imply that a particular computer
uses or can emulate the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS. Particular
use depends on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set is used
with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM characters' tend to go
together. :ANSI standard pizza: /an'see stan'd*rd peet'z*/ [CMU] Pepperoni
and mushroom pizza. Coined allegedly because most pizzas ordered by
