 MS-DOS: /em-es-dos/ [MicroSoft Disk Operating System] n. A {clone} of {CP/M}
for the 8088 crufted together in six weeks by hacker Tim Paterson, who is
said to have regretted it ever since. Numerous features including vaguely
UNIX-like but rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and
pipelines were hacked into 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result, there
are two incompatible versions of many system calls, and MS-DOS programmers
can never agree on basic things like what to use as an option switch or
whether to be case-sensitive. The resulting mess is now the
highest-unit-volume OS in history. Often known simply as DOS, which annoys
people familiar with other similarly abbreviated operating systems (the name
goes back to the mid-1960s, when it was attached to IBM's first disk
operating system for the 360). Some people like to pronounce DOS as "dose",
as in "I don't work on dose, man!", or to compare it with a dose of
brain-damaging drugs. see {mess-dos}, {ill-behaved}.
