 :MS-DOS:: /M-S-dos/ n. [MicroSoft Disk Operating System] A {clone} of
{{CP/M}} for the 8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by hacker Tim Paterson at
Seattle Computer Products, who called the original QDOS (Quick and Dirty
Operating System) and is said to have regretted it ever since. Microsoft
licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for IBM on time, and the
rest is history. Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but rather
broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and pipelines, were
hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result, there are
two or more incompatible versions of many system calls, and MS-DOS
programmers can never agree on basic things like what character to use as an
option switch or whether to be case-sensitive. The resulting appalling mess
is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history. Often known simply as DOS,
which annoys people familiar with other similarly abbreviated operating
systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it was attached to IBM's
first disk operating system for the 360). The name further annoys those who
know what the term {operating system} does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more
properly a set of relatively simple interrupt services. Some people like to
pronounce DOS like "dose", as in "I don't work on dose, man!", or to compare
it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide circulation
among hackers exhorts: "MS-DOS: Just say No!"). see {mess-dos},
