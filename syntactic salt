 :syntactic salt: /n./ The opposite of {syntactic sugar}, a feature designed
to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop
the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows what's going on,
rather than to express a program action. Some programmers consider required
type declarations to be syntactic salt. A requirement to write `end if', `end
while', `end do', etc. to terminate the last block controlled by a control
construct (as opposed to just `end') would definitely be syntactic salt.
Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers'
blood pressures in an unhealthy way. Compare {candygrammar}. .
