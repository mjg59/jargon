 1. A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm, controlled by a human limb.
When these were developed for the nuclear industry in the mid-1940s they were
named after the invention described by Heinlein in the story, which he wrote
in 1942. Now known by the more generic term `telefactoring', this technology
is of intense interest to NASA for tasks like space station maintenance. 2.
At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students), this is used instead
of {foobar} as a metasyntactic variable and general nonsense word. see {foo},
{bar}, {foobar}, {quux}. :walk: n.,vt. Traversal of a data structure,
especially an array or linked-list data structure in {core}. see also
{codewalker}, {silly walk}, {clobber}. :walk off the end of: vt. To run past
the end of an array, list, or medium after stepping through it -- a good way
to land in trouble. Often the result of an {off-by-one error}. Compare
{clobber}, {roach}, {smash the stack}. :walking drives: n. An occasional
failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when they were huge,
clunky {washing machine}s. Those old {dinosaur} parts carried terrific
angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to `walk' across
a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of millimeters at a time.
There is a legend about a drive that walked over to the only door to the
computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in
order to get at it! Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of
drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a
slow seek in the other direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out
how to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive
models and held disk-drive races. :wall: interj. [WPI] 1. An indication of
confusion, usually spoken with a quizzical tone: "Wall??" 2. A request for
further explication. Compare {octal forty}. 3. [Unix, from `write all'] v. To
send a message to everyone currently logged in, esp. with the wall(8)
utility. It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom `like talking to a blank
wall'. It was originally used in situations where, after you had carefully
answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly, clearly having
understood nothing that was explained. You would then throw out a "Hello,
wall?" to elicit some sort of response from the questioner. Later, confused
questioners began voicing "Wall?" themselves. :wall follower: n. A person or
algorithm that compensates for lack of sophistication or native stupidity by
efficiently following some simple procedure shown to have been effective in
the past. Used of an algorithm, this is not necessarily pejorative; it
recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the winning robot in an early AI contest (named,
of course, after the cocktail). Harvey successfully solved mazes by keeping a
`finger' on one wall and running till it came out the other end. This was
inelegant, but it was mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected
mazes -- and, in fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that
tried to `learn' each maze by building an internal representation of it. Used
of humans, the term _is_ pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic,
by-the-book mentality. see also {code grinder}; compare {droid}. :wall time:
n. (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world' time (what the clock on the wall
shows), as opposed to the system clock's idea of time. 2. The real running
time of a program, as opposed to the number of {tick}s required to execute it
(on a timesharing system these always differ, as no one program gets all the
ticks, and on multiprocessor systems with good thread support one may get
more processor time than real time). :wall wart: n. A small power-supply
brick with integral male plug, designed to plug directly into a wall outlet;
called a `wart' because when installed on a power strip it tends to block up
at least one more socket than it uses.. These are frequently associated with
modems and other small electronic devices which would become unacceptably
bulky or hot if they had power supplies on board (there are other reasons as
well having to do with the cost of UL certification). :wallpaper: n. 1. A
file containing a listing (e.g., assembly listing) or a transcript, esp. a
file containing a transcript of all or part of a login session. (The idea was
that the paper for such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper, as
evidenced at Stanford, where it was used to cover windows.) Now rare, esp.
since other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on
TWENEX). However, the Unix world doesn't have an equivalent term, so perhaps
{wallpaper} will take hold there. The term probably originated on ITS, where
the commands to begin and end transcript files were `:WALBEG' and `:WALEND',
with default file `WALL PAPER' (the space was a path delimiter). 2. The
background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is techspeak under
the `Windows' graphical user interface to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The
file that contains the wallpaper information before it is actually printed on
paper. (Even if you don't intend ever to produce a real paper copy of the
file, it is still called a wallpaper file.) :wango: /wang'goh/ n. Random
bit-level {grovel}ling going on in a system during some unspecified
operation. Often used in combination with {mumble}. For example: "You start
with the `.o' file, run it through this postprocessor that does mumble-wango
-- and it comes out a snazzy object-oriented executable." :wank: /wangk/
n.,v.,adj. [Columbia University: prob. by mutation from Commonwealth slang v.
`wank', to masturbate] Used much as {hack} is elsewhere, as a noun denoting a
clever technique or person or the result of such cleverness. May describe
(negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake ("Quit wanking, let's go
get supper!") or (more positively) a {wizard}. Adj. `wanky' describes
something particularly clever (a person, program, or algorithm).
Conversations can also get wanky when there are too many wanks involved. This
excess wankiness is signalled by an overload of the `wankometer' (compare
{bogometer}). When the wankometer overloads, the conversation's subject must
be changed, or all non-wanks will leave. Compare `neep-neeping' (under
{neep-neep}). Usage: U.S. only. In Britain and the Commonwealth this word is
_extremely_ rude and is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.
Adjectival `wanky' is less offensive and simply means `stupid' or `broken'
(this is mainstream in Great Britain). :wannabee: /won'*-bee/ n. (also, more
plausibly, spelled `wannabe') [from a term recently used to describe Madonna
fans who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob. originally from biker
slang] A would-be {hacker}. The connotations of this term differ sharply
depending on the age and exposure of the subject. Used of a person who is in
or might be entering {larval stage}, it is semi-approving; such wannabees can
be annoying but most hackers remember that they, too, were once such
creatures. When used of any professional programmer, CS academic, writer, or
{suit}, it is derogatory, implying that said person is trying to cuddle up to
the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a prayer of
understanding what it is all about. Overuse of terms from this lexicon is
often an indication of the {wannabee} nature. Compare {newbie}. Historical
note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different flavor now (1993) than
it did ten or fifteen years ago. When the people who are now hackerdom's
tribal elders were in {larval stage}, the process of becoming a hacker was
largely unconscious and unaffected by models known in popular culture --
communities formed spontaneously around people who, _as individuals_, felt
irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees experienced was
a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become similarly wizardly. Those days
of innocence are gone forever; society's adaptation to the advent of the
microcomputer after 1980 included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind
of folk hero, and the result is that some people semi-consciously set out to
_be hackers_ and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image of
hackers. Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually become a
wizard. Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated
disquiet about the change; among other things, it gives them mixed feelings
about the effects of public compendia of lore like this one. :war dialer: n.
A cracking tool, a program that calls a given list or range of phone numbers
and records those which answer with handshake tones (and so might be entry
points to computer or telecommunications systems). Some of these programs
have become quite sophisticated, and can now detect modem, fax, or PBX tones
and log each one separately. The war dialer is one of the most important
tools in the {phreaker}'s kit. These programs evolved from early {demon
dialer}s. :-ware: suff. [from `software'] Commonly used to form jargon terms
for classes of software. For examples, see {annoyware}, {careware},
{crippleware}, {crudware}, {freeware}, {fritterware}, {guiltware},
{liveware}, {meatware}, {payware}, {psychedelicware}, {shareware},
{shelfware}, {vaporware}, {wetware}. :warez: /weirz/ n. Widely used in
{cracker} subcultures to denote cracked version of commercial software, that
is versions from which copy-protection has been stripped. Hackers recognize
this term but don't use it themselves. see {warez d00dz}, {courier}, {leech},
{elite}. :warez d00dz: /weirz doodz/ n. A substantial subculture of
{cracker}s refer to themselves as `warez d00dz'; there is evidently some
connection with {B1FF} here. As `Ozone Pilot', one former warez d00d, wrote:
Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software. If it has copy
protection on it, they break the protection so the software can be copied.
Then they distribute it around the world via several gateways. Warez d00dz
form badass group names like RAZOR and the like. They put up boards that
distribute the latest ware, or pirate program. The whole point of the Warez
sub-culture is to get the pirate program released and distributed before any
other group. I know, I know. But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much. This
is how they prove their poweress [sic]. It gives them the right to say, "I
released King's Quest IVXIX before you so obviously my testicles are larger."
Again don't ask... The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears,
is emit `0-day warez', that is copies of commercial software copied and
cracked on the same day as its retail release. Warez d00ds also hoard
software in a big way, collecting untold megabytes of arcade-style games,
pornographic JPGs, and applications they'll never use onto their hard disks.
As Ozone Pilot acutely observes: [BELONG] is the only word you will need to
know. Warez d00dz want to belong. They have been shunned by everyone, and
thus turn to cyberspace for acceptance. That is why they always start groups
like TGW, FLT, USA and the like. Structure makes them happy. [...] Warez
d00dz will never have a handle like "Pink Daisy" because warez d00dz are
insecure. Only someone who is very secure with a good dose of self-esteem can
stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man. More likely you will find warez
d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death, Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad
Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown, Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin
Turbo. They like to sound badass when they can hide behind their terminals.
More likely, if you were given a sample of 100 people, the person whose
handle is Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name. The
contrast with Internet hackers is stark and instructive. see {cracker},
{wannabee}, {handle}, {elite}, {courier}, {leech}; compare {weenie}, {spod}.
:warez kiddies: n. Even more derogatory way of referring to {warez d00dz};
refers to the fact that most warez d00dz are around the age of puberty.
Compare {script kiddies}. :warlording: v. [from the Usenet group
alt.fan.warlord] The act of excoriating a bloated, ugly, or derivative {sig
block}. Common grounds for warlording include the presence of a signature
rendered in a {BUAF}, over-used or cliched {sig quote}s, ugly {ASCII art}, or
simply excessive size. The original `Warlord' was a {B1FF}-like {newbie}
c.1991 who featured in his sig a particularly large and obnoxious ASCII
graphic resembling the sword of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius
movie; the group name alt.fan.warlord was sarcasm, and the characteristic
mode of warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise. :warm boot: n. see
{boot}. :wart: n. A small, {crock}y {feature} that sticks out of an otherwise
{clean} design. Something conspicuous for localized ugliness, especially a
special-case exception to a general rule. For example, in some versions of
`csh(1)', single quotes literalize every character inside them except `!'. In
ANSI C, the `??' syntax used for obtaining ASCII characters in a foreign
environment is a wart. see also {miswart}. :washing machine: n. 1. Old-style
14-inch hard disks in floor-standing cabinets. So called because of the size
of the cabinet and the `top-loading' access to the media packs -- and, of
course, they were always set on `spin cycle'. The washing-machine idiom
transcends language barriers; it is even used in Russian hacker jargon. see
also {walking drives}. The thick channel cables connecting these were called
`bit hoses' (see {hose}, sense 3). 2. [CMU] A machine used exclusively for
{washing software}. CMU has clusters of these. :washing software: n. The
process of recompiling a software distribution (used more often when the
recompilation is occuring from scratch) to pick up and merge together all of
the various changes that have been made to the source. :water MIPS: n. (see
{MIPS}, sense 2) Large, water-cooled machines of either today's
ECL-supercomputer flavor or yesterday's traditional {mainframe} type. :wave a
dead chicken: v. To perform a ritual in the direction of crashed software or
hardware that one believes to be futile but is nevertheless necessary so that
others are satisfied that an appropriate degree of effort has been expended.
"I'll wave a dead chicken over the source code, but I really think we've run
into an OS bug." Compare {voodoo programming}, {rain dance}; see also
{casting the runes}. :weasel: n. [Cambridge] A naive user, one who
deliberately or accidentally does things that are stupid or ill-advised.
Roughly synonymous with {loser}. :web pointer: n. A World Wide Web {URL}. see
also {hotlink}, which has slightly different connotations. :web toaster: n. A
small specialized computer, shipped with no monitor or keyboard or any other
external peripherals, pre-configured to be controlled through an Ethernet
port and function as a WWW server. Products of this kind (for example the
Cobalt Qube) are often about the size of a toaster. see {toaster}; compare
{video toaster}. :webify: n. To put a piece of (possibly already existing)
material on the WWW. Frequently used for papers ("Why don't you webify all
your publications?") or for demos ("They webified their 6.866 final
project"). This term seems to have been (rather logically) independently
invented multiple times in the early 1990s. :webmaster: n. [WWW: from
{postmaster}] The person at a site providing World Wide Web information who
is responsible for maintaining the public pages and keeping the Web server
running and properly configured. :web ring: n. Two or more web sites
connected by prominent links between sites sharing a common interest or
theme. Usually such cliques have the topology of a ring, in order to make it
easy for visitors to navigate through all of them. :wedged: adj. 1. To be
stuck, incapable of proceeding without help. This is different from having
crashed. If the system has crashed, it has become totally non-functioning. If
the system is wedged, it is trying to do something but cannot make progress;
it may be capable of doing a few things, but not be fully operational. For
example, a process may become wedged if it {deadlock}s with another (but not
all instances of wedging are deadlocks). see also {gronk}, {locked up},
{hosed}, {hung} (wedged is more severe than {hung}). 2. Often refers to
humans suffering misconceptions. "He's totally wedged -- he's convinced that
he can levitate through meditation." 3. [Unix] Specifically used to describe
the state of a TTY left in a losing state by abort of a screen-oriented
program or one that has messed with the line discipline in some obscure way.
There is some dispute over the origin of this term. It is usually thought to
derive from a common description of recto-cranial inversion; however, it may
actually have originated with older `hot-press' printing technology in which
physical type elements were locked into type frames with wedges driven in by
mallets. Once this had been done, no changes in the typesetting for that page
could be made. :wedgie: n. [Fairchild] A bug. Prob. related to {wedged}.
:wedgitude: /wedj'i-t[y]ood/ n. The quality or state of being {wedged}.
:weeble: /weeb'l/ interj. [Cambridge] Used to denote frustration, usually at
amazing stupidity. "I stuck the disk in upside down." "Weeble...." Compare
{gurfle}. :weeds: n. 1. Refers to development projects or algorithms that
have no possible relevance or practical application. Comes from `off in the
weeds'. Used in phrases like "lexical analysis for microcode is serious
weeds...." 2. At CDC/ETA before its demise, the phrase `go off in the weeds'
was equivalent to IBM's {branch to Fishkill} and mainstream hackerdom's {jump
off into never-never land}. :weenie: n. 1. [on BBSes] Any of a species of
luser resembling a less amusing version of {B1FF} that infests many {BBS}
systems. The typical weenie is a teenage boy with poor social skills
travelling under a grandiose {handle} derived from fantasy or heavy-metal
rock lyrics. Among sysops, `the weenie problem' refers to the marginally
literate and profanity-laden {flamage} weenies tend to spew all over a
newly-discovered BBS. Compare {spod}, {computer geek}, {terminal junkie},
{warez d00dz}. 2. [Among hackers] When used with a qualifier (for example, as
in {Unix weenie}, VMS weenie, IBM weenie) this can be either an insult or a
term of praise, depending on context, tone of voice, and whether or not it is
applied by a person who considers him or herself to be the same sort of
weenie. Implies that the weenie has put a major investment of time, effort,
and concentration into the area indicated; whether this is good or bad
depends on the hearer's judgment of how the speaker feels about that area.
see also {bigot}. 3. The semicolon character, `;' (ASCII 0111011). :Weenix:
/wee'niks/ n. 1. [ITS] A derogatory term for {{Unix}}, derived from {Unix
weenie}. According to one noted ex-ITSer, it is "the operating system
preferred by Unix Weenies: typified by poor modularity, poor reliability,
hard file deletion, no file version numbers, case sensitivity everywhere, and
users who believe that these are all advantages". (Some ITS fans behave as
though they believe Unix stole a future that rightfully belonged to them. see
{{ITS}}, sense 2.) 2. [Brown University] A Unix-like OS developed for
tutorial purposes at Brown University. see
`http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/weenix.html'. Named independently of
the ITS usage. :well-behaved: adj. 1. [primarily {{MS-DOS}}] Said of software
conforming to system interface guidelines and standards. Well-behaved
software uses the operating system to do chores such as keyboard input,
allocating memory and drawing graphics. Oppose {ill-behaved}.
