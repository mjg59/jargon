 ASCII art: n. The fine art of drawing diagrams using the ASCII character set
(mainly `|', `-', `/', `\', and `+'). Also known as `character graphics' or
`ASCII graphics'; see also {boxology}. Here is a serious example:
o----)||(--+--|<----+ +---------o + D O L )||( | | | C U A I )||( +-->|-+ |
+-\/\/-+--o - T C N )||( | | | | P E )||( +-->|-+--)---+--)|--+-o U )||( | |
| GND T o----)||(--+--|<----+----------+ A power supply consisting of a full
wave rectifier circuit feeding a capacitor input filter circuit Figure 1. And
here are some very silly examples: |\/\/\/| ____/| ___ |\_/| ___ | | \ o.O|
ACK! / \_ |` '| _/ \ | | =(_)= THPHTH! / \/ \/ \ | (o)(o) U / \ C _) (__)
\/\/\/\ _____ /\/\/\/ | ,___| (oo) \/ \/ | / \/-------\ U (__) /____\ || | \
/---V `v'- oo ) / \ ||---W|| * * |--| || |`. |_/\ Figure 2. There is an
important subgenre of humorous ASCII art that takes advantage of the names of
the various characters to tell a pun-based joke.

an entire flourishing subgenre of pictures of silly cows. Four of these are
reproduced in Figure 2; here are three more: (__) (__) (__) (\/) ($$) (**)

love Figure 4. attoparsec: n. `atto-' is the standard SI prefix for
multiplication by 10^{-18}. A parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years;
an attoparsec is thus 3.26 * 10^{-18} light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
attoparsec/{microfortnight} equals about 1 inch/sec). This unit is reported
to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among hackers in the U.K.
see {micro-}. autobogotiphobia: /aw'to-boh-got`*-foh'bee-*/ n. see
{bogotify}. automagically: /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ or /aw-toh-maj'i-k*l-ee/ adv.
Automatically, but in a way that, for some reason (typically because it is
too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker
doesn't feel like explaining to you. see {magic}. "The C-INTERCAL compiler
generates C, then automagically invokes `cc(1)' to produce an executable."
avatar: [CMU, Tektronix] n. Syn. {root}, {superuser}. There are quite a few
UNIX machines on which the name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather
than `root'. This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who disliked the term
`superuser', and was propagated through an ex-CMU hacker at Tektronix. awk:
1. n. [UNIX techspeak] An interpreted language for massaging text data
developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan (the name is
from their initials). It is characterized by C-like syntax, a
declaration-free approach to variable typing and declarations, associative
arrays, and field-oriented text processing. see also {Perl}. 2. n. Editing
term for an expression awkward to manipulate through normal {regexp}
facilities (for example, one containing a {newline}). 3. vt. To process data
using `awk(1)'. = B = ===== back door: n. A hole in the security of a system
deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers. The motivation for
this is not always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of
the box with privileged accounts intended for use by field service
technicians or the vendor's maintenance programmers. Historically, back doors
have often lurked in systems longer than anyone expected or planned, and a
few have become widely known. The infamous {RTM} worm of late 1988, for
example, used a back door in the {BSD} UNIX `sendmail(8)' utility. Ken
Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM revealed the existence of a
back door in early UNIX versions that may have qualified as the most
fiendishly clever security hack of all time. The C compiler contained code
that would recognize when the `login' command was being recompiled and insert
some code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to the
system whether or not an account had been created for him. Normally such a
back door could be removed by removing it from the source code for the
compiler and recompiling the compiler. But to recompile the compiler, you
have to *use* the compiler --- so Thompson also arranged that the compiler
would *recognize when it was compiling a version of itself*, and insert into
the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the recompiled `login' the
code to allow Thompson entry --- and, of course, the code to recognize itself
and do the whole thing again the next time around! And having done this once,
he was then able to recompile the compiler from the original sources, leaving
his back door in place and active but with no trace in the sources. The talk
that revealed this truly moby hack was published as "Reflections on Trusting
Trust", `Communications of the ACM 27', 8 (August 1984), pp. 761--763. Syn.
{trap door}; may also be called a `wormhole'. see also {iron box}, {cracker},
{worm}, {logic bomb}. backbone cabal: n. A group of large-site administrators
who pushed through the {Great Renaming} and reined in the chaos of {USENET}
during most of the 1980s. The cabal {mailing list} disbanded in late 1988
after a bitter internal catfight, but the net hardly noticed. backbone site:
n. A key USENET and email site; one that processes a large amount of
third-party traffic, especially if it is the home site of any of the regional
coordinators for the USENET maps. Notable backbone sites as of early 1991
include uunet and the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, DEC's
Western Research Laboratories, Ohio State University, and the University of
Texas. Compare {rib site}, {leaf site}. backgammon:: see {bignum}, {moby},
and {pseudoprime}. background: n.,adj.,vt. To do a task `in background' is to
do it whenever {foreground} matters are not claiming your undivided
attention, and `to background' something means to relegate it to a lower
priority. "For now, we'll just print a list of nodes and links; I'm working
on the graph-printing problem in background." Note that this implies ongoing
activity but at a reduced level or in spare time, in contrast to mainstream
`back burner' (which connotes benign neglect until some future resumption of
activity). Some people prefer to use the term for processing that they have
queued up for their unconscious minds (a tack that one can often fruitfully
take upon encountering an obstacle in creative work). Compare {amp off},
{slopsucker}. Technically, a task running in background is detached from the
terminal where it was started (and often running at a lower priority); oppose
{foreground}. Nowadays this term is primarily associated with {{UNIX}}, but
it appears to have been first used in this sense on OS/360. backspace and
overstrike: interj. Whoa! Back up. Used to suggest that someone just said or
did something wrong. Common among APL programmers. backward combatability:
/bak'w*rd k*m-bat'*-bil'*-tee/ [from `backward compatibility'] n. A property
of hardware or software revisions in which previous protocols, formats, and
layouts are discarded in favor of `new and improved' protocols, formats, and
layouts. Occurs usually when making the transition between major releases.
When the change is so drastic that the old formats are not retained in the
new version, it is said to be `backward combatable'. see {flag day}.
