 :ASCII:: /as'kee/ n. [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant
character set encoding of present-day computers. The standard version uses 7
bits for each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts
of ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion of
lowercase letters -- a major {win} -- but it did not provide for accented
letters or any other letterforms not used in English (such as the German
sharp-S or the ae-ligature which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian). It
could be worse, though. It could be much worse. see {{EBCDIC}} to understand
how. A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at
`http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html'. Computers are much pickier and
less flexible about spelling than humans; thus, hackers need to be very
precise when talking about characters, and have developed a considerable
amount of verbal shorthand for them. Every character has one or more names --
some formal, some concise, some silly. Common jargon names for ASCII
characters are collected here. see also individual entries for {bang},
{excl}, {open}, {ques}, {semi}, {shriek}, {splat}, {twiddle}, and {Yu-Shiang
Whole Fish}. This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII
pronunciation guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character
pairs are sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are
given in rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but
rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: <>. Square
brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by {INTERCAL}. The
abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and "open/close"
respectively. Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage information. !

swung dash; enyay; [sqiggle (sic)]. The pronunciation of `#' as `pound' is
common in the U.S. but a bad idea; {{Commonwealth Hackish}} has its own,
rather more apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards
the pound graphic happens to replace `#'; thus Britishers sometimes call `#'
on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the American error). The U.S.
usage derives from an old-fashioned commercial practice of using a `#' suffix
to tag pound weights on bills of lading. The character is usually pronounced
`hash' outside the U.S. There are more culture wars over the correct
pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to the {ha ha
only serious} suggestion that it be pronounced `shibboleth' (see Judges 12:6
in an Old Testament or Tanakh). The `uparrow' name for circumflex and
`leftarrow' name for underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the
1963 version), which had these graphics in those character positions rather
than the modern punctuation characters. The `swung dash' or `approximation'
sign is not quite the same as tilde in typeset material but the ASCII tilde
serves for both (compare {angle brackets}). Some other common usages cause
odd overlaps. The `#', `$', `>', and `&' characters, for example, are all
pronounced "hex" in different communities because various assemblers use them
as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in particular, `#' in many
assembler-programming cultures, `$' in the 6502 world, `>' at Texas
Instruments, and `&' on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines). see
also {splat}. The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more
and more like a serious {misfeature} as the use of international networks
continues to increase (see {software rot}). Hardware and software from the
U.S. still tends to embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal
character set and that characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to
people who want to use a character set suited to their own languages.
Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating `national'
character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a _smaller_ subset
common to all those in use.
