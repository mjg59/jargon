 9394 lines, 75954 words, 490501 chars, and 1046 entries. Version 2.3.1, Jan
03 1991: the great format change --- case is no longer smashed in lexicon
keys and cross-references. A very few entries from jargon-1 which were
basically straight tech-speak were deleted; this enabled the rest of Appendix
B to be merged back into main text and the appendix replaced with the
Portrait of J. Random Hacker. More USENET submissions were added. This
version had 10728 lines, 85070 words, 558261 characters, and 1138 entries.
Version 2.4.1, Jan 14 1991: the Story of Mel and many more USENET submissions
merged in. More material on hackish writing habits added. Numerous typo
fixes. This version had 12362 lines, 97819 words, 642899 characters, and 1239
entries. Version numbering: Read versions as <major>.<minor>.<revision>.
Major version 1 is reserved for the `old' (ITS) Jargon File, jargon-1. Major
version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR with assistance from GLS. Someday, the
next maintainer will take over and spawn `version 3'. In general, later
versions will either completely obsolesce or incorporate earlier versions, so
there is generally no point in keeping old versions around. Our thanks to the
other co-authors of Steele-1983 for oversight and assistance; also to all the
USENETters who contributed entries and encouragement. Special thanks go to
our Scandinavian correspondent Per Lindberg (per@front.se), author of the
remarkable Swedish language 'zine `Hackerbladet', for bringing FOO! comics to
our attention and smuggling the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon file
out to us. Also, much gratitude to ace hacker/linguist Joe Keane
(jkg@osc.osc.com) for helping us improve the pronunciation guides; and to
Maarten Litmath for generously allowing the inclusion of the ASCII
pronunciation guide he formerly maintained. Finally, Mark Brader
(msb@sq.sq.com) submitted many thoughtful comments and did yeoman service in
catching typos and minor usage bobbles. Format For New Entries
====================== Try to conform to the format already being used ---
definitions and cross-references in angle brackets, pronunciations in
slashes, etymologies in square brackets, single-space after definition
numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the standard ASCII character set (no
high-half characters or [nt]roff/TeX/Scribe escapes), as one of the versions
generated from the master file is an info document that has to be viewable on
a character tty. Please note that as of 2.3.1 the preferred format has
changed rather dramatically; please *don't* all-caps your entry keys any
more. Besides preserving case information, this enables the maintainers to
process the File into a rather spiffy [nt]roff document with font switches
via an almost trivial lex(1) program. This is all in aid of preventing the
freely-available on-line document and the book from diverging. We are looking
to expand the file's range of technical specialties covered. There are
doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the scientific computing,
graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in numerical analysis,
computer architectures and VLSI design, language design, and many other
related fields. Send us your slang! We are *not* interested in straight
technical terms explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an
entry illuminates `underground' meanings or aspects not covered by official
histories. We are also not interested in `joke' entries --- there is a lot of
humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations of what
hackers do and how they think. It is OK to submit items of slang you have
originated if they have spread to the point of being used by people who are
not personally acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by
independent submission from two different sites.
