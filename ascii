 ASCII:: [American Standard Code for Information Interchange] /as'kee/ n. The
predominant character set encoding of present-day computers. Uses 7 bits for
each character, whereas most earlier codes (including one version of ASCII)
used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion of lowercase letters, a major
{win} --- but it did not provide for accented letters or any other
letterforms not used in English (such as the German esszett and the
ae-ligature used in Norwegian and some other languages). It could be worse,
though. It could be much worse. see {{EBCDIC}} to understand how. Common
jargon names for ASCII characters are collected here. see individual entries
for {bang}, {excl}, {open}, {ques}, {semi}, {shriek}, {splat}, {twiddle},
{what}, and {Yu-Shiang Whole Fish}. This list derives from revision 2.2 of
the USENET ASCII pronunciation guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII
order; character pairs are sorted in by first member. For each character,
common names are given in rough order of popularity followed by names which
are reported but rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are parenthesized.
Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by {INTERCAL}.

pronunciation of `#' as `pound' is common in the U.S. but a bad idea;
{{Commonwealth Hackish}} has its own rather more apposite use of `pound sign'
(confusingly, on British keyboards the pound graphic happens to replace `#';
thus Britishers sometimes call `#' on a US-ASCII keyboard `pound',
compounding the American error). The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned
commercial practice of using a `#' suffix to tag pound weights on bills of
lading. The character is usually pronounced `hash' outside the U.S. Also note
that the `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same as tilde
in typeset material but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare {angle
brackets}). Some other common usages cause odd overlaps. The `#', `$', `>',
and `&' chars, for example, are all pronounced "hex" in different communities
because various assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants
(in particular, `$' in the 6502 world, `>' at Texas Instruments, and `&' on
the Sinclair and some other Z80 machines). The inability of ASCII text to
correctly represent any of the world's other major languages makes the
designers' choice of 7 bits look more and more like a serious {misfeature} as
the use of international networks continues to increase (see {software rot}).
The assumption, which continues to be embedded in hardware and software from
the US, that ASCII is the *universal* character set, is a now a major
irritant to people who want to use a character set suited to their own
language. attoparsec: n. `atto-' is the official SI prefix for multiplication
by 10 ^ -18, a parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is
thus 3.26e-18 light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
attoparsec/{microfortnight} equals about 1 inch/sec). This unit is reported
to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among hackers in Great
Britain. see {micro-} autobogotiphobia: /aw'to-boh-got'@-foh`bee-uh/ n. see
{bogotify}. automagically: /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ or /aw-toh-maj'i-k@l-ee/ adv.
Automatically, but in a way which, for some reason (typically because it is
too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker
doesn't feel like explaining to you. see {magic}. "The C-INTERCAL compiler
generates C, then automagically invokes `cc(1)' to produce an executable."
awk: 1. n. [UNIX techspeak] An interpreted language developed by Aho,
Weinberg, and Kernighan (the name is from their initials). It is
characterized by: C-like syntax, a BASIC-like approach to variable typing and
declarations, associative arrays, and field-oriented text processing. see
also {Perl}. 2. n. Editing term for an expression awkward to manipulate
through normal regular expression facilities. 3. vt. To process data using
`awk(1)'. = B = ===== back door: n. A hole in the security of a system
deliberately left in place by designers or maintainers. The motivation for
this is not always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of
the box with privileged accounts intended for use by field service or the
vendor's maintenance programmers. Historically, back doors have often lurked
in systems longer than anyone expected or planned, and a few have become
widely known. The infamous RTM worm of late 1988, for example, used a back
door in the {BSD} UNIX `sendmail(8)' utility. Ken Thompson's 1983 Turing
Award lecture to the ACM revealed the existence of a back door in early UNIX
versions that may have qualified as the most fiendishly clever security hack
of all time. The binaries of the C compiler had code in them which would
automatically patch itself into the output executable whenever the compiler
itself was being recompiled, and also patch the `login' command, when *it*
was being recompiled, to accept a password that gave Thompson entry to the
computer whether or not an account had been created for him! Thompson
describes this hack as a {Trojan horse}. This talk was published as
`Reflections on Trusting Trust', Communications of the ACM 27,8 (August 1984)
pp. 761-763. Although Thompson didn't say whether the hacked version ever
made it off site, it is commonly believed that this back door was in fact
propagated through hundreds of machines without any clue to it ever showing
up in source. Syn. {trap door}; may also be called a `wormhole'. see also
{iron box}, {cracker}, {worm}, {logic bomb}. backbone cabal: n. A group of
large-site administrators who pushed through the {Great Renaming} and reined
in the chaos of {USENET} during most of the 1980s. The cabal {mailing list}
disbanded in late 1988 after a bitter internal catfight, but the net hardly
noticed. backbone site: n. A key USENET and email site; one which processes a
large amount of third-party traffic, especially if it's the home site of any
of the regional coordinators for the USENET maps. Notable backbone sites as
of early 1991 include `uunet' and the mail machines at Rutgers University, UC
Berkeley, DEC's Western Research Laboratories, Ohio State University, and the
University of Texas. Compare {rib site}, {leaf site}. backgammon:: see
{bignum}, {moby}, and {pseudoprime}. background: n.,adj. 1. [techspeak] A
task running in background is detached from the terminal where it was started
(and often running at a lower priority); oppose {foreground}. Nowadays this
term is primarily associated with {UNIX}, but it appears first to have been
used in this sense on OS/360. 2. By extension, to do a task `in background'
is to do it whenever {foreground} matters are not claiming your undivided
attention, and `to background' something means to relegate it to a lower
priority. Note that this implies ongoing activity but at a reduced level or
in spare time, in contrast to mainstream `back burner' which connotes benign
neglect until some future resumption of activity. Some people prefer to use
the term for processing that they've queued up for their unconscious minds (a
tack that one can often fruitfully take when encountering an obstacle in
creative work). Compare {amp off}, {slopsucker}. backspace and overstrike:
interj. Whoa! Back up. Used to suggest that someone just said or did
something wrong. Common among APL programmers. backward combatability:
/bak'w@rd k@m-bat'@-bil'@-tee/ [corruption of "backward compatibility"] adj.
A property pertaining to hardware or software in which all previous
protocols, formats, and layouts are discarded in favor of the `new and
improved' protocols, formats, and layouts. Occurs usually when making the
transition between major releases. When the change is so drastic that the old
formats are not retained in the new version, it is said to be `backward
combatable'. see {flag day}.
