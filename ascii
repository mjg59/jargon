 :ASCII: /as´kee/, n. [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for
Information Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant
character set encoding of present-day computers. The standard version uses 7
bits for each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts
of ASCII prior to June 1961) used fewer. This change allowed the inclusion of
lowercase letters -- a major {win} -- but it did not provide for accented
letters or any other letterforms not used in English (such as the German
sharp-S ß. or the ae-ligature æ which is a letter in, for example,
Norwegian). It could be worse, though. It could be much worse. see {EBCDIC}
to understand how. A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at
http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html. Computers are much pickier and
less flexible about spelling than humans; thus, hackers need to be very
precise when talking about characters, and have developed a considerable
amount of verbal shorthand for them. Every character has one or more names --
some formal, some concise, some silly. Common jargon names for ASCII
characters are collected here. see also individual entries for {bang},
{excl}, {open}, {ques}, {semi}, {shriek}, {splat}, {twiddle}, and {Yu-Shiang
Whole Fish}. This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII
pronunciation guide. Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character
pairs are sorted in by first member. For each character, common names are
given in rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but
rarely seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: <>. Square
brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by {INTERCAL}. The
abbreviations "l/r" and "o/c" stand for left/right and "open/close"
respectively. Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage information. !
