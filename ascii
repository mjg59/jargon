 ASCII pronunciation guide he formerly maintained. Finally, Mark Brader
(msb@sq.sq.com) submitted many, many K of thoughtful comments and did yeoman
service in catching typos and minor usage bobbles. Format For New Entries
====================== Try to conform to the format already being used ---
definitions and cross-references in angle brackets, pronunciations in
slashes, etymologies in square brackets, single-space after definition
numbers and word classes, etc. Stick to the standard ASCII character set (no
high-half characters or [nt]roff/TeX/Scribe escapes), as one of the versions
generated from the master file is an info document that has to be viewable on
a character tty. Please note that as of 2.3.1 the preferred format has
changed rather dramatically; please *don't* all-caps your entry keys any
more. Besides preserving case information, this enables the maintainers to
process the File into a rather spiffy [nt]roff document with font switches
via an almost trivial lex(1) program. This is all in aid of preventing the
freely-available on-line document and the book from diverging. We are looking
to expand the file's range of technical specialties covered. There are
doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the scientific computing,
graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in numerical analysis,
computer architectures and VLSI design, language design, and many other
related fields. Send us your slang! We are *not* interested in straight
technical terms explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an
entry illuminates "underground" meanings or aspects not covered by official
histories. We are also not interested in "joke" entries --- there is a lot of
humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the explanations of what
hackers do and how they think. It is OK to submit items of slang you have
originated if they have spread to the point of being used by people who are
not personally acquainted with you. We prefer items to be attested by
independent submission from two different sites.
