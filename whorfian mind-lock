 :Whorfian mind-lock: [from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are
often restricted in unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating
system or hardware they have to work with. Sometimes they are restricted in
avoidable ways by mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular
language or environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded.
When a design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit
that is no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian
mind-lock. The design itself has been `whorfed'. For example, some Unix
designs are whorfed by the assumption that directory searches are linear and
expensive for large directories; therefore directories must be kept small.
Another common way to succumb to Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial
processing with a small working set rather than slurping an entire file or
data structure into memory; the hidden assumption here is that not much core
is available and virtual memory works poorly if at all. Detecting Whorfian
mind-lock is important, because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity
and bugs.
