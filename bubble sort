 :bubble sort: n. Techspeak for a particular sorting technique in which pairs
of adjacent values in the list to be sorted are compared and interchanged if
they are out of order; thus, list entries `bubble upward' in the list until
they bump into one with a lower sort value. Because it is not very good
relative to other methods and is the one typically stumbled on by {naive} and
untutored programmers, hackers consider it the {canonical} example of a naive
algorithm. (However, it's been shown by repeated experiment that below about
5000 records bubble-sort is OK anyway.) The canonical example of a really bad
algorithm is {bogo-sort}. A bubble sort might be used out of ignorance, but
any use of bogo-sort could issue only from brain damage or willful
perversity.
