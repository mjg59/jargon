 :cargo cult programming: /n./ A style of (incompetent) programming dominated
by ritual inclusion of code or program structures that serve no real purpose.
A cargo cult programmer will usually explain the extra code as a way of
working around some bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug
nor the reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully understood
(compare {shotgun debugging}, {voodoo programming}). The term `cargo cult' is
a reference to aboriginal religions that grew up in the South Pacific after
World War II. The practices of these cults center on building elaborate
mockups of airplanes and military style landing strips in the hope of
bringing the return of the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous
cargo during the war. Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in his book
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" (W. W. Norton & Co, New York 1985, ISBN
0-393-01921-7).
