 :toy: /n./ A computer system; always used with qualifiers. 1. `nice toy':
One that supports the speaker's hacking style adequately. 2. `just a toy': A
machine that yields insufficient {computron}s for the speaker's preferred
uses. This is not condemnatory, as is {bitty box}; toys can at least be fun.
It is also strongly conditioned by one's expectations; Cray XMP users
sometimes consider the Cray-1 a `toy', and certainly all RISC boxes and
mainframes are toys by their standards. see also {Get a real computer!}.
