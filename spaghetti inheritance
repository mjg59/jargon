 :spaghetti inheritance: n. [encountered among users of object-oriented
languages that use inheritance, such as Smalltalk] A convoluted
class-subclass graph, often resulting from carelessly deriving subclasses
from other classes just for the sake of reusing their code. Coined in a
(successful) attempt to discourage such practice, through
guilt-by-association with {spaghetti code}.
