 :iron box: [UNIX/Internet] n. A special environment set up to trap a
{cracker} logging in over remote connections long enough to be traced. May
include a modified {shell} restricting the cracker's movements in unobvious
ways, and `bait' files designed to keep him interested and logged on. see
also {back door}, {firewall machine}, {Venus flytrap}, and Clifford Stoll's
account in "{The Cuckoo's Egg}" of how he made and used one (see the
Bibliography in appendix C). Compare {padded cell}.
