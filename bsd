 BSD utility `biff(1)', which was in turn named after a friendly dog who used
to chase frisbees in the halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in development. There
was a legend that it had a habit of barking whenever the mailman came, but
the author of `biff' says this is not true. No relation to {B1FF}. :Big Gray
Wall: n. What faces a {VMS} user searching for documentation. A full VMS kit
comes on a pallet, the documentation taking up around 15 feet of shelf space
before the addition of layered products such as compilers, databases,
multivendor networking, and programming tools. Recent (since VMS version 5)
documentation comes with gray binders; under VMS version 4 the binders were
orange (`big orange wall'), and under version 3 they were blue. see {VMS}.
Often contracted to `Gray Wall'. :big iron: n. Large, expensive, ultra-fast
computers. Used generally of {number-crunching} supercomputers such as Crays,
but can include more conventional big commercial IBMish mainframes. Term of
approval; compare {heavy metal}, oppose {dinosaur}. :Big Red Switch: n. [IBM]
The power switch on a computer, esp. the `Emergency Pull' switch on an IBM
{mainframe} or the power switch on an IBM PC where it really is large and
red. "This !@%$% {bitty box} is hung again; time to hit the Big Red Switch."
Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the company's passion for {TLA}s,
this is often abbreviated as `BRS' (this has also become established on
FidoNet and in the PC {clone} world). It is alleged that the emergency pull
switch on an IBM 360/91 actually fired a non-conducting bolt into the main
power feed; the BRSes on more recent mainframes physically drop a block into
place so that they can't be pushed back in. People get fired for pulling
them, especially inappropriately (see also {molly-guard}). Compare {power
cycle}, {three-finger salute}, {120 reset}; see also {scram switch}. :Big
Room: n. The extremely large room with the blue ceiling and intensely bright
light (during the day) or black ceiling with lots of tiny night-lights
(during the night) found outside all computer installations. "He can't come
to the phone right now, he's somewhere out in the Big Room." :big win: n.
Serendipity. "Yes, those two physicists discovered high-temperature
superconductivity in a batch of ceramic that had been prepared incorrectly
according to their experimental schedule. Small mistake; big win!" see {win
big}. :big-endian: adj. [From Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" via the famous
paper "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace" by Danny Cohen,
