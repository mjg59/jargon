 :BSD: /B-S-D/ n. [abbreviation for `Berkeley Software Distribution'] a
family of {{UNIX}} versions for the {DEC} {VAX} and PDP-11 developed by Bill
Joy and others at {Berzerkeley} starting around 1980, incorporating paged
virtual memory, TCP/IP networking enhancements, and many other features. The
BSD versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) and the commercial versions derived from
them (SunOS, ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held the technical lead in the UNIX world
until AT&T's successful standardization efforts after about 1986, and are
still widely popular. Note that BSD versions going back to 2.9 are often
referred to by their version numbers, without the BSD prefix. see {4.2},
{{UNIX}}, {USG UNIX}.
