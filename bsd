 :BSD: /B-S-D/ n. [abbreviation for `Berkeley System Distribution'] a family
of {{UNIX}} versions for the {DEC} {VAX} and PDP-11 developed by Bill Joy and
others at {Berzerkeley} starting around 1980, incorporating paged virtual
memory, TCP/IP networking enhancements, and many other features. The BSD
versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) and the commercial versions derived from them
(SunOS, ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held the technical lead in the UNIX world until
AT&T's successful standardization efforts after about 1986, and are still
widely popular. see {{UNIX}}, {USG UNIX}.
