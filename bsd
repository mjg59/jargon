 :BSD: /B-S-D/ n. [abbreviation for `Berkeley Software Distribution'] a
family of {{Unix}} versions for the {DEC} {VAX} and PDP-11 developed by Bill
Joy and others at {Berzerkeley} starting around 1977, incorporating paged
virtual memory, TCP/IP networking enhancements, and many other features. The
BSD versions (4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) and the commercial versions derived from
them (SunOS, ULTRIX, and Mt. Xinu) held the technical lead in the Unix world
until AT&T's successful standardization efforts after about 1986; descendants
including Free/Open/NetBSD, BSD/OS and MacOS X are still widely popular. Note
that BSD versions going back to 2.9 are often referred to by their version
numbers alone, without the BSD prefix. see {4.2}, and {{Unix}}.
