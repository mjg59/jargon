 :micros~1: An abbreviation of the full name {Microsoft} resembling the
rather {bogus} way Windows 9x's VFAT filesystem truncates long file names to
fit in the MS-DOS 8+3 scheme (the real filename is stored elsewhere). If
other files start with the same prefix, they'll be called micros~2 and so on,
causing lots of problems with backups and other routine system-administration
problems. During the US Antitrust trial against Microsoft the names Micros~1
and Micros~2 were suggested for the two companies that would exist after a
break-up.
