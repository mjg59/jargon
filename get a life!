 :Get a life!: imp. Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the person to whom
it is directed has succumbed to terminal geekdom (see {geek}). Often heard on
{Usenet}, esp. as a way of suggesting that the target is taking some obscure
issue of {theology} too seriously. This exhortation was popularized by
William Shatner on a 1987 "Saturday Night Live" episode in a speech that
ended "Get a _life_!", but some respondents believe it to have been in use
before then. It was certainly in wide use among hackers for years before
achieving mainstream currency via the sitcom "Get A Life" in 1990.
