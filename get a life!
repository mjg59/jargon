 :Get a life!: /imp./ Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the person to
whom it is directed has succumbed to terminal geekdom (see {computer geek}).
Often heard on {Usenet}, esp. as a way of suggesting that the target is
taking some obscure issue of {theology} too seriously. This exhortation was
popularized by William Shatner on a "Saturday Night Live" episode in a speech
that ended "Get a *life*!", but some respondents believe it to have been in
use before then. It was certainly in wide use among hackers for at least five
years before achieving mainstream currency in early 1992.
