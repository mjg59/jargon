 :Black Screen of Death: [prob.: related to the Floating Head of Death in a
famous Far Side cartoon.] A failure mode of {Microsloth Windows}. On an
attempt to launch a DOS box, a networked Windows system not uncommonly blanks
the screen and locks up the PC so hard that it requires a cold {boot} to
recover. This unhappy phenomenon is known as The Black Screen of Death. see
also {Blue Screen of Death}, which has become rather more common.
