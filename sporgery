 :sporgery: [portmanteau of `spam' or `spew' and `forgery'. Massive floods of
forged articles intended to disrupt a newsgroup. Typically these have
reasonable-looking headers but complete gibberish for content, making the
legitimate articles too difficult to find. This tactic has been most
notoriously used by the Church of Scientology to disrupt discussion on the
newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, but is unfortunately not by any means
confined to that group.
