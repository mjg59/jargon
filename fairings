 :fairings: n., /ferÂ´ingz/ [FreeBSD; orig. a typo for fairness] A term thrown
out in discussion whenever a completely and transparently nonsensical
argument in one's favor(?) seems called for, e,g. at the end of a really long
thread for which the outcome is no longer even cared about since everyone is
now so sick of it; or in rebuttal to another nonsensical argument ("Change
the loader to look for /kernel.pl? What about fairings?")
