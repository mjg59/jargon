 :overclock: /oh´vr·klok´/, vt. To operate a CPU or other digital logic
device at a rate higher than it was designed for, under the assumption that
the manufacturer put some {slop} into the specification to account for
manufacturing tolerances. Overclocking something can result in intermittent
{crash}es, and can even burn things out, since power dissipation is directly
proportional to {clock} frequency. People who make a hobby of this are
sometimes called "overclockers"; they are thrilled that they can run their
CPU a few percent faster, even though they can only tell the difference by
running a {benchmark} program. see also {case mod}.
