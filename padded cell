 :padded cell: /n./ Where you put {luser}s so they can't hurt anything. A
program that limits a luser to a carefully restricted subset of the
capabilities of the host system (for example, the `rsh(1)' utility on USG
Unix). Note that this is different from an {iron box} because it is overt and
not aimed at enforcing security so much as protecting others (and the luser)
from the consequences of the luser's boundless naivete (see {naive}). Also
`padded cell environment'.
