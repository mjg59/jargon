 :heisenbug: /hi:'zen-buhg/ n. [from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in
quantum physics] A bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one
attempts to probe or isolate it. (This usage is not even particularly
fanciful; the use of a debugger sometimes alters a program's operating
environment significantly enough that buggy code, such as that which relies
on the values of uninitialized memory, behaves quite differently.) Antonym of
{Bohr bug}; see also {mandelbug}, {schroedinbug}. In C, nine out of ten
heisenbugs result from uninitialized auto variables, {fandango on core}
phenomena (esp. lossage related to corruption of the malloc {arena}) or
errors that {smash the stack}.
