 :heisenbug: /hi:'zen-buhg/ [from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in
quantum physics] n. A bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one
attempts to probe or isolate it. Antonym of {Bohr bug}; see also {mandelbug},
{schroedinbug}. In C, nine out of ten heisenbugs result from either {fandango
on core} phenomena (esp. lossage related to corruption of the malloc {arena})
or errors that {smash the stack}.
