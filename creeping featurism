 :creeping featurism: /kree'ping fee'chr-izm/ n. 1. Describes a systematic
tendency to load more {chrome} and {feature}s onto systems at the expense of
whatever elegance they may have possessed when originally designed. see also
{feeping creaturism}. "You know, the main problem with {BSD} UNIX has always
been creeping featurism." 2. More generally, the tendency for anything
complicated to become even more complicated because people keep saying "Gee,
it would be even better if it had this feature too". (see {feature}.) The
result is usually a patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time,
rather than being planned. Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add
just one extra little feature to help someone ... and then another ... and
another.... When creeping featurism gets out of hand, it's like a cancer.
Usually this term is used to describe computer programs, but it could also be
said of the federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars. A similar
phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see {second-system
effect}. see also {creeping elegance}.
