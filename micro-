 :micro-: pref. 1. Very small; this is the root of its use as a quantifier
prefix. 2. A quantifier prefix, calling for multiplication by 10^-6 (see
{quantifiers}). Neither of these uses is peculiar to hackers, but hackers
tend to fling them both around rather more freely than is countenanced in
standard English. It is recorded, for example, that one CS professor used to
characterize the standard length of his lectures as a microcentury -- that
is, about 52.6 minutes (see also {attoparsec}, {nanoacre}, and especially
{microfortnight}). 3. Personal or human-scale -- that is, capable of being
maintained or comprehended or manipulated by one human being. This sense is
generalized from microcomputer, and is esp. used in contrast with macro- (the
corresponding Greek prefix meaning `large'). 4. Local as opposed to global
(or {macro-}). Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to reduce
pollution only solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of getting to work
might be better solved by using mass transit, moving to within walking
distance, or (best of all) telecommuting.
