 :patch space: /n./ An unused block of bits left in a binary so that it can
later be modified by insertion of machine-language instructions there
(typically, the patch space is modified to contain new code, and the
superseded code is patched to contain a jump or call to the patch space). The
widening use of HLLs has made this term rare; it is now primarily historical
outside IBM shops. see {patch} (sense 4), {zap} (sense 4), {hook}.
