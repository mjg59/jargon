 :geekasm: Originally from a quote on the PBS show "Scientific American
Frontrers" (week of May 21st 2002) by MIT professor Alex Slocum: "When they
build a machine, if they do the calculations right, the machine works and you
get this intense ... uhh ... just like a geekasm, from knowing that what you
created in your mind and on the computer is actually doing what you told it
to do". Unsurprisingly, this usage went live on the Web almost instantly.
Every hacker knows this feeling. Compare earlier {progasm}.
