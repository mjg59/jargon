 :randomness: /n./ 1. An inexplicable misfeature; gratuitous inelegance. 2. A
{hack} or {crock} that depends on a complex combination of coincidences (or,
possibly, the combination upon which the crock depends for its accidental
failure to malfunction). "This hack can output characters 40--57 by putting
the character in the four-bit accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting
six bits -- the low 2 bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing." "What
randomness!" 3. Of people, synonymous with `flakiness'. The connotation is
that the person so described is behaving weirdly, incompetently, or
inappropriately for reasons which are (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring
into, (b) are probably as inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c)
are likely to pass with time. "Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's
just randomness. see if he calls back."
