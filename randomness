 RANDOMNESS n. An unexplainable misfeature; gratuitous inelegance. Also, a
HACK or CROCK which depends on a complex combination of coincidences (or
rather, the combination upon which the crock depends for its accidental
failure to malfunction). "This hack can output characters 40-57 by putting
the character in the accumulator field of an XCT and then extracting 6 bits
--- the low two bits of the XCT opcode are the right thing." "What
randomness!"
