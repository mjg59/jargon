 :scram switch: n. [from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off
switch (see {Big Red Switch}), esp. one positioned to be easily hit by
evacuating personnel. In general, this is _not_ something you {frob} lightly;
these often initiate expensive events (such as Halon dumps) and are installed
in a {dinosaur pen} for use in case of electrical fire or in case some
luckless {field servoid} should put 120 volts across himself while {Easter
egging}. (see also {molly-guard}, {TMRC}.) "Scram" was in origin a backronym
for "Safety Cut Rope Axe Man" coined by Enrico Fermi himself. The story goes
that in the earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the
possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their
mathematical models. Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms in
place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor. One
mechanism took the form of `scram technicians'. These individuals stood next
to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the control rods. Equipped
with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood ready for the (literal)
`scram' command. If necessary, they would cut the cables, and gravity would
expeditiously return the control rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet
another kind of {core dump}. Modern reactor control rods are held in place
with claw-like devices, held closed by current. SCRAM switches are circuit
breakers that immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the
rapid insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.
