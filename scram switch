 :scram switch: n. [from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off
switch (see {Big Red Switch}), esp. one positioned to be easily hit by
evacuating personnel. In general, this is *not* something you {frob} lightly;
these often initiate expensive events (such as Halon dumps) and are installed
in a {dinosaur pen} for use in case of electrical fire or in case some
luckless {field servoid} should put 120 volts across himself while {Easter
egging}. (see also {molly-guard}, {TMRC}.)
