 :priority interrupt: [from the hardware term] n. Describes any stimulus
compelling enough to yank one right out of {hack mode}. Classically used to
describe being dragged away by an {SO} for immediate sex, but may also refer
to more mundane interruptions such as a fire alarm going off in the near
vicinity. Also called an {NMI} (non-maskable interrupt), especially in
PC-land.
