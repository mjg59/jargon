 :gorets: /gorÂ´ets/, n. The unknown ur-noun, fill in your own meaning. Found
esp. on the Usenet newsgroup alt.gorets, which seems to be a running contest
to redefine the word by implication in the funniest and most peculiar way,
with the understanding that no definition is ever final. [A correspondent
from the former Soviet Union informs me that gorets is Russian for `mountain
dweller'. Another from France informs me that goret is archaic French for a
young pig --ESR] Compare {frink}.
