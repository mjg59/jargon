 :gorets: /gor'ets/ n. The unknown ur-noun, fill in your own meaning. Found
esp. on the USENET newsgroup alt.gorets, which seems to be a running contest
to redefine the word by implication in the funniest and most peculiar way,
with the understanding that no definition is ever final. [A correspondent
from the Former Soviet Union informs me that `gorets' is Russian for
`mountain dweller' -- ESR] Compare {frink}.
