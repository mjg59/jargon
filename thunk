 THUNK n. [from the implementation model for ALGOL-60's "call by name", a
design accident that resulted from a THINKO when attempting to describe "call
by reference"] 1. An expression, frozen together with its environment for
later evaluation if and when needed. The process of unfreezing a THUNK is
called `forcing'. 2. Stub routine, in an overlay programming environment,
which loads and jumps to the correct overlay. 3. People and and activities
scheduled in a thunklike manner. "It occurred to me the other day that I am
rather accurately modelled by a thunk --- I frequently need to be forced to
completion." --- paraphrased from a .plan file.
