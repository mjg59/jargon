 HUMOR, HACKER n. A distinctive style of shared intellectual humor found
among hackers, having the following marked characteristics: 1) Fascination
with form-vs.-content jokes, paradoxes, and humor having to do with confusion
of metalevels (see META). One way to make a hacker laugh: hold an index card
in front of him/her with "THIS IS GREEN" written on it in bold red ink, or
vice-versa (note, however, that this is only funny the first time). 2)
Elaborate deadpan parodies of large intellectual constructs such as standards
documents, language descriptions (see INTERCAL) and even entire scientific
theories (see QUANTUM BOGODYNAMICS, COMPUTRON). 3) Jokes which involve
screwily precise reasoning from bizarre, ludicrous or just grossly
counter-intuitive premises. 4) Fascination with puns and wordplay. 5) A
fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive currents of
intelligence in it, for example: old Warner Brothers and Rocky & Bullwinkle
cartoons, Charlie Chaplin movies, the B-52s, and Monty Python's Flying
Circus. Humor which combines this trait with elements of high camp and
slapstick is especially favored. 6) References to the symbol-object
antinomies and associated ideas in Zen Buddhism and (less often) Taoism. see
HAS THE X NATURE, DISCORDIANISM, ZEN, HA HA ONLY SERIOUS. see also FILK,
COMPUTER; RETROCOMPUTING; and Appendix C. If you have an itchy feeling that
all six of these traits are really aspects of one thing that is incredibly
difficult to talk about exactly, you are a) correct and b) responding like a
hacker. These traits are also recognizable (though in a less marked form)
throughout SCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM.
