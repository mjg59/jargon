 :installfest: [Linux community since c.1998] Common portmanteau word for
"installation festival"; Linux user groups frequently run these. Computer
users are invited to bring their machines to have Linux installed on their
machines. The idea is to get them painlessly over the biggest hump in
migrating to Linux, which is initially installing and configuring it for the
user's machine.
