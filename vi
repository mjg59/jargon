 :vi: /VÂ·I/, not, /vi:/, never, /siks/, n. [from `Visual Interface'] A screen
editor crufted together by Bill Joy for an early {BSD} release; an interview
describing how it came to be is available. Became the de facto standard Unix
editor and a nearly undisputed hacker favorite outside of MIT until the rise
of {EMACS} after about 1984. Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will
neither take commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, and the
default setup on older versions provides no indication of which mode the
editor is in (years ago, a correspondent reported that he has often heard the
editor's name pronounced /vi:l/; there is now a vi clone named vile).
Nevertheless vi (and variants such as vim and elvis) is still widely used
(about half the respondents in a 1991 Usenet poll preferred it), and even
EMACS fans often resort to it as a mail editor and for small editing jobs
(mainly because it starts up faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS). see
