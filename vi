 VI /vee ie/, *not* /vie/ and NEVER /siks/ [from `Visual Editor'] n. A screen
editor CRUFTED TOGETHER by Bill Joy for an early BSD version. Became the
de-facto standard UNIX editor until displaced by EMACS after about 1984.
Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will neither take commands while
accepting input text nor vice versa, and it is easy to forget which mode one
is in (see CHOKE, GAG, BARF). Nevertheless it is still widely used for small
editing jobs (mainly because it starts up faster than bulky EMACS) and many
hackers take some trouble to maintain their vi reflexes.
