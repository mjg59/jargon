 :interrupts locked out: adj. When someone is ignoring you. In a restaurant,
after several fruitless attempts to get the waitress's attention, a hacker
might well observe "She must have interrupts locked out". The synonym
`interrupts disabled' is also common. Variations abound; "to have one's
interrupt mask bit set" and "interrupts masked out" is also heard. see also
