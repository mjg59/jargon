 INTERRUPTS LOCKED OUT (in't@-ruptz lokt owt) When someone is ignoring you.
In a restaurant, after several fruitless attempts to get the waitress's
attention, a hacker might well observe that "She must have interrupts locked
out." Variations of this abound; "to have one's interrupt mask bit set" is
also heard.
