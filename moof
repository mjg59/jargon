 :Moof: /moof/ [MAC users] 1. n. The call of semi-legendary creature, also
called the `dogcow', that lurks in the depths of the Macintosh Technical
Notes Hypercard stack V3.1. (previous version of this entry claimed,
incorrectly, that Moof was the name of the *creature*) The full story of the
dogcow is told in technical note #31 (the particular Moof illustrated is
properly named `Clarus'). Option-shift-click will cause it to emit a
characteristic `Moof!' or `!fooM' sound. *Getting* to tech note 31 is the
hard part; to discover how to do that, one must needs examine the stack
script with a hackerly eye. Clue: {rot13} is involved. A dogcow also appears
if you choose `Page Setup...' with a LaserWriter selected and click on the
`Options' button. 2. adj. Used to flag software that's a hack, something
untested and on the edge. On one Apple CD-ROM, certain folders such as "Tools
& Apps (Moof!)" and "Development Platforms (Moof!)", are so marked to
indicate that they contain software not fully tested or sanctioned by the
powers that be. When you open these folders you cross the boundary into
hackerland.
