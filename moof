 :Moof: /moof/ [MAC users] 1. n. The call of a semi-legendary creature,
properly called the {dogcow}. (Some previous version of this entry claimed,
incorrectly, that Moof was the name of the *creature*.) 2. adj. Used to flag
software that's a hack, something untested and on the edge. On one Apple
CD-ROM, certain folders such as "Tools & Apps (Moof!)" and "Development
Platforms (Moof!)", are so marked to indicate that they contain software not
fully tested or sanctioned by the powers that be. When you open these folders
you cross the boundary into hackerland.
