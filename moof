 :Moof: /moof/ [Macintosh users] 1. /n./ The call of a semi-legendary
creature, properly called the {dogcow}. (Some previous versions of this entry
claimed, incorrectly, that Moof was the name of the *creature*.) 2. /adj./
Used to flag software that's a hack, something untested and on the edge. On
one Apple CD-ROM, certain folders such as "Tools & Apps (Moof!)" and
"Development Platforms (Moof!)", are so marked to indicate that they contain
software not fully tested or sanctioned by the powers that be. When you open
these folders you cross the boundary into hackerland. 3. /v./ On the
Microsoft Network, the term `moof' has gained popularity as a verb meaning
`to be suddenly disconnected by the system'. One might say "I got moofed".
