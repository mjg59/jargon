 :BOF: /B-O-F/ or /bof/ n. Abbreviation for the phrase "Birds Of a Feather"
(flocking together), an informal discussion group and/or bull session
scheduled on a conference program. It is not clear where or when this term
originated, but it is now associated with the USENIX conferences for UNIX
techies and was already established there by 1984. It was used earlier than
that at DECUS conferences, and is reported to have been common at SHARE
meetings as far back as the early 1960s.
