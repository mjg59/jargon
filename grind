 GRIND (griend) v. 1. [MIT and Berkeley] To format code, especially LISP
code, by indenting lines so that it looks pretty. Hence, PRETTY PRINT, the
generic term for such operations. 2. [UNIX] To generate the formatted version
of a document from the nroff, troff, TEX or Scribe source. 3. To run
seemingly interminably, performing some tedious and inherently useless task.
