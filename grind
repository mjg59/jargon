 :grind: vt. 1. [MIT and Berkeley] To prettify hardcopy of code, especially
LISP code, by reindenting lines, printing keywords and comments in distinct
fonts (if available), etc. This usage was associated with the MacLISP
community and is now rare; {prettyprint} was and is the generic term for such
operations. 2. [UNIX] To generate the formatted version of a document from
the {{nroff}}, {{troff}}, {{TeX}}, or Scribe source. 3. To run seemingly
interminably, esp. (but not necessarily) if performing some tedious and
inherently useless task. Similar to {crunch} or {grovel}. Grinding has a
connotation of using a lot of CPU time, but it is possible to grind a disk,
network, etc. see also {hog}. 4. To make the whole system slow. "Troff really
grinds a PDP-11." 5. `grind grind' excl. Roughly, "Isn't the machine slow
today!"
