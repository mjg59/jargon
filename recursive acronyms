 RECURSIVE ACRONYMS pl.n. A hackish (and especially MIT) tradition is to
choose acronyms which refer humorously to themselves or to other acronyms.
The classic examples were two MIT editors called EINE ("EINE Is Not EMACS")
and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially"). More recently, GNU (q.v., sense #1) is
said to stand for "GNU's Not UNIX!"
