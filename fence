 :fence: n. 1. A sequence of one or more distinguished ({out-of-band})
characters (or other data items), used to delimit a piece of data intended to
be treated as a unit (the computer-science literature calls this a
`sentinel'). The NUL (ASCII 0000000) character that terminates strings in C
is a fence. Hex FF is also (though slightly less frequently) used this way.
see {zigamorph}. 2. [among users of optimizing compilers] Any technique,
usually exploiting knowledge about the compiler, that blocks certain
optimizations. Used when explicit mechanisms are not available or are
overkill. Typically a hack: "I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush
of the optimizer's register-coloring info" can be expressed by the shorter
"That's a fence procedure".
