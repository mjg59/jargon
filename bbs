 :BBS: /B-B-S/ n. [abbreviation, `Bulletin Board System'] An electronic
bulletin board system; that is, a message database where people can log in
and leave broadcast messages for others grouped (typically) into {topic
group}s. Thousands of local BBS systems are in operation throughout the U.S.,
typically run by amateurs for fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a
single modem line each. Fans of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial
timesharing bboards such as CompuServe and GEnie tend to consider local BBSes
the low-rent district of the hacker culture, but they serve a valuable
function by knitting together lots of hackers and users in the personal-micro
world who would otherwise be unable to exchange code at all. see also
{bboard}.
