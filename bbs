 :BBS: /B-B-S/ n. [common; abbreviation, `Bulletin Board System'] An
electronic bulletin board system; that is, a message database where people
can log in and leave broadcast messages for others grouped (typically) into
{topic group}s. The term was especially applied to the thousands of local BBS
systems that operated during the pre-Internet microcomputer era of roughly
1980 to 1995, typically run by amateurs for fun out of their homes on MS-DOS
boxes with a single modem line each. Fans of Usenet and Internet or the big
commercial timesharing bboards such as CompuServe and GEnie tended to
consider local BBSes the low-rent district of the hacker culture, but they
served a valuable function by knitting together lots of hackers and users in
the personal-micro world who would otherwise have been unable to exchange
code at all. Post-Internet, BBSs are likely to be local newsgroups on an ISP;
efficiency has increased but a certain flavor has been lost. see also
