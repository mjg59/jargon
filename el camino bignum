 EL CAMINO BIGNUM /el' k@-mee'noh big'num/ n. El Camino Real. El Camino Real
is the name of a street through the San Francisco peninsula that originally
extended (and still appears in places) all the way down to Mexico City.
Navigation on the San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El
Camino Real, which is assumed to run north and south even though it doesn't
really in many places (see LOGICAL). El Camino Real runs right past Stanford
University, and so is familiar to hackers. The Spanish word "real" (which has
two syllables (ree-ahl')) means "royal"; El Camino Real is "the royal road".
Now the English word "real" is used in mathematics to describe numbers (and
by analogy is misused in computer jargon to mean floating-point numbers). In
the FORTRAN language, for example, a "real" quantity is a number typically
precise to seven decimal places, and a "double precision" quantity is a
larger floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen decimal places.
When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976 or so, he remarked what a
long road El Camino Real was. Making a pun on "real", he started calling it
"El Camino Double Precision" --- but when the hacker was told that the road
was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it "El Camino Bignum", and that name
has stuck. (see BIGNUM.)
