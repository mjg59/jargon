 :flush: v. 1. [common] To delete something, usually superfluous, or to abort
an operation. "All that nonsense has been flushed." 2. [Unix/C] To force
buffered I/O to disk, as with an fflush(3) call. This is not an abort or
deletion as in sense 1, but a demand for early completion! 3. To leave at the
end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal). "I'm going to flush
now." "Time to flush." 4. To exclude someone from an activity, or to ignore a
person. `Flush' was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but was not,
as having been flushed. It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid
image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output
buffer, washing the characters away before they could be printed. The Unix/C
usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the fflush(3) call in C's
standard I/O library (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS
programmers at {DEC} and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965).
Unix/C hackers found the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa.
