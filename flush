 FLUSH (fluhsh) v. 1. To delete something, usually superfluous. "All that
nonsense has been flushed." Standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
operation. 2. To leave at the end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for
a meal). "I'm going to flush now." "Time to flush." 3. To exclude someone
from an activity. 4. [UNIX/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with an
fflush(3) call. UNIX hackers find the ITS usage confusing and vice versa.
