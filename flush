 FLUSH v. 1. To delete something, usually superfluous. "All that nonsense has
been flushed." Standard ITS terminology for aborting an output operation (but
note sense 4 below!); one speaks of the text that would have been printed,
but was not, as having been flushed. Under ITS, if you asked to have a file
printed on your terminal, it was printed a page at a time; at the end of each
page, it asked whether you want to see more, and if you said no, it replied
"FLUSHED". (It is speculated that this term arose from a vivid image of
flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the internal output buffer,
washing the characters away before they can be printed.) 2. To leave at the
end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal). "I'm going to flush
now." "Time to flush." 3. To exclude someone from an activity. 4. [UNIX/C] To
force buffered I/O to disk, as with an fflush(3) call. This is *not* an abort
as in sense 1 but a demand for early completion! UNIX hackers find the ITS
usage confusing and vice versa.
