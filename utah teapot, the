 :Utah teapot, the: This object is historically one of the first complex 3D
models to be rendered in computer graphics. It consisted of about 110
vertices, and was generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier
curves, based on a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model
served as a basis for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for
lighting, textures, bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the model is
trivial to render and thus is often not suited to demonstrate the complexity
of modern research. Despite this, the tea pot still appears, now and then, in
recent papers. More on the teapot's history lives at The History Of The
Teapot. Compare {lenna}, {Stanford Bunny}
