 :jiffy: n. 1. The duration of one tick of the system clock on your computer
(see {tick}). Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second in the U.S. and Canada,
1/50 most other places), but more recently 1/100 sec has become common. "The
swapper runs every 6 jiffies" means that the virtual memory management
routine is executed once for every 6 ticks of the clock, or about ten times a
second. 2. Confusingly, the term is sometimes also used for a 1-millisecond
{wall time} interval. 3. Even more confusingly, physicists semi-jokingly use
`jiffy' to mean the time required for light to travel one foot in a vacuum,
which turns out to be close to one _nanosecond_. 4. Indeterminate time from a
few seconds to forever. "I'll do it in a jiffy" means certainly not now and
possibly never. This is a bit contrary to the more widespread use of the
word. Oppose {nano}. see also {Real Soon Now}.
