 JIFFY n. 1. The width of one tick of the system clock on the computer (see
TICK). Often 1 AC cycle time (1/60 second in the U.S. and 1/50 elsewhere) but
more recently 1/100 sec has become common. 2. Confusingly, the term is
sometimes also used for a 1-millisecond WALL TIME interval. "The swapper runs
every six jiffies" means that the virtual memory management routine is
executed once for every six ticks of the clock, or about ten times a second.
3. Indeterminate time from a few seconds to forever. "I'll do it in a jiffy"
means certainly not now and possibly never. This is a bit contrary to the
more widespread use of the word.
