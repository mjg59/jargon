 :tunafish: n. In hackish lore, refers to the mutated punchline of an age-old
joke to be found at the bottom of the manual pages of `tunefs(8)' in the
original {BSD} 4.2 distribution. The joke was removed in later releases once
commercial sites started using 4.2. Tunefs relates to the `tuning' of
file-system parameters for optimum performance, and at the bottom of a few
pages of wizardly inscriptions was a `BUGS' section consisting of the line
"You can tune a file system, but you can't tunafish". Variants of this can be
seen in other BSD versions, though it has been excised from some versions by
humorless management {droid}s. The [nt]roff source for SunOS 4.1.1 contains a
comment apparently designed to prevent this: "Take this out and a Unix Demon
will dog your steps from now until the `time_t"s wrap around." [It has since
been pointed out that indeed you can tunafish. Usually at a canning
factory... --ESR]
