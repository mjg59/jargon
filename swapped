 SWAPPED adj. From the older (per-task) method of using secondary storage
devices to implement support for multitasking. Something which is SWAPPED IN
is available for immediate use in main memory, and otherwise is SWAPPED OUT.
Often used metaphorically to refer to people's memories ("I read the Scheme
Report every few months to keep the information swapped in.") or to their own
availability ("I'll swap you in as soon as I finish looking at this other
problem."). Compare PAGE IN, PAGE OUT.
