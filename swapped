 SWAPPED adj. From the use of secondary storage devices to implement virtual
memory in computer systems. Something which is SWAPPED IN is available for
immediate use in main memory, and otherwise is SWAPPED OUT. Often used
metaphorically to refer to people's memories ("I read TECO ORDER every few
months to keep the information swapped in.") or to their own availability
("I'll swap you in as soon as I finish looking at this other prob- lem.").
