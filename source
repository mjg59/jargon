 :source: n. [very common] In reference to software, source is invariably
shorthand for `source code', the preferred human-readable and
human-modifiable form of the program. This is as opposed to object code, the
derived binary executable form of a program. This shorthand readily takes
derivative forms; one may speak of "the sources of a system" or of "having
source".
