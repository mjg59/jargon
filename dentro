 :dentro: /denÂ´troh/ [{demoscene}] Combination of {demo} (sense 4) and
{intro}. Other name mixings include intmo, dentmo etc. and are used usually
when the authors are not quite sure whether the program is a {demo} or an
{intro}. Special-purpose coinages like wedtro (some member of a group got
married), invtro (invitation intro) etc. have also been sighted.
