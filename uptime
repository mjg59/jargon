 :uptime: n. Technically, a machine's time since last reboot; jargonically,
how long a hacker has gone without sleep. "What's your uptime?" "Oh, about 28
hours so far, but I think I can probably do another 12." This is, of course,
a reference to the uptime command and the pride with which most Unix types
note how long their computers go without reboots. Uptime is a testament to
the stability of the OS and the stamina of the hacker.
