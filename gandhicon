 :GandhiCon: There is a quote from Mohandas Gandhi, describing the stages of
establishment resistence to a winning strategy of nonviolent activism, that
partisans of {open source} and especially {Linux} have embraced as almost an
explanatory framework for the behaviors they observe while trying to get
corporations and other large institutions to take new ways of doing things
seriously: First they ignore you. Then they laugh at you. Then they fight
you. Then you win. In hacker usage this quote has miscegenated with the U.S
military's DefCon terminology describing `defense conditions' or degrees of
war alert. At GandhiCon One, you're being ignored. At GandhiCon Two,
opponents are laughing at you and dismissing the idea that you could ever be
a threat. At GandhiCon Three, they're fighting you on the merits and/or
attempting to discredit you. At GandhiCon Four, you're winning and they are
arguing to save face or stave off complete collapse of their position.
