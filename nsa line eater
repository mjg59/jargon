 :NSA line eater: n. The National Security Agency trawling program sometimes
assumed to be reading the net for the U.S. Government's spooks. Most hackers
used to think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just
in case. Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA
actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program. The
standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like `KGB', `Uzi', `nuclear
materials', `Palestine', `cocaine', and `assassination' in their {sig block}s
in a (probably futile) attempt to confuse and overload the creature. The
{GNU} version of {EMACS} actually has a command that randomly inserts a bunch
of insidious anarcho-verbiage into your edited text. As far back as the 1970s
there was a mainstream variant of this myth involving a `Trunk Line Monitor',
which supposedly used speech recognition to extract words from telephone
trunks. This is much harder than noticing keywords in email, and most of the
people who originally propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or
the storage, signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a
project. On the basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper
to hire 50 high-school students and just let them listen in. Twenty years and
several orders of technological magnitude later, however, there are clear
indications that the NSA has actually deployed such filtering (again, very
much against U.S. law). In 2000, the FBI wants to get into this act with its
`Carnivore' surveillance system.
