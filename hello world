 HELLO WORLD! interj. 1. The canonical minimal test message in the C/UNIX
universe. In folklore, the first program a C coder is supposed to write in a
new environment is one that just prints "Hello, world!" to standard output.
Environments that generate an unreasonably large executable for this trivial
test or which require a HAIRY compiler-linker invocation to generate it are
considered to LOSE. 2. Greeting uttered by a hacker making an entrance or
requesting information from anyone present. "Hello, world! Is the VAX back up
yet?"
