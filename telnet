 TELNET: /tel'net/ vt. To communicate with another ARPANET host using the
{TELNET} program. TOPS-10 people use the word IMPCOM since that is the
program name for them. Sometimes abbreviated to TN. "I usually TN over to
SAIL just to read the AP News." ten-finger interface: n. The interface
between two networks which cannot be directly connected for security reasons;
refers to the practice of placing two terminals side by side and having an
operator read from one and type into the other. tense: adj. Of programs, very
clever and efficient. A tense piece of code often got that way because it was
highly {bum}med, but sometimes it was just based on a great idea. A comment
in a clever display routine by Mike Kazar, a student hacker at CMU: "This
routine is so tense it will bring tears to your eyes. Much thanks to Craig
Everhart and James Gosling for inspiring this {hack attack}." A tense
programmer is one who produces tense code. tenured graduate student: n. One
who has been in graduate school for ten years (the usual maximum is five or
six): a `ten-yeared' student (get it?). Students don't really get tenure, of
course, the way professors do, but a tenth-year graduate student has probably
been around the university longer than any non-tenured professor. tera-:
/te'r@/ pref. Multiplier, 10 ^ 12 or 2 ^ 40. see {kilo-}. teraflop club:
/ter'a-flop kluhb/ [FLOP = Floating Point Operation] n. Mythical group of
people who consume outrageous amounts of computer time in order to produce a
few simple pictures of glass balls with intricate ray tracing techniques. Cal
Tech professor James Kajiya is said to have been the founding member. see
also {kilo-}. terminak: /ter'mi-nak`/ [Caltech, ca. 1979] n. Any
malfunctioning computer terminal. A common failure mode of Lear-Siegler ADM3a
terminals caused the `L' key to produce the `K' code instead; complaints
about this tended to look like "Terminak #3 has a bad keyboard. Pkease fix."
see {sun-stools}, {Telerat}, {HP-SUX}. terminal brain death: n. Extreme form
of {terminal illness} (sense #1). terminal illness: n. 1. Syn. {raster burn}.
2. The `burn-in' condition your CRT tends to get if you don't have a screen
saver. terminal junkie: [Great Britain] n. A {wannabee} or early {larval
stage} hacker who spends most of his/her time wandering the directory tree
and writing {noddy} programs just to get his/her fix of computer time.
Variants include `terminal jockey', `console junkie', or {console jockey}.
The term `console jockey' seems to imply more expertise than the other three.
see also {twink}, {read-only user}. terpri: /ter'pree/ [from the LISP 1.5
(and later, MACLISP)] vi. To output a {CRLF}. Now rare as slang, though still
used as jargon in Common Lisp. It is a contraction of `TERminate PRInt line'.
test: v. 1. To allow real users to bash on a prototype for long enough to get
thoroughly acquainted with it, with careful monitoring and followup of the
results. 2. Some bored random trying a couple of the simpler features with a
developer looking over his/her shoulder ready to pounce on mistakes. Judging
by the quality of most software, the second definition is far more prevalent.
see also {demo}. TeX: /tekh/ n. An extremely powerful {macro}-based
text-formatter written by Donald E. Knuth, very popular in the
computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced UNIX
`troff(1)', the other favored formatter, even at many UNIX installations).
TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation and spelling (all
caps, with the E depressed below the baseline) of the name (the mixed-case
`TeX{}' is considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices). They like
to proliferate names from the word `TeX' --- such as TeXnician (TeX user),
TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX programmer), TeXhax,
TeXnique, TeXpert. text: n. 1. Executable code, esp. a `pure code' portion
shared between multiple instances of a program running in a multitasking OS
(compare {English}). 2. Textual material in the mainstream sense; data which
are in ordinary ASCII or EBCDIC representation. "Those are text files, you
can review them using the editor". These two contradictory senses confuse
hackers, too. thanks in advance: [USENET] Conventional net.politeness ending
a posted request for information or assistance. Sometimes written
`advTHANKSance' or `aTdHvAaNnKcSe' or abbreviated `TIA'. see {net.-},
{netiquette}. theology: n. 1. Ironically used to refer to {religious issues}.
2. Technical fine points of an abstruse nature, esp. those where the
resolution is of theoretical interest but relatively {marginal} with respect
to actual use of a design or system. Used esp. around software issues with a
heavy AI or language design component. Example: the deep- vs. shallow-binding
debate in the design of dynamically scoped LISPs. theory: n. Used in the
general sense of idea, plan, story, or set of rules. This is a generalization
and abuse of the technical meaning. "What's the theory on fixing this TECO
loss?" "What's the theory on dinner tonight?" ("Chinatown, I guess.") "What's
the current theory on letting lusers on during the day?" "The theory behind
this change is to fix the following well-known screw...." thinko: /thing'koh/
[by analogy with `typo'] n. A bubble in the stream of consciousness; a
momentary, correctable glitch in mental processing, especially one involving
recall of information learned by rote. Syn. {braino}. Compare {mouso}. This
time, for sure!: Ritual affirmation frequently uttered during protracted
debugging sessions involving numerous small obstacles (as, in for example,
attempts to bring up a UUCP connection). For the proper effect, this must be
uttered in a fruity imitation of Bullwinkle the Moose. Also heard: "Hey,
Rocky! Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!". The canonical response is, of
course, "But that trick *never* works!". see {{Humor, Hacker}}. thrash: vi.
To move wildly or violently, without accomplishing anything useful. Paging or
swapping systems which are overloaded waste most of their time moving data
into and out of core (rather than performing useful computation), and are
therefore said to thrash. Someone who keeps changing his mind (esp. about
what to work on next) is said to be thrashing. A person frantically trying to
execute too many tasks at once (and not spending enough time on any of them)
may also be described as thrashing. Compare {multitask}. thread: /thred/ n.
[USENET, GEnie] Common abbreviation of `topic thread', a more or less
continuous chain of postings on a single topic. three-finger salute: n. Syn.
{vulcan nerve pinch}. thunk: /thuhnk/ [mythically, the sound made by data
when pushed onto the stack] n. 1. " ... a piece of coding which provides an
address." --- P.Z. Ingerman, who invented {thunk}s in 1961 as a way of
binding actual parameters to their formal definitions in Algol-60 procedure
calls. If a procedure is called with an expression in the place of a formal
parameter, the compiler generates a {thunk} to compute the expression and
leave the address of the result in some standard location such as an index
register. 2. Later generalized into an expression, frozen together with its
environment for later evaluation if and when needed. The process of
unfreezing these {thunk}s is called `forcing'. 3. A {stubroutine}, in an
overlay programming environment, which loads and jumps to the correct
overlay. 4. People and activities scheduled in a thunklike manner. "It
occurred to me the other day that I am rather accurately modelled by a thunk
--- I frequently need to be forced to completion." --- paraphrased from a
.plan file. tick: n. 1. A {jiffy} (sense #1). 2. In simulations, the discrete
unit of time that passes `between' iterations of the simulation mechanism. In
AI applications, this amount of time is often left unspecified, since the
only constraint of interest is that caused things happen after their causes.
This sort of AI simulation is often pejoratively referred to as
`tick-tick-tick' simulation, especially when the issue of simultaneity of
events with long, independent chains of causes is {handwave}d. tick-list
features: [Acorn Computers] n. Features in software or hardware that
customers insist on but never use (calculators in desktop TSRs and that sort
of thing). tickle a bug: vt. To cause a normally hidden bug to manifest
through some known series of inputs or operations. "You can tickle the bug in
the Paradise's highlight handling by trying to set bright yellow reverse
video". time sink: [poss. by analogy with `heat sink'] n. A project which
consumes unbounded amounts of time. time T: /tiem tee/ n. 1. An unspecified
but usually well-understood time, often used in conjunction with a later time
T+1. "We'll meet on campus at time T or at Louie's at time T+1." means, in
the context of going out for dinner, "If we meet at Louie's directly, we can
meet there a little later than if we meet on campus and then have to travel
to Louie's." (Louie's is a Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto that is a favorite
with hackers. Had the number 30 been used instead of `one', it would have
implied that the travel time from campus to Louie's is thirty minutes;
whatever time T is (and that hasn't been decided on yet), you can meet half
an hour later at Louie's than you could on campus and end up eating at the
same time. see also {since time T equals minus infinity}. tinycrud:
/tie'nee-kruhd/ n. Pejorative used by habitues of older game-oriented {MUD}
versions for TinyMuds and other user-extensible {MUD} variants; esp. common
among users of the rather violent and competitive AberMUD and MIST systems.
These people justify the slur on the basis of how (allegedly) inconsistent
and lacking in genuine feel or atmosphere the scenarios generated in user
extensible muds can be. Other common knocks on them are that they feature
little overall plot, bad game topology, little competitive interaction, etc.
--- not to mention the alleged horrors of the TinyMud code itself. This
dispute is on of the MUD world's hardiest perennial {holy wars}. tip of the
ice-cube: [IBM] n. The visible part of something small and insignificant.
Used as an ironic comment in situations where `tip of the iceberg' might be
appropriate if the subject were actually nontrivial. tired iron: [IBM] n.
Hardware that is perfectly functional but enough behind the state of the art
to have been superseded by new products, presumably with enough improvement
in bang-per-buck that the old stuff is starting to look a bit like a
{dinosaur}. tits on a keyboard: n. Small bumps on certain keycaps to keep
touch-typists registered (usually on the `5' of a numeric keypad, and on `F'
and `J' of a QWERTY keyboard).
