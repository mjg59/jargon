 WATERBOTTLE SOCCER n. A deadly sport practiced mainly by Sussman's graduate
students. It, along with chair bowl- ing, is the most evident manifestation
of the "locker room atmosphere" said to reign in that sphere. (Sussman
doesn't approve.) [As of 11/82, it's reported that the sport has given way to
a new game called "disc-boot," and Sussman even participates occasionally.] -
