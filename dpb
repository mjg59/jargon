 :DPB: /d*-pib'/ [from the PDP-10 instruction set] vt. To plop something down
in the middle. Usage: silly. "DPB yourself into that couch there." The
connotation would be that the couch is full except for one slot just big
enough for you to sit in. DPB means `DePosit Byte', and was the name of a
PDP-10 instruction that inserts some bits into the middle of some other bits.
This usage has been kept alive by the Common LISP function of the same name.
