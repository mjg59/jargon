 DPB /duh-pib'/ [from the PDP-10 instruction set] v., obs. To plop something
down in the middle. Usage: silly. Example: "Dpb yourself into that couch,
there." The connotation would be that the couch is full except for one slot
just big enough for you to sit in. DPB means "DePosit Byte", and was the name
of a PDP-10 instruction that inserts some bits into the middle of some other
bits.
