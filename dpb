 :DPB: /d*-pib'/ [from the PDP-10 instruction set] vt. To plop something down
in the middle. Usage: silly. "DPB yourself into that couch there." The
connotation would be that the couch is full except for one slot just big
enough for one last person to sit in. DPB means `DePosit Byte', and was the
name of a PDP-10 instruction that inserts some bits into the middle of some
other bits. Hackish usage has been kept alive by the Common LISP function of
the same name.
