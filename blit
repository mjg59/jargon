 BLIT /blit/ vt. 1. To copy a large array of bits from one part of a
computer's memory to another part, particularly when the memory is being used
to determine what is shown on a display screen. "The storage allocator picks
through the table and copies the good parts up into high memory, and at the
end BLITs it all back down again." see BITBLT, BLT, DD, CAT, BLAST, SNARF,
Appendix B. More generally, to perform some operation (such as toggling) on a
large array of bits while moving them. 2. An early experimental bit-mapped
terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as the AT&T
