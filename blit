 :blit: /blit/ vt. 1. [common] To copy a large array of bits from one part of
a computer's memory to another part, particularly when the memory is being
used to determine what is shown on a display screen. "The storage allocator
picks through the table and copies the good parts up into high memory, and
then blits it all back down again." see {bitblt}, {BLT}, {dd}, {cat},
{blast}, {snarf}. More generally, to perform some operation (such as
toggling) on a large array of bits while moving them. 2. [historical, rare]
Sometimes all-capitalized as `BLIT': an early experimental bit-mapped
terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as the AT&T
5620. (The folk etymology from `Bell Labs Intelligent Terminal' is incorrect.
Its creators liked to claim that "Blit" stood for the Bacon, Lettuce, and
Interactive Tomato.)
