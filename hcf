 HCF (aych-see-eff) n. Mnemonic for "Halt and Catch Fire", any of several
undocumented and semi-mythical machine instructions with destructive
side-effects, supposedly included for test purposes on several well-known
architectures going as far back as the IBM 360. The MC68000 microprocessor
was the first for which the HCF opcode became widely known. The 68000 HCF
causes the processor to toggle a subset of the bus lines as rapidly as it
can; in some configurations this can actually cause lines to burn up.
