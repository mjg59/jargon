 :HCF: /H-C-F/ n. Mnemonic for `Halt and Catch Fire', any of several
undocumented and semi-mythical machine instructions with destructive
side-effects, supposedly included for test purposes on several well-known
architectures going as far back as the IBM 360. The MC6800 microprocessor was
the first for which an HCF opcode became widely known. This instruction
caused the processor to {toggle} a subset of the bus lines as rapidly as it
could; in some configurations this could actually cause lines to burn up.
Compare {killer poke}.
