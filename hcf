 HCF /aych-see-eff/ n. Mnemonic for "Halt and Catch Fire", any of several
undocumented and semi-mythical machine instructions with destructive
side-effects, supposedly included for test purposes on several well-known
architectures going as far back as the IBM 360. The MC6800 microprocessor was
the first for which the HCF opcode became widely known. This instruction
caused the processor to toggle a subset of the bus lines as rapidly as it
can; in some configurations this can actually cause lines to burn up.
