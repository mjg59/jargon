 :posting: n. Noun corresp. to v. {post} (but note that {post} can be
nouned). Distinguished from a `letter' or ordinary {email} message by the
fact that it is broadcast rather than point-to-point. It is not clear whether
messages sent to a small mailing list are postings or email; perhaps the best
dividing line is that if you don't know the names of all the potential
recipients, it is a posting.
