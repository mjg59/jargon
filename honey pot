 :honey pot: n. 1. A box designed to attract {cracker}s so that they can be
observed in action. It is usually well isolated from the rest of the network,
but has extensive logging (usually network layer, on a different machine).
Different from an {iron box} in that its purpose is to attract, not merely
observe. Sometimes, it is also a defensive network security tactic - you set
up an easy-to-crack box so that your real servers don't get messed with. The
concept was presented in Cheswick & Bellovin's book "Firewalls and Internet
Security". 2. A mail server that acts as an open relay when a single message
is attempted to send through it, but discards or diverts for examination
messages that are detected to be part of a spam run.
