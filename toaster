 :toaster: n. 1. The archetypal really stupid application for an embedded
microprocessor controller; often used in comments that imply that a scheme is
inappropriate technology (but see {elevator controller}). "{DWIM} for an
assembler? That'd be as silly as running UNIX on your toaster!" 2. A very,
very dumb computer. "You could run this program on any dumb toaster." see
{bitty box}, {Get a real computer!}, {toy}, {beige toaster}. 3. A Macintosh,
esp. the Classic Mac. Some hold that this is implied by sense 2. 4. A
peripheral device. "I bought my box without toasters, but since then I've
added two boards and a second disk drive."
