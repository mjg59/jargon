 :Godzillagram: /god-zil'*-gram/ n. [from Japan's national hero] 1. A network
packet that in theory is a broadcast to every machine in the universe. The
typical case of this is an IP datagram whose destination IP address is
[255.255.255.255]. Fortunately, few gateways are foolish enough to attempt to
implement this! 2. A network packet of maximum size. An IP Godzillagram has
65,536 octets.
