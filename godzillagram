 :Godzillagram: /god·zil'@·gram/, n. [from Japan's national hero] 1. A
network packet that in theory is a broadcast to every machine in the
universe. The typical case is an IP datagram whose destination IP address is
[255.255.255.255]. Fortunately, few gateways are foolish enough to attempt to
implement this case! 2. A network packet of maximum size. An IP Godzillagram
has 65,535 octets. Compare {super source quench}, {Christmas tree packet},
{martian}.
