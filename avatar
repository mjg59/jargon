 :avatar: [CMU, Tektronix] n. Syn. {root}, {superuser}. There are quite a few
UNIX machines on which the name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather
than `root'. This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who disliked the term
`superuser', and was propagated through an ex-CMU hacker at Tektronix.
