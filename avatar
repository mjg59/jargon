 :avatar: n. [in Hindu mythology, the incarnation of a god] 1. Among people
working on virtual reality and {cyberspace} interfaces, an avatar is an icon
or representation of a user in a shared virtual reality. The term is
sometimes used on {MUD}s. 2. [CMU, Tektronix] {root}, {superuser}. There are
quite a few Unix machines on which the name of the superuser account is
`avatar' rather than `root'. This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who
found the terms root and superuser unimaginative, and thought `avatar' might
better impress people with the responsibility they were accepting.
