 DEADLOCK (ded'lok) n. A situation wherein two or more processes are unable
to proceed because each is waiting for another to do something. A common
example is a program communicating to a PTY or STY, which may find itself
waiting for output from the PTY/STY before sending anything more to it, while
the PTY/STY is similarly waiting for more input from the controlling program
before outputting anything. (This particular flavor of deadlock is called
"starvation". Another common flavor is "constipation", where each process is
trying to send stuff to the other, but all buffers are full because nobody is
reading anything.) see DEADLY EMBRACE, RACE CONDITION.
