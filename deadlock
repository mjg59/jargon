 :deadlock: n. 1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more processes are
unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do
something. A common example is a program communicating to a server, which may
find itself waiting for output from the server before sending anything more
to it, while the server is similarly waiting for more input from the
controlling program before outputting anything. (It is reported that this
particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a `starvation deadlock',
though the term `starvation' is more properly used for situations where a
program can never run simply because it never gets high enough priority.
Another common flavor is `constipation', in which each process is trying to
send stuff to the other but all buffers are full because nobody is reading
anything.) see {deadly embrace}. 2. Also used of deadlock-like interactions
between humans, as when two people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries
to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying
from side to side without making any progress because they always move the
same way at the same time.
