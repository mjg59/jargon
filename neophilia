 NEOPHILIA /nee-oh-fil'-ee-uh/ n. The trait of being excited and pleased by
novelty. Common trait of most hackers, SF fans, and members of several other
connected "leading-edge" subcultures including the pro-technology
"Whole-Earth" wing of the ecology movement, space activists, theater people,
the membership of MENSA, and the Discordian/neo-pagan underground. All these
groups overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share
characteristic hacker tropisms for SF, MUSIC and ORIENTAL FOOD.
