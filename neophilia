 :neophilia: /nee`oh-fil'-ee-*/ n. The trait of being excited and pleased by
novelty. Common among most hackers, SF fans, and members of several other
connected leading-edge subcultures, including the pro-technology `Whole
Earth' wing of the ecology movement, space activists, many members of Mensa,
and the Discordian/neo-pagan underground (see {geek}). All these groups
overlap heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share
characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction, {{music}}, and {{oriental
food}}. The opposite tendency is `neophobia'.
