 :raw mode: n. A mode that allows a program to transfer bits directly to or
from an I/O device (or, under {bogus} systems that make a distinction, a disk
file) without any processing, abstraction, or interpretation by the operating
system. Compare {rare mode}, {cooked mode}. This is techspeak under UNIX,
jargon elsewhere.
