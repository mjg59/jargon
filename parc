 1984, 1996; ISBN 0-262-01153-0), an excellent computer science text used in
introductory courses at MIT. So called because of the wizard on the jacket.
One of the {bible}s of the LISP/Scheme world. Also, less commonly, known as
the {Purple Book}. :wizard hat: n. [also, after Terry Pratchett, `pointy
hat'] Notional headgear worn by whoever is the {wizard} in a particular
context. The implication is that it's a transferable role. "Talk to Alice,
she's wearing the TCP/IP wizard hat while Bob is on vacation." This metaphor
is sufficiently live that one may actually see hackers miming the act of
putting on, taking off, or transferring a phantom hat. Compare {patch
pumpkin}. :wizard mode: n. [from {rogue}] A special access mode of a program
or system, usually passworded, that permits some users godlike privileges.
Generally not used for operating systems themselves (`root mode' or `wheel
mode' would be used instead). This term is often used with respect to games
that have editable state. :wizardly: adj. Pertaining to wizards. A wizardly
{feature} is one that only a wizard could understand or use properly.
:wok-on-the-wall: n. A small microwave dish antenna used for cross-campus
private network circuits, from the obvious resemblance between a microwave
dish and the Chinese culinary utensil. :womb box: n. 1. [TMRC] Storage space
for equipment. 2. [proposed] A variety of hard-shell equipment case with
heavy interior padding and/or shaped carrier cutouts in a foam-rubber matrix;
mundanely called a `flight case'. Used for delicate test equipment,
electronics, and musical instruments. :WOMBAT: /wom'bat/ adj. [acronym: Waste
Of Money, Brains, And Time] Applied to problems which are both profoundly
{uninteresting} in themselves and unlikely to benefit anyone interesting even
if solved. Often used in fanciful constructions such as `wrestling with a
wombat'. see also {crawling horror}, {SMOP}. Also note the rather different
usage as a metasyntactic variable in {{Commonwealth Hackish}}. Users of the
PDP-11 database program DATATRIEVE adopted the wombat as their notional
mascot; the program's help file responded to "HELP WOMBAT" with factual
information about Real World wombats. :womble: n. [Unisys UK: from British
cartoon characters] A user who has great difficulty in communicating their
requirements and/or in using the resulting software. Extreme case of {luser}.
An especially senior or high-ranking womble is referred to as Great-Uncle
Bulgaria. :wonky: /wong'kee/ adj. [from Australian slang] Yet another
approximate synonym for {broken}. Specifically connotes a malfunction that
produces behavior seen as crazy, humorous, or amusingly perverse. "That was
the day the printer's font logic went wonky and everybody's listings came out
in Tengwar." Also in `wonked out'. see {funky}, {demented}, {bozotic}.
:woofer: n. [University of Waterloo] Some varieties of wide paper for
printers have a perforation 8.5 inches from the left margin that allows the
excess on the right-hand side to be torn off when the print format is 80
columns or less wide. The right-hand excess may be called `woofer'. This term
(like {tweeter}) has been in use at Waterloo since 1972, but is elsewhere
unknown. In audio jargon, the word refers to the bass speaker(s) on a hi-fi.
:workaround: n. 1. A temporary {kluge} used to bypass, mask, or otherwise
avoid a {bug} or {misfeature} in some system. Theoretically, workarounds are
always replaced by {fix}es; in practice, customers often find themselves
living with workarounds for long periods of time. "The code died on NUL
characters in the input, so I fixed it to interpret them as spaces." "That's
not a fix, that's a workaround!" 2. A procedure to be employed by the user in
order to do what some currently non-working feature should do. Hypothetical
example: "Using META-F7 {crash}es the 4.43 build of Weemax, but as a
workaround you can type CTRL-R, then SHIFT-F5, and delete the remaining
{cruft} by hand." :working as designed: adj. [IBM] 1. In conformance to a
wrong or inappropriate specification; useful, but misdesigned. 2. Frequently
used as a sardonic comment on a program's utility. 3. Unfortunately also used
as a bogus reason for not accepting a criticism or suggestion. At {IBM}, this
sense is used in official documents! see {BAD}. :worm: n. [from `tapeworm' in
John Brunner's novel "The Shockwave Rider", via XEROX PARC] A program that
propagates itself over a network, reproducing itself as it goes. Compare
{virus}. Nowadays the term has negative connotations, as it is assumed that
only {cracker}s write worms. Perhaps the best-known example was Robert T.
Morris's {Great Worm} of 1988, a `benign' one that got out of control and
hogged hundreds of Suns and VAXen across the U.S. see also {cracker}, {RTM},
{Trojan horse}, {ice}. :wormhole: /werm'hohl/ n. [from the `wormhole'
singularities hypothesized in some versions of General Relativity theory] 1.
[n.,obs.] A location in a monitor which contains the address of a routine,
with the specific intent of making it easy to substitute a different routine.
This term is now obsolescent; modern operating systems use clusters of
wormholes extensively (for modularization of I/O handling in particular, as
in the Unix device-driver organization) but the preferred techspeak for these
clusters is `device tables', `jump tables' or `capability tables'. 2.
[Amateur Packet Radio] A network path using a commercial satellite link to
join two or more amateur VHF networks. So called because traffic routed
through a wormhole leaves and re-enters the amateur network over great
distances with usually little clue in the message routing header as to how it
got from one relay to the other. Compare {gopher hole} (sense 2). :wound
around the axle: adj. In an infinite loop. Often used by older computer
types. :wrap around: vi. (also n. `wraparound' and v. shorthand `wrap') 1.
[techspeak] The action of a counter that starts over at zero or at `minus
infinity' (see {infinity}) after its maximum value has been reached, and
continues incrementing, either because it is programmed to do so or because
of an overflow (as when a car's odometer starts over at 0). 2. To change
{phase} gradually and continuously by maintaining a steady wake-sleep cycle
somewhat longer than 24 hours, e.g., living six long (28-hour) days in a week
(or, equivalently, sleeping at the rate of 10 microhertz). This sense is also
called {phase-wrapping}. :write-only code: n. [a play on `read-only memory']
Code so arcane, complex, or ill-structured that it cannot be modified or even
comprehended by anyone but its author, and possibly not even by him/her. A
{Bad Thing}. :write-only language: n. A language with syntax (or semantics)
sufficiently dense and bizarre that any routine of significant size is
automatically {write-only code}. A sobriquet applied occasionally to C and
often to APL, though {INTERCAL} and {TECO} certainly deserve it more. see
also {Befunge}. :write-only memory: n. The obvious antonym to `read-only
memory'. Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless chain of
approvals required of component specifications, during which no actual
checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics once created a
specification for a write-only memory and included it with a bunch of other
specifications to be approved. This inclusion came to the attention of
Signetics {management} only when regular customers started calling and asking
for pricing information. Signetics published a corrected edition of the data
book and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones. Later, around 1974,
Signetics bought a double-page spread in "Electronics" magazine's April issue
and used the spec as an April Fools' Day joke. Instead of the more
conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N,
Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included diagrams of "bit
capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining vs. number of
socket insertions", and "AQL vs. selling price". The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC
VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and VDD of 0V, +/- 2%. :Wrong Thing: n. A design,
action, or decision that is clearly incorrect or inappropriate. Often
capitalized; always emphasized in speech as if capitalized. The opposite of
the {Right Thing}; more generally, anything that is not the Right Thing. In
cases where `the good is the enemy of the best', the merely good -- although
good -- is nevertheless the Wrong Thing. "In C, the default is for
module-level declarations to be visible everywhere, rather than just within
the module. This is clearly the Wrong Thing." :wugga wugga: /wuh'g* wuh'g*/
n. Imaginary sound that a computer program makes as it labors with a tedious
or difficult task.{grind} (sense 4). :wumpus: /wuhm'p*s/ n. The central
monster (and, in many versions, the name) of a famous family of very early
computer games called "Hunt The Wumpus'. The original was invented in 1970
(several years before {ADVENT}) by Gregory Yob. The wumpus lived somewhere in
a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later
versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron and Mo"bius
strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave with five `crooked
arrows'; these could be shot through up to three connected rooms, and would
kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the wounded wumpus, which
got very angry). Unfortunately for players, the movement necessary to map the
maze was made hazardous not merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you
stepped on him) but also by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that
would pick you up and drop you at a random location (later versions added
`anaerobic termites' that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that
randomly changed pit locations). This game appears to have been the first to
use a non-random graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like
the even older Star Trek games). In this respect, as in the dungeon-like
setting and its terse, amusing messages, it prefigured {ADVENT} and {Zork}
and was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork acknowledged this heritage by
including a super-bat colony). A C emulation of the original Basic game is
available at the Retrocomputing Museum, `http://www.ccil.org/retro'.
:WYSIAYG: /wiz'ee-ayg/ adj. Describes a user interface under which "What You
see Is _All_ You Get"; an unhappy variant of {WYSIWYG}. Visual,
`point-and-shoot'-style interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves,
but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be
better served by a command-style interface. When this happens, the frustrated
user has a WYSIAYG problem. This term is most often used of editors, word
processors, and document formatting programs. WYSIWYG `desktop publishing'
programs, for example, are a clear win for creating small documents with lots
of fonts and graphics in them, especially things like newsletters and
presentation slides. When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other
hand, scale changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG
limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a command-driven
formatter like {{TeX}} or Unix's {{troff}} becomes not just desirable but a
necessity. Compare {YAFIYGI}. :WYSIWYG: /wiz'ee-wig/ adj. [Traced to Flip
Wilson's "Geraldine" character c.1970] Describes a user interface under which
"What You see Is What You Get", as opposed to one that uses more-or-less
obscure commands that do not result in immediate visual feedback. True
WYSIWYG in environments supporting multiple fonts or graphics is a a
rarely-attained ideal; there are variants of this term to express real-world
manifestations including WYSIAWYG (What You see Is _Almost_ What You Get) and
WYSIMOLWYG (What You see Is More or Less What You Get). All these can be
mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to dumbed-down
{user-friendly} interfaces targeted at non-programmers; a hacker has no fear
of obscure commands (compare {WYSIAYG}). On the other hand, {EMACS} was one
of the very first WYSIWYG editors, replacing (actually, at first overlaying)
the extremely obscure, command-based {TECO}. see also {WIMP environment}.
[Oddly enough, WYSIWYG has already made it into the OED, in lower case yet.
--ESR] = X = ===== :X: /X/ n. 1. Used in various speech and writing contexts
(also in lowercase) in roughly its algebraic sense of `unknown within a set
defined by context' (compare {N}). Thus, the abbreviation 680x0 stands for
68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, or 68040, and 80x86 stands for 80186, 80286,
80386, 80486, 80586 or 80686 (note that a Unix hacker might write these as
680[0-6]0 and 80[1-6]86 or 680?0 and 80?86 respectively; see {glob}). 2.
[after the name of an earlier window system called `W'] An over-sized,
over-featured, over-engineered and incredibly over-complicated window system
developed at MIT and widely used on Unix systems. :XEROX PARC: /zee'roks
park'/ n. The famed Palo Alto Research Center. For more than a decade, from
the early 1970s into the mid-1980s, PARC yielded an astonishing volume of
groundbreaking hardware and software innovations. The modern mice, windows,
and icons style of software interface was invented there. So was the laser
printer and the local-area network; and PARC's series of D machines
anticipated the powerful personal computers of the 1980s by a decade. Sadly,
the prophets at PARC were without honor in their own company, so much so that
it became a standard joke to describe PARC as a place that specialized in
developing brilliant ideas for everyone else. The stunning shortsightedness
and obtusity of XEROX's top-level {suit}s has been well anatomized in
"Fumbling The Future: How XEROX Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal
Computer" by Douglas K. Smith and Robert C. Alexander (William Morrow & Co.,
