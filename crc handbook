 :CRC handbook: Any of the editions of the Chemical Rubber Company Handbook
of Chemistry and Physics; there are other CRC handbooks, such as the CRC
Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, but "the" CRC handbook is the
chemistry and physics reference. It is massive tome full of mathematical
tables, physical constants of thousands of alloys and chemical compounds,
dielectric strengths, vapor pressure, resistivity, and the like. Hackers have
remarkably little actual use for these sorts of arcana, but are such
information junkies that a large percentage of them acquire copies anyway and
would feel vaguely bereft if they couldn't look up the magnetic
susceptibility of potassium permanganate at a moment's notice. On hackers'
bookshelves, the CRC handbook is rather likely to keep company with an
unabridged Oxford English Dictionary and a good atlas.
