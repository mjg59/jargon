 :owned: 1. [cracker slang; often written "0wned"] Your condition when your
machine has been cracked by a root exploit, and the attacker can do anything
with it. This sense is occasionally used by hackers. 2. [gamers, IRC,
crackers] To be dominated, controlled, mastered. For example, if you make a
statement completely and utterly false, and someone else corrects it in a way
that humiliates or removes you, you are said to "have been owned" by that
person. When referring to games, "I own0r UT GOTYE" means that one has
mastered Unreal Tournament, Game of the Year Edition to such a level that
even the hardest AI characters are mere lunchmeat, and that no ordinary
mortal player would even receive a point in competition. There are several
spelling variants: 0wned, 0wn0r3d, even pwn0r3d. Hackers do not use this
sense. P
