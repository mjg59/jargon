 :spam: [from the {MUD} community] vt. 1. To crash a program by overrunning a
fixed-size buffer with excessively large input data. see also {buffer
overflow}, {overrun screw}, {smash the stack}. 2. To cause a newsgroup to be
flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can spam a newsgroup
with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g. asking "What do
you think of abortion?" on soc.women). This is often done with
{cross-post}ing (e.g. any message which is crossposted to alt.rush-limbaugh
and alt.politics.homosexuality will almost inevitably spam both groups).
