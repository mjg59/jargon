 :spam: /vt.,vi.,n./ [from "Monty Python's Flying Circus"] 1. To crash a
program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer with excessively large input data.
see also {buffer overflow}, {overrun screw}, {smash the stack}. 2. To cause a
newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can
spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g.
asking "What do you think of abortion?" on soc.women). This is often done
with {cross-post}ing (e.g. any message which is crossposted to
alt.rush-limbaugh and alt.politics.homosexuality will almost inevitably spam
both groups). 3. To send many identical or nearly-identical messages
separately to a large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is one sure way to
infuriate nearly everyone on the Net. The second and third definitions have
become much more prevalent as the Internet has opened up to non-techies, and
to many Usenetters sense 3 is now (1995) primary. In this sense the term has
apparantly begun to go mainstream, though without its original sense or
folkloric freight -- there is apparently a widespread belief among {luser}s
that "spamming" is what happens when you dump cans of Spam into a revolving
fan.
