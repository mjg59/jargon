 INTERNET ADDRESS n. An `absolute' network address of the form foo@bar.baz,
where foo is a user name, bar is a SITENAME (q.v.), and baz is a `domain'
name, possibly including periods itself. Contrasts with BANG PATH, q.v.; see
also NETWORK, THE and NETWORK ADDRESS. All Internet machines and most UUCP
sites can now resolve these addresses, thanks to a large amount of
behind-the-scenes magic and PD software written since 1980 or so. see also
