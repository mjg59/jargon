 :Internet address:: n. 1. [techspeak] An absolute network address of the
form foo@bar.baz, where foo is a user name, bar is a {sitename}, and baz is a
`domain' name, possibly including periods itself. Contrast with {bang path};
see also {network, the} and {network address}. All Internet machines and most
UUCP sites can now resolve these addresses, thanks to a large amount of
behind-the-scenes magic and PD software written since 1980 or so. see also
{bang path}, {domainist}. 2. More loosely, any network address reachable
through Internet; this includes {bang path} addresses and some internal
corporate and government networks. Reading Internet addresses is something of
an art. Here are the four most important top-level functional Internet
domains followed by a selection of geographical domains: com commercial
organizations edu educational institutions gov U.S. government civilian sites
mil U.S. military sites Note that most of the sites in the com and edu
domains are in the U.S. or Canada. us sites in the U.S. outside the
functional domains su sites in the ex-Soviet Union (see {kremvax}). uk sites
in the United Kingdom Within the us domain, there are subdomains for the
fifty states, each generally with a name identical to the state's postal
abbreviation. Within the uk domain, there is an ac subdomain for academic
sites and a co domain for commercial ones. Other top-level domains may be
divided up in similar ways.
