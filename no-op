 :no-op: /noh'op/ n,v. alt. NOP /nop/ [no operation] 1. A machine instruction
that does nothing (sometimes used in assembler-level programming as filler
for data or patch areas, or to overwrite code to be removed in binaries). see
also {JFCL}. 2. A person who contributes nothing to a project, or has nothing
going on upstairs, or both. As in "He's a no-op." 3. Any operation or
sequence of operations with no effect, such as circling the block without
finding a parking space, or putting money into a vending machine and having
it fall immediately into the coin-return box, or asking someone for help and
being told to go away. "Oh, well, that was a no-op." Hot-and-sour soup (see
{great-wall}) that is insufficiently either is `no-op soup'; so is wonton
soup if everybody else is having hot-and-sour.
