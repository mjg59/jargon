 :leak: n. With qualifier, one of a class of resource-management bugs that
occur when resources are not freed properly after operations on them are
finished, so they effectively disappear (leak out). This leads to eventual
exhaustion as new allocation requests come in. {memory leak} and {fd leak}
have their own entries; one might also refer, to, say, a `window handle leak'
in a window system.
