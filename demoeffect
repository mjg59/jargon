 :demoeffect: n. [{demoscene}] What among hackers is called a {display hack}.
Classical effects include "plasma" (colorful mess), "keftales" (x*x+y*y and
other similar patterns, usually combined with color-cycling), realtime
fractals, realtime 3d graphics, etc. Historically, demo effects have cheated
as much as possible to gain more speed and more complexity, using
low-precision math and masses of assembler code and building animation
realtime are three common tricks, but use of special hardware to fake effects
is a {Good Thing} on the demoscene (though this is becoming less common as
platforms like the Amiga fade away).
