 :case mod: [from `case modification'] 1. Originally a kind of hardware hack
on a PC intended to support {overclocking} (e.g. with cutouts for oversized
fans, or a freon-based or water-cooling system). 2. Nowadays, similar drastic
surgery that's done just to make a machine look nifty. The commonest case
mods combine acrylic case windows with LEDs to give the machine an eerie
interior glow like a B-movie flying saucer. More advanced forms of case
modding involve building machines into weird and unlikely shapes. The effect
can be quite artistic, but one of the unwritten rules is that the machine
must continue to function as a computer.
