 :email: /ee'mayl/ (also written `e-mail') 1. n. Electronic mail
automatically passed through computer networks and/or via modems over
common-carrier lines. Contrast {snail-mail}, {paper-net}, {voice-net}. see
{network address}. 2. vt. To send electronic mail. Oddly enough, the word
`emailed' is actually listed in the OED; it means "embossed (with a raised
pattern) or perh. arranged in a net or open work". A use from 1480 is given.
The word is derived from Old French `emmaill"ure', network. A French
correspondent tells us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel
obtained by heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e)
is a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects like jewels
and cook them in a furnace).
