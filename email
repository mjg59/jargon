 :email: /ee'mayl/ (also written `e-mail' and `E-mail') 1. n. Electronic mail
automatically passed through computer networks and/or via modems over
common-carrier lines. Contrast {snail-mail}, {paper-net}, {voice-net}. see
{network address}. 2. vt. To send electronic mail. Oddly enough, the word
`emailed' is actually listed in the OED; it means "embossed (with a raised
pattern) or perh. arranged in a net or open work". A use from 1480 is given.
The word is probably derived from French `e'maille" (enameled) and related to
Old French `emmailleu"re' (network). A French correspondent tells us that in
modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by heating special paints in
a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is a craftsman who makes email (he
generally paints some objects (like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a
furnace). There are numerous spelling variants of this word. In Internet
traffic up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a not-too-distant
second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant third and fourth.
