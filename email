computer networks and/or via modems over common-carrier lines. Contrast
{snail-mail}, {paper-net}, {voice-net}. see {network address}. 2. vt. To send
electronic mail. Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the

use from 1480 is given. The word is derived from French `emmailleure',
network.
