 HIRSUTE Occasionally used humorously as a synonym for HAIRY. - 19 - HOOK n.
An extraneous piece of software or hardware included in order to simplify
later additions or debug options. For instance, a program might execute a
location that is normally a JFCL, but by changing the JFCL to a PUSHJ one can
insert a debugging routine at that point.
