collection of poorly matching parts, forming a distressing whole.") 2. n. A

expedient, if not clear, manner. Often used to repair bugs. Often involves
AD-HOCKERY and verges on being a CROCK. 3. Something that works for the wrong

get around that weird bug, but there's probably a better way." Also KLUGE UP.
