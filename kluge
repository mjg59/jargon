 :kluge: /klooj/ [from the German `klug', clever; poss related to Polish
`klucza', a trick or hook] 1. n. A Rube Goldberg (or Heath Robinson) device,
whether in hardware or software. 2. n. A clever programming trick intended to
solve a particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner. Often
used to repair bugs. Often involves {ad-hockery} and verges on being a
{crock}. 3. n. Something that works for the wrong reason. 4. vt. To insert a
kluge into a program. "I've kluged this routine to get around that weird bug,
but there's probably a better way." 5. [WPI] n. A feature that is implemented
in a {rude} manner. Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant
spelling `kludge'. Reports from {old fart}s are consistent that `kluge' was
the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s
and, at that time, used exclusively of *hardware* kluges. In 1947, the "New
York Folklore Quarterly" reported a classic shaggy-dog story `Murgatroyd the
Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a `kluge' was a
complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function. Other sources report
that `kluge' was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of
electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea.
However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade older.
Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device called a
"Kluge paper feeder", an adjunct to mechanical printing presses. Legend has
it that the Kluge feeder was designed before small, cheap electric motors and
control electronics; it relied on a fiendishly complex assortment of cams,
belts, and linkages to both power and synchronize all its operations from one
motive driveshaft. It was accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent
breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair -- but oh, so clever! People
who tell this story also aver that `Kluge' was virtualthe name of a design
engineer. There is in fact a Brandtjen & Kluge Inc., an old family business
that manufactures printing equipment -- interestingly, their name is
pronounced /kloo'gee/! Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR,
1994) that his company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named
Kluge /kloo'gee/, who built and co-designed the original Kluge automatic
feeder in 1919. Mr. Brandtjen claims, however, that this was a *simple*
device (with only four cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its
complexity took hold. {TMRC} and the MIT hacker culture of the early '60s
seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII
military slang (see also {foobar}). It seems likely that `kluge' came to MIT
via alumni of the many military electronics projects that had been located in
Cambridge (many in MIT's venerable Building 20, in which {TMRC} is also
located) during the war. The variant `kludge' was apparently popularized by
the {Datamation} article mentioned above; it was titled "How to Design a
Kludge" (February 1962, pp. 30, 31). This spelling was probably imported from
Great Britain, where {kludge} has an independent history (though this fact
was largely unknown to hackers on either side of the Atlantic before a
mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group alt.folklore.computers over the First and
Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think {kludge} was
just a mutation of {kluge}). It now appears that the British, having
forgotten the etymology of their own `kludge' when `kluge' crossed the
Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the `kludge' orthography in the other
direction and confusing their American cousins' spelling! The result of this
history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/
but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as `kludge'.
British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally and use it in a restricted
negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly
learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it
/kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess
appropriate in view of the word's meaning.
