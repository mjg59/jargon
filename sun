 :Sun: n. Sun Microsystems. Hackers remember that the name was originally an
acronym, Stanford University Network. Sun started out around 1980 with some
hardware hackers (mainly) from Stanford talking to some software hackers
(mainly) from UC Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept married a clever
board design based on the Motorola 68000 to {BSD} Unix. Sun went on to lead
the workstation industry through the 1980s, and for years afterwards remained
an engineering-driven company and a good place for hackers to work. Though
Sun drifted away from its techie origins after 1990 and has since made some
strategic moves that disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by
maintaining proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still
considered within the family in much the same way {DEC} was in the 1970s and
early 1980s.
