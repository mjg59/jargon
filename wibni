 WIBNI: // [Bell Labs: Wouldn't It Be Nice If] n. What most requirements
documents and specifications consist entirely of. Compare {IWBNI}. widget: n.
1. A meta-thing. Used to stand for a real object in didactic examples
(especially database tutorials). Legend has it that the original widgets were
holders for buggy whips. "But suppose the parts list for a widget has 52
entries...." 2. [poss. evoking `window gadget'] A user interface object in
{X} graphical user interfaces. wiggles: n. [scientific computation] In
solving partial differential equations by finite difference and similar
methods, wiggles are sawtooth (up-down-up-down) oscillations at the shortest
wavelength representable on the grid. If an algorithm is unstable, this is
often the most unstable waveform, so it grows to dominate the solution.
Alternatively, stable (though inaccurate) wiggles can be generated near a
discontinuity by a Gibbs phenomenon.
