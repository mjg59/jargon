 :rathole: [from the English idiom "down a rathole" for a waste of money or
time] A technical subject that is known to be able to absorb infinite amounts
of discussion time without more than an infinitesimal probability of arrival
at a conclusion or consensus. "That's a rathole" (or just "Rathole!") is
considered a pre-emptive bid to change the subject. The difference between
ratholes and {religious issues} is that a holy war cannot be pre-empted in
this way. Canonical examples are XML namespaces and open-source licensing.
