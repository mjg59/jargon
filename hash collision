 HASH COLLISION [from the technical usage] n. When used of people, signifies
a confusion in associative memory or imagination, especially a persistent one
(see THINKO). True story: one of us (ESR) was once on the phone with a friend
about to move out to Berkeley. When asked what he expected Berkeley to be
like, the friend replied "Well, I have this mental picture of naked women
throwing Molotov cocktails, but I think that's just a collision in my hash
tables." The variant "hash clash" is also reported.
