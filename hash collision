 :hash collision: n. [from the techspeak] (var. `hash clash') When used of
people, signifies a confusion in associative memory or imagination,
especially a persistent one (see {thinko}). True story: One of us [ESR] was
once on the phone with a friend about to move out to Berkeley. When asked
what he expected Berkeley to be like, the friend replied: "Well, I have this
mental picture of naked women throwing Molotov cocktails, but I think that's
just a collision in my hash tables." Compare {hash bucket}.
