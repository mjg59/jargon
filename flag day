 FLAG DAY n. A software change which is neither forward nor backward
compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to revert. "Can we install
that without causing a flag day for all users?" This term has nothing to do
with the use of the word FLAG to mean a variable that has two values. It came
into use when a massive change was made to the MULTICS timesharing system to
convert from the old ASCII code to the new one; this was scheduled for Flag
Day, June 14, 1966.
