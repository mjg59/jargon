 :flag day: /n./ A software change that is neither forward- nor
backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to reverse. "Can
we install that without causing a flag day for all users?" This term has
nothing to do with the use of the word {flag} to mean a variable that has two
values. It came into use when a massive change was made to the {{Multics}}
timesharing system to convert from the old ASCII code to the new one; this
was scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966. see also
{backward combatability}.
