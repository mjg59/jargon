 :flag day: n. A software change that is neither forward- nor
backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to reverse. "Can
we install that without causing a flag day for all users?" This term has
nothing to do with the use of the word {flag} to mean a variable that has two
values. It came into use when a change was made to the definition of the
ASCII character set during the development of {Multics}. The change was
scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966. The change altered
the Multics definition of ASCII from the short-lived 1965 version of the
ASCII code to the 1967 version (in draft at the time); this moved code points
for braces, vertical bar, and circumflex. see also {backward combatability}.
The {Great Renaming} was a flag day. [Most of the changes were made to files
stored on {CTSS}, the system used to support Multics development before it
became self-hosting.] [As it happens, the first installation of a
commercially-produced computer, a Univac I, took place on Flag Day of 1951
