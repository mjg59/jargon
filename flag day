 :flag day: n. A software change that is neither forward- nor
backward-compatible, and which is costly to make and costly to reverse. "Can
we install that without causing a flag day for all users?" This term has
nothing to do with the use of the word {flag} to mean a variable that has two
values. It came into use when a massive change was made to the {{CTSS}}
timesharing system to convert from the short-lived 1965 version of the ASCII
code to the 1967 version (in draft at the time); this was scheduled for Flag
Day (a U.S. holiday), June 14, 1966. The actual change moved the code point
for the ASCII newline character; this required that all of the Multics source
code, documentation, and device drivers be changed simultaneously. see also
{backward combatability}. [Previous versions of this entry described this as
a change in {Multics}, which was wrong. Evidently this confusion arose from
the fact that the changes were made partly to facilitate Multics developmnt
