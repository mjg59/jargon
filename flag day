 FLAG DAY (flag day) [from a bit of Multics history involving a change in the
ASCII character set originally scheduled for June 14, 1966] n. A software
change which is neither forward nor backward compatible, and which is costly
to make and costly to revert. "Can we install that without causing a flag day
for all users?"
