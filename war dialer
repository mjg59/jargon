 :war dialer: n. A cracking tool, a program that calls a given list or range
of numbers and records those which answer with handshake tones (and so might
be entry points to computer or telecommunications systems). Some of these
programs have become quite sophisticated, and can now detect modem, fax or
pbx tones and log each one separately. The war dialer is one of the most
important tools in the {phreaker}'s kit. These programs evolved from early
{demon dialer}s.
