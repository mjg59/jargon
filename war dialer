 :war dialer: n. [originally from `wargames dialer', a reference to the movie
War Games] A cracking tool, a program that calls a given list or range of
phone numbers and records those which answer with handshake tones (and so
might be entry points to computer or telecommunications systems). Some of
these programs have become quite sophisticated, and can now detect modem,
fax, or PBX tones and log each one separately. The war dialer is one of the
most important tools in the {phreaker}'s kit. These programs evolved from
early {demon dialer}s.
