 :salescritter: /sayls'kri`tr/ /n./ Pejorative hackerism for a computer
salesperson. Hackers tell the following joke: Q. What's the difference
between a used-car dealer and a computer salesman? A. The used-car dealer
knows he's lying. [Some versions add: ...and probably knows how to drive.]
This reflects the widespread hacker belief that salescritters are
self-selected for stupidity (after all, if they had brains and the
inclination to use them, they'd be in programming). The terms `salesthing'
and `salesdroid' are also common. Compare {marketroid}, {suit}, {droid}.
