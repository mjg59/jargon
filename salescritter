 SALESCRITTER /sayls'kri-tr/ n. Pejorative hackerism for a computer
salesperson. Hackers tell the following joke: Q. What's the difference
between a used car dealer and a computer saleman? A. The used car dealer
knows he's lying. This reflects the widespread hacker belief that
salescritters are self-selected for stupidity (after all, if they had brains
and the inclination to use them they'd be making more money programming).
