 ASSEMBLER 1. A program translator that allows human beings to generate
machine code using mnemonics and symbolic names for memory locations rather
than raw binary; distinguished from an HLL (q.v.) by the fact that a single
assembler step generally maps to a single machine instruction (see also
LANGUAGES OF CHOICE). 2. A NANOBOT which is a physical REPLICATOR (This is
the "official" term, coined by Eric Drexler; see NANOTECHNOLOGY).
AUTOMAGICALLY (aw-toh-maj'i-klee, aw-toh-maj'i-kl-ee) adv. Automatically, but
in a way which, for some reason (typically because it is too complicated, or
too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker doesn't feel like
explaining to you. see MAGIC. Example: The C-INTERCAL compiler generates C,
then automagically invokes cc to produce an executable. = B =
