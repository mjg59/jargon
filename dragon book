 :Dragon Book: n. The classic text Compilers: Principles, Techniques and
Tools, by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman (Addison-Wesley
1986; ISBN 0-201-10088-6), so called because of the cover design featuring a
dragon labeled `complexity of compiler design' and a knight bearing the lance
`LALR parser generator' among his other trappings. This one is more
specifically known as the `Red Dragon Book' (1986); an earlier edition, sans
Sethi and titled Principles Of Compiler Design (Alfred V. Aho and Jeffrey D.
Ullman; Addison-Wesley, 1977; ISBN 0-201-00022-9), was the "reen Dragon Book'
(1977). (Also New Dragon Book, Old Dragon Book.) The horsed knight and the
Green Dragon were warily eying each other at a distance; now the knight is
typing (wearing gauntlets!) at a terminal showing a video-game representation
of the Red Dragon's head while the rest of the beast extends back in normal
space. see also {book titles}.
