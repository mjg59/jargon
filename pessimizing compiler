 PESSIMIZING COMPILER /pes'i-miez-ing kuhm-pie'lr/ [antonym of `optimizing
compiler'] n. A compiler that produces object code that is worse than the
straightforward or obvious translation. The implication is that the compiler
is actually trying to optimize the program, but through stupidity is doing
the opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have been written on purpose,
however, as pranks.
