 :pessimizing compiler: /pes'*-mi:z`ing k*m-pi:l'r/ n. A compiler that
produces object [antonym of `optimizing compiler'] code that is worse than
the straightforward or obvious hand translation. The implication is that the
compiler is actually trying to optimize the program, but through excessive
cleverness is doing the opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have been
written on purpose, however, as pranks or burlesques.
