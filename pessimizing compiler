`optimizing compiler'] A compiler that produces object code that is worse
than the straightforward or obvious hand translation. The implication is that
the compiler is actually trying to optimize the program, but through
excessive cleverness is doing the opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have
been written on purpose, however, as pranks or burlesques.
