 :pessimizing compiler: /pes'*-mi:z`ing k*m-pi:l'r/ [antonym of `optimizing
compiler'] n. A compiler that produces object code that is worse than the
straightforward or obvious hand translation. The implication is that the
compiler is actually trying to optimize the program, but through excessive
cleverness is doing the opposite. A few pessimizing compilers have been
written on purpose, however, as pranks or burlesques.
