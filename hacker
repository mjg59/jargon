 HACKER (hak'r) [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. A
person who enjoys learning the details of programming systems and how to
stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users who prefer to learn only
the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically, or who enjoys
programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person
capable of appreciating HACK VALUE (q.v.). 4. A person who is good at
programming quickly. Not everything a hacker produces is a hack. 5. An expert
at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it;
example: "A UNIX hacker". (Definitions 1 to 5 are correlated, and people who
fit them congregate.) 6. (deprecated) A malicious or inquisitive meddler who
tries to discover information by poking around. Hence "password hacker",
"network hacker". see CRACKER.
