 :spelling flame: [USENET] n. A posting ostentatiously correcting a previous
article's spelling as a way of casting scorn on the point the article was
trying to make, instead of actually responding to that point (compare
{dictionary flame}). Of course, people who are more than usually slovenly
spellers are prone to think *any* correction is a spelling flame.
