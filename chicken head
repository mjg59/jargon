 :chicken head: [Commodore] n. The Commodore Business Machines logo, which
strongly resembles a poultry part. Rendered in ASCII as `C='. With the
arguable exception of the Amiga (see {amoeba}), Commodore's machines are
notoriously crocky little {bitty box}es (see also {PETSCII}). Thus, this
usage may owe something to Philip K. Dick's novel `Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep?' (the basis for the movie `Blade Runner'), in which a
`chickenhead' is a mutant with below-average intelligence.
