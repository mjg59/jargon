 :chicken head: n. [Commodore] The Commodore Business Machines logo, which
strongly resembles a poultry part (within Commodore itself the logo was
always called `chicken lips'). Rendered in ASCII as `C='. With the arguable
exception of the Amiga (see {amoeba}), Commodore's machines were notoriously
crocky little {bitty box}es (see also {PETSCII}), albeit people have written
multitasking Unix-like operating systems with TCP/IP networking for them.
Thus, this usage may owe something to Philip K. Dick's novel "Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep?" (the basis for the movie "Blade Runner"; the novel
is now sold under that title), in which a `chickenhead' is a mutant with
below-average intelligence.
