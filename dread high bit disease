 DREAD HIGH BIT DISEASE n. A condition endemic to PRIME (formerly PR1ME)
minicomputers which results in all the characters having their high (\200)
bit ON rather than OFF. This of course makes transporting files to other
systems much more difficult, not to mention talking to true eightbit devices.
It is reported that PRIME adopted the reversed eight bit convention in order
to save 25 cents/serial line/machine. This probably qualifies as one of the
most CRETINOUS design tradeoffs ever made. see META BIT.
