 :firehose syndrome: /n./ In mainstream folklore it is observed that trying
to drink from a firehose can be a good way to rip your lips off. On computer
networks, the absence or failure of flow control mechanisms can lead to
situations in which the sending system sprays a massive flood of packets at
an unfortunate receiving system, more than it can handle. Compare {overrun},
{buffer overflow}.
