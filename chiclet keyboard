 :chiclet keyboard: /n./ A keyboard with a small, flat rectangular or
lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like pieces of chewing gum.
(Chiclets is the brand name of a variety of chewing gum that does in fact
resemble the keys of chiclet keyboards.) Used esp. to describe the original
IBM PCjr keyboard. Vendors unanimously liked these because they were cheap,
and a lot of early portable and laptop products got launched using them.
Customers rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and chiclets are not
often seen on anything larger than a digital watch any more.
