 :SIG: /sig/, n. (also common as a prefix in combining forms) A Special
Interest Group, in one of several technical areas, sponsored by the
Association for Computing Machinery; well-known ones include SIGPLAN (the
Special Interest Group on Programming Languages), SIGARCH (the Special
Interest Group for Computer Architecture) and SIGGRAPH (the Special Interest
Group for Computer Graphics). Hackers, not surprisingly, like to overextend
this naming convention to less formal associations like SIGBEER (at ACM
conferences) and SIGFOOD (at University of Illinois).
