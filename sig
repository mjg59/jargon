 :SIG: n. The Association for Computing Machinery traditionally sponsors
Special Interest Groups in various technical areas; well-known ones include
SIGARCH (the Special Interest Group for Computer Architecture) and SIGGRAPH
(the Special Interest Group for Computer Graphics). Hackers, not
surprisingly, like to overextend this naming convention to less formal
associations like SIGBEER (at ACM conferences) and SIGFOOD (at University of
Illinois).
