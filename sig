 SIG /sig/ or SIG BLOCK /sig blok/ [UNIX; often written ".sig" there] n.
Short for "signature", used specifically to refer to the electronic signature
block which most UNIX mail- and news-posting software will allow you to
automatically append to outgoing mail and news. The composition of one's sig
can be quite an art form, including an ASCII logo or one's choice of witty
sayings (see SIG QUOTE); but many consider large sigs a waste of bandwidth,
and it has been observed that the size of one's sig block is usually
inversely proportional to one's longevity and level of prestige on THE
NETWORK.
