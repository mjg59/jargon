 BRUTE FORCE adj. Describes a certain kind of primitive programming style.
Brute-force programs typically work by enumerating all possible combinations
of things in an effort to find the one combination that solves the problem.
An example of a brute-force program is one that sorts a thousand numbers by
examining them all, picking the smallest one, and saving it in another table;
then examining all the numbers again, and picking the smallest one except for
the one it already picked; and in general choosing the next number by
examining all one thousand numbers and choosing the smallest one that hasn't
yet been picked (as determined by examining all the ones already picked).
Yes, the program will produce the right answer, but it will be much slower
than a program that uses even a modicum of cleverness to avoid most of the
work. (A little bit of computer science---specifically, the theory of
algorithms---will show that if a typical large computer can sort a thousand
numbers in a tenth of a second using a clever sorting method, the brute-force
method outlined above would take about 14 hours.)
