 :firebottle: /n./ A large, primitive, power-hungry active electrical device,
similar in function to a FET but constructed out of glass, metal, and vacuum.
Characterized by high cost, low density, low reliability, high-temperature
operation, and high power dissipation. Sometimes mistakenly called a `tube'
in the U.S. or a `valve' in England; another hackish term is {glassfet}.
