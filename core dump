 :core dump: n. [common {Iron Age} jargon, preserved by UNIX] 1. [techspeak]
A copy of the contents of {core}, produced when a process is aborted by
certain kinds of internal error. 2. By extension, used for humans passing
out, vomiting, or registering extreme shock. "He dumped core. All over the
floor. What a mess." "He heard about X and dumped core." 3. Occasionally used
for a human rambling on pointlessly at great length; esp. in apology: "Sorry,
I dumped core on you". 4. A recapitulation of knowledge (compare {bits},
sense 1). Hence, spewing all one knows about a topic (syn. {brain dump}),
esp. in a lecture or answer to an exam question. "Short, concise answers are
better than core dumps" (from the instructions to an exam at Columbia). see
{core}.
