 :ADVENT: /adÂ´vent/, n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first
designed by Will Crowther on the {PDP-10} in the mid-1970s as an attempt at
computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by
Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been one of the authors of
{INTERCAL}.) Now better known as Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but
the {TOPS-10} operating system permitted only six-letter filenames in
uppercase. see also {vadding}, {Zork}, and {Infocom}. Figure 1. Screen shot
