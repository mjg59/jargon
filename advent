 ADVENT /ad'vent/ n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first
implemented on the PDP-10 by Will Crowther as an attempt at computer-refereed
fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods. Now
better known as Adventure, but the TOPS-10 operating system only permitted
6-letter filenames. This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style now
expected in text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
become fixtures of hacker-speak. "A huge green fierce snake bars the way!" "I
see no X here." (for X some noun). "You are in a maze of twisty little
passages, all alike". The "magic words" XYZZY and PLUGH also derive from this
game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
Mammoth/Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a `Colossal Cave' and a
`Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon
for a map reference to a secondary entrance.
