 :ADVENT: /ad'vent/ n. The prototypical computer adventure game, first
implemented on the {PDP-10} by Will Crowther as an attempt at
computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by
Don Woods. Now better known as Adventure, but the {{TOPS-10}} operating
system permitted only six-letter filenames. see also {vadding}. This game
defined the terse, dryly humorous style now expected in text adventure games,
and popularized several tag lines that have become fixtures of hacker-speak:
"A huge green fierce snake bars the way!" "I see no X here" (for some noun
X). "You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." "You are in a
little maze of twisty passages, all different." The `magic words' {xyzzy} and
{plugh} also derive from this game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the
exploration of the Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a
`Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns
up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance.
