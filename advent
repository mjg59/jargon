 :ADVENT: /ad'vent/ /n./ The prototypical computer adventure game, first
designed by Will Crowther on the {PDP-10} in the mid-1970s as an attempt at
computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by
Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. Now better known as Adventure, but the
{{TOPS-10}} operating system permitted only six-letter filenames. see also
{vadding}, {Zork}, and {Infocom}. This game defined the terse, dryly humorous
style since expected in text adventure games, and popularized several tag
lines that have become fixtures of hacker-speak: "A huge green fierce snake
bars the way!" "I see no X here" (for some noun X). "You are in a maze of
twisty little passages, all alike." "You are in a little maze of twisty
passages, all different." The `magic words' {xyzzy} and {plugh} also derive
from this game. Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
Mammoth & Flint Ridge cave system; it actually *has* a `Colossal Cave' and a
`Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon
for a map reference to a secondary entrance.
