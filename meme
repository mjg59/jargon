 MEME (meem) [coined on analogy with `gene' by Richard Dawkins] n. An idea
considered as a REPLICATOR. Used esp. in the prase `meme complex' denoting a
group of mutually supporting memes which form an organized belief system,
such as a religion. This dictionary is a vector of the "hacker subculture"
meme complex; each entry might be considered a meme. However, "meme" is often
misused to mean "meme complex". Use of the term connotes acceptance of the
idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using sentients)
cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has superseded biological
evolution by selection of hereditary traits.
