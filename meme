 :meme: /meem/, n. [coined by analogy with `gene', by Richard Dawkins] An
idea considered as a {replicator}, esp. with the connotation that memes
parasitize people into propagating them much as viruses do. Used esp. in the
phrase meme complex denoting a group of mutually supporting memes that form
an organized belief system, such as a religion. This lexicon is an
(epidemiological) vector of the `hacker subculture' meme complex; each entry
might be considered a meme. However, meme is often misused to mean meme
complex. Use of the term connotes acceptance of the idea that in humans (and
presumably other tool- and language-using sophonts) cultural evolution by
selection of adaptive ideas has superseded biological evolution by selection
of hereditary traits. Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably obvious
reasons.
