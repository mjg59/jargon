 :replicator: /n./ Any construct that acts to produce copies of itself; this
could be a living organism, an idea (see {meme}), a program (see {quine},
{worm}, {wabbit}, {fork bomb}, and {virus}), a pattern in a cellular
automaton (see {life}, sense 1), or (speculatively) a robot or {nanobot}. It
is even claimed by some that {{Unix}} and {C} are the symbiotic halves of an
extremely successful replicator; see {Unix conspiracy}.
