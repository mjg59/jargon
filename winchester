 :Winchester:: n. Informal generic term for sealed-enclosure magnetic-disk
drives in which the read-write head planes over the disk surface on an air
cushion. There is a legend that the name arose because the original 1973
engineering prototype for what later became the IBM 3340 featured two
30-megabyte volumes; 30-30 became `Winchester' when somebody noticed the
similarity to the common term for a famous Winchester rifle (in the latter,
the first 30 referred to caliber and the second to the grain weight of the
charge). (It is sometimes incorrectly claimed that Winchester was the
laboratory in which the technology was developed.)
