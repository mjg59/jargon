 LINK FARM (link farm) [UNIX] n. A directory tree that contains many links to
files another, master directory tree of files. Link farms save space when
maintaining several nearly identical copies of the same source tree, e.g.
when the only difference is architecture-dependent object files. Example use:
`Let's freeze the source and then rebuild the FROBOZZ-3 and FROBOZZ-4 link
farms.' Link farms may also be used to get around restrictions on the number
of -I arguments on older C preprocessors.
