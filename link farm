 :link farm: [UNIX] n. A directory tree that contains many links to files in
a master directory tree of files. Link farms save space when (for example)
one is maintaining several nearly identical copies of the same source tree,
e.g., when the only difference is architecture-dependent object files. "Let's
freeze the source and then rebuild the FROBOZZ-3 and FROBOZZ-4 link farms."
Link farms may also be used to get around restrictions on the number of `-I'
(include-file directory) arguments on older C preprocessors. However, they
can also get completely out of hand, becoming the filesystem equivalent of
{spaghetti code}.
