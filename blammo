 :blammo: /v./ [Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To forcibly remove
someone from any interactive system, especially talker systems. The
operators, who may remain hidden, may `blammo' a user who is misbehaving.
Very similar to MIT {gun}; in fact, the `blammo-gun' is a notional device
used to `blammo' someone. While in actual fact the only incarnation of the
blammo-gun is the command used to forcibly eject a user, operators speak of
different levels of blammo-gun fire; e.g., a blammo-gun to `stun' will
temporarily remove someone, but a blammo-gun set to `maim' will stop someone
coming back on for a while.
