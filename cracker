 :cracker: /n./ One who breaks security on a system. Coined ca. 1985 by
hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of {hacker} (q.v., sense 8).
An earlier attempt to establish `worm' in this sense around 1981--82 on
Usenet was largely a failure. Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong
revulsion against the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings.
While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past {larval stage}
is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for immediate,
benign, practical reasons (for example, if it's necessary to get around some
security in order to get some work done). Thus, there is far less overlap
between hackerdom and crackerdom than the {mundane} reader misled by
sensationalistic journalism might expect. Crackers tend to gather in small,
tight-knit, very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge,
open poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
describe *themselves* as hackers, most true hackers consider them a separate
and lower form of life. Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that
anyone who can't imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers
than breaking into someone else's has to be pretty {losing}. Some other
reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the entries on
{cracking} and {phreaking}. see also {samurai}, {dark-side hacker}, and
{hacker ethic}. For a portrait of the typical teenage cracker, see {warez
d00dz}.
