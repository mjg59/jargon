 CP/M (see-pee-em) [Control Program for Microcomputers] An early
microcomputer OS written by hacker Gary Kildall for Z-80 based machines, very
popular in the late 1970s until virtually wiped out by MS-DOS after the
release of the IBM PC in 1981 (legend has it that Kildall's company blew
their chance to write the PC's OS because Kildall decided to spend the day
IBM's reps wanted to meet with him enjoying the perfect flying weather in his
private plane). Many of its features and conventions strongly resemble those
of early DEC operating systems such as OS9, RSTS and RSX-11. see MS-DOS,
OPERATING SYSTEM. CRACKER (krak'r) n. One who breaks security on a system.
Coined c. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of HACKER,
see definition #6.
