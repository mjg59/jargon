 :slack: n. 1. Space allocated to a disk file but not actually used to store
useful information. The techspeak equivalent is `internal fragmentation'.
Antonym: {hole}. 2. In the theology of the {Church of the SubGenius}, a
mystical substance or quality that is the prerequisite of all human
happiness. Since Unix files are stored compactly, except for the unavoidable
wastage in the last block or fragment, it might be said that "Unix has no
slack". see {ha ha only serious}.
