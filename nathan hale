 :Nathan Hale: n. An asterisk (see also {splat}, {ASCII}). Oh, you want an
etymology? Notionally, from "I regret that I have only one asterisk for my
country!", a misquote of the famous remark uttered by Nathan Hale just before
he was hanged. Hale was a (failed) spy for the rebels in the American War of
Independence.
