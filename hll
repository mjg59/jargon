 HLL /aych-el-el/ n. [High-Level Language (as opposed to assembler)] Found
primarily in email and news rather than speech. Rarely, the variants `VHLL'
and `MLL' are found. VHLL = `Very-High-Level Language' and is used to
describe a BONDAGE-AND-DISCIPLINE LANGUAGE that the speaker happens to like;
Prolog and Backus's FP are often called VHLLs. `MLL' = `Medium-Level
Language' and is sometimes used half-jokingly to describe C, alluding to its
`structured-assembler' image. see also LANGUAGES OF CHOICE.
