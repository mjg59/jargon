 :HLL: /H·L·L/, n. [High-Level Language (as opposed to assembler)] Found
primarily in email and news rather than speech. Rarely, the variants `VHLL'
and `MLL' are found. VHLL stands for `Very-High-Level Language' and is used
to describe a {bondage-and-discipline language} that the speaker happens to
like; Prolog and Backus's FP are often called VHLLs. `MLL' stands for
`Medium-Level Language' and is sometimes used half-jokingly to describe {C},
alluding to its `structured-assembler' image. see also {languages of choice}.
