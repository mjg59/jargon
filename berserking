 :berserking: vi. A {MUD} term meaning to gain points *only* by killing other
players and mobiles (non-player characters). Hence, a Berserker-Wizard is a
player character that has achieved enough points to become a wizard, but only
by killing other characters. Berserking is sometimes frowned upon because of
its inherently antisocial nature, but some MUDs have a `berserker mode' in
which a player becomes *permanently* berserk, can never flee from a fight,
cannot use magic, gets no score for treasure, but does get double kill
points. "Berserker wizards can seriously damage your elf!"
