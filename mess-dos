 MESS-DOS /mes-dos/ [UNIX hackers] n. Derisory term for MS-DOS. Often
followed by the ritual expurgation "Just Say No!". see MS-DOS. Most hackers
(even many MS-DOS hackers) loathe MS-DOS for its single-tasking nature, its
limits on application size, its nasty primitive interface, and its ties to
IBMness (see FEAR AND LOATHING). Also "mess-loss", "messy-dos", "mess-dog"
"mess-loss" "mess-dross" and various combinations thereof.
