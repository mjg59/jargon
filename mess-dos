 :mess-dos: /mes-dos/ n. [semi-obsolescent now that DOS is] Derisory term for
MS-DOS. Often followed by the ritual banishing "Just say No!" see {{MS-DOS}}.
Most hackers (even many MS-DOS hackers) loathed MS-DOS for its single-tasking
nature, its limits on application size, its nasty primitive interface, and
its ties to IBMness and Microsoftness (see {fear and loathing}). Also
`mess-loss', `messy-dos', `mess-dog', `mess-dross', `mush-dos', and various
combinations thereof. In Ireland and the U.K. it is even sometimes called
`Domestos' after a brand of toilet cleanser.
