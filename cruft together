 :cruft together: vt. (also `cruft up') To throw together something ugly but
temporarily workable. Like vt. {kluge up}, but more pejorative. "There isn't
any program now to reverse all the lines of a file, but I can probably cruft
one together in about 10 minutes." see {hack together}, {hack up}, {kluge
up}, {crufty}.
