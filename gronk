 :gronk: /gronk/ /vt./ [popularized by Johnny Hart's comic strip "B.C." but
the word apparently predates that] 1. To clear the state of a wedged device
and restart it. More severe than `to {frob}' (sense 2). 2. [TMRC] To cut,
sever, smash, or similarly disable. 3. The sound made by many 3.5-inch
diskette drives. In particular, the microfloppies on a Commodore Amiga go
"grink, gronk".
