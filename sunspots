 SUNSPOTS n. Notional cause of an odd error. "Why did the program suddenly
turn the screen blue?" "Sunspots, I guess". Also cause of bitrot, from the
genuine, honest-to-god fact that sunspots will increase cosmic radiation
which can flip single bits in memory. Needless to say, although real sunspot
errors happen, they are extremely rare. see PHASE OF THE MOON.
