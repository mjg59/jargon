 :black hat: 1. [common among security specialists] A {cracker}, someone bent
on breaking into the system you are protecting. Oppose the less comon white
hat for an ally or friendly security specialist; the term gray hat is in
occasional use for people with cracker skills operating within the law, e.g.
in doing security evaluations. All three terms derive from the dress code of
formulaic Westerns, in which bad guys wore black hats and good guys white
ones. 2. [spamfighters] `Black hat', `white hat', and `gray hat' are also
used to denote the spam-friendliness of ISPs: a black hat ISP harbors
spammers and doesn't terminate them; a white hat ISP terminates upon the
first LART; and gray hat ISPs terminate only reluctantly and/or slowly. This
has led to the concept of a hat check: someone considering a potential
business relationship with an ISP or other provider will post a query to a
{NANA} group, asking about the provider's hat color. The term albedo has also
been used to describe a provider's spam-friendliness.
