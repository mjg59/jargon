 :black hat: [common among security specialists] A {cracker}, someone bent on
breaking into the system you are protecting. Oppose the less comon `white
hat' for an ally or friendly security specialist; the term `gray hat' is in
occasional use for people with cracker skills operating within the law, e.g.
in doing security evaluations. All three terms derive from the dress code of
formulaic Westerns, in which bad guys wore black hats and good guys white
ones.
