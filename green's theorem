 :Green's Theorem: [TMRC] prov. For any story, in any group of people there
will be at least one person who has not heard the story. A refinement of the
theorem states that there will be *exactly* one person (if there were more
than one, it wouldn't be as bad to re-tell the story). [The name of this
theorem is a play on a fundamental theorem in calculus. --- ESR]
