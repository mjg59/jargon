 :RTM: /R-T-M/ [Usenet: abbreviation for `Read The Manual'] 1. Politer
variant of {RTFM}. 2. Robert Tappan Morris, perpetrator of the great Internet
worm of 1988 (see {Great Worm}); villain to many, naive hacker gone wrong to
a few. Morris claimed that the worm that brought the Internet to its knees
was a benign experiment that got out of control as the result of a coding
error. After the storm of negative publicity that followed this blunder,
Morris's username on ITS was hacked from RTM to {RTFM}.
