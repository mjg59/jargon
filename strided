 :strided: /str:'d*d/ adj. [scientific computing] Said of a sequence of
memory reads and writes to addresses, each of which is separated from the
last by a constant interval called the `stride length'. These can be a
worst-case access pattern for the standard memory-caching schemes when the
stride length is a multiple of the cache line size. Strided references are
often generated by loops through an array, and (if your data is large enough
that access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to tune for better
locality by inverting double loops or by partially unrolling the outer loop
of a loop nest. This usage is borderline techspeak; the related term `memory
stride' is definitely techspeak.
