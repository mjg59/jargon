 :has the X nature: [seems to derive from Zen Buddhist koans of the form
"Does an X have the Buddha-nature?"] adj. Common hacker construction for `is
an X', used for humorous emphasis. "Anyone who can't even use a program with
on-screen help embedded in it truly has the {loser} nature!" see also {the X
that can be Y is not the true X}.
