 INTERCAL: /in't*r-kal/ [said by the authors to stand for `Compiler Language
With No Pronounceable Acronym'] n. A computer language designed by Don Woods
and James Lyon in 1972. INTERCAL is purposely different from all other
computer languages in all ways but one; it is purely a written language,
being totally unspeakable. An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will
make the style of the language clear: It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated
fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem. For
example, if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536
in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is: DO :1 <- #0$#256 any sensible programmer
would say that that was absurd. Since this is indeed the simplest method, the
programmer would be made to look foolish in front of his boss, who would of
course have happened to turn up, as bosses are wont to do. The effect would
be no less devastating for the programmer having been correct. INTERCAL has
many other peculiar features designed to make it even more unspeakable. The
Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many (well, at least several)
people at Princeton. The language has been recently reimplemented as
C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an unprecedented level of
unpopularity; there is even an alt.lang.intercal newsgroup devoted to the
study and ... appreciation of the language on USENET. interesting: adj. In
hacker parlance, this word has strong connotations of `annoying', or
`difficult', or both. Hackers relish a challenge, and enjoy wringing all the
irony possible out of the ancient Chinese curse "May you live in interesting
times". Oppose {trivial}, {uninteresting}. Internet address:: n. 1.
[techspeak] An absolute network address of the form foo@bar.baz, where foo is
a user name, bar is a {sitename}, and baz is a `domain' name, possibly
including periods itself. Contrast with {bang path}; see also {network, the}
and {network address}. All Internet machines and most UUCP sites can now
resolve these addresses, thanks to a large amount of behind-the-scenes magic
and PD software written since 1980 or so. see also {bang path}, {domainist}.
2. More loosely, any network address reachable through Internet; this
includes {bang path} addresses and some internal corporate and government
networks. Reading Internet addresses is something of an art. Here are the
four most important top-level functional Internet domains followed by a
selection of geographical domains: com commercial organizations edu
educational institutions gov U.S. government civilian sites mil U.S. military
sites Note that most of the sites in the com and edu domains are in the U.S.
or Canada. us sites in the U.S. outside the functional domains su sites in
the Soviet Union (see {kremvax}). uk sites in the United Kingdom Within the
us domain, there are subdomains for the fifty states, each generally with a
name identical to the state's postal abbreviation. Within the uk domain,
there is an ac subdomain for academic sites and a co domain for commercial
ones. Other top-level domains may be divided up in similar ways. interrupt:
1. [techspeak] n. On a computer, an event that interrupts normal processing
and temporarily diverts flow-of-control through an "interrupt handler"
routine. see also {trap}. 2. interj. A request for attention from a hacker.
Often explicitly spoken. "Interrupt --- have you seen Joe recently?" see
{priority interrupt}. 3. Under MS-DOS, the term `interrupt' is nearly
synonymous with `system call', because the OS and BIOS routines are both
called using the INT instruction (see {{interrupt list, the}}) and because
programmers so often have to bypass the OS (going directly to a BIOS
interrupt) to get reasonable performance. interrupt list, the:: [MS-DOS] n.
The list of all known software interrupt calls (both documented and
undocumented) for IBM PCs and compatibles, maintained and made available for
free redistribution by Ralf Brown (ralf@cs.cmu.edu). As of early 1991, it had
grown to approximately a megabyte in length. interrupts locked out: When
someone is ignoring you. In a restaurant, after several fruitless attempts to
get the waitress's attention, a hacker might well observe "She must have
interrupts locked out". The synonym `interrupts disabled' is also common.
Variations of this abound; "to have one's interrupt mask bit set" or
"interrupts masked out" is also heard. see also {spl}. iron: n. Hardware,
especially older and larger hardware of {mainframe} class with big metal
cabinets housing relatively low-density electronics (but the term is also
used of modern supercomputers). Often in the phrase {big iron}. Oppose
{silicon}. see also {dinosaur}. Iron Age: n. In the history of computing,
1961--1971 --- the formative era of commercial {mainframe} technology, when
{big iron} {dinosaur}s ruled the earth. These began with the delivery of the
first PDP-1, coincided with the dominance of ferrite {core}, and ended with
the introduction of the first commercial microprocessor (the Intel 4004) in
1971. see also {Stone Age}; compare {elder days}. iron box: [UNIX/Internet]
n. A special environment set up to trap a {cracker} logging in over remote
connections long enough to be traced. May include a modified {shell}
restricting the hacker's movements in unobvious ways, and `bait' files
designed to keep him interested and logged on. see also {back door},
{firewall machine}, {Venus flytrap}, and Clifford Stoll's account in `The
Cuckoo's Egg' of how he made and used one (see the Bibliography). Compare
{padded cell}. ironmonger: [IBM] n. Derogatory. A hardware specialist.
Compare {sandbender}, {polygon pusher}.
