 TENSE adj. Of programs, very clever and efficient. A tense piece of code
often got that way because it was highly BUMMED, but sometimes it was just
based on a great idea. A comment in a clever display routine by Mike Kazar, a
student hacker at CMU: "This routine is so tense it will bring tears to your
eyes. Much thanks to Craig Everhart and James Gosling for inspiring this HACK
ATTACK." A tense programmer is one who produces tense code.
