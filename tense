 :tense: adj. Of programs, very clever and efficient. A tense piece of code
often got that way because it was highly tuned, but sometimes it was just
based on a great idea. A comment in a clever routine by Mike Kazar, once a
grad-student hacker at CMU: "This routine is so tense it will bring tears to
your eyes." A tense programmer is one who produces tense code.
