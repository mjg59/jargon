 :ken: /ken/, n. 1. [Unix] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of Unix. In the
early days he used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that
read "Love, ken". Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes
uncapitalized, because it's a login name and mail address) in third-person
reference; it is widely understood (on Usenet, in particular) that without a
last name `Ken' refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, `Dennis' without last
name means Dennis Ritchie (and he is often known as dmr). see also {demigod},
{Unix}. 2. A flaming user. This was originated by the Software Support group
at Symbolics because the two greatest flamers in the user community were both
named Ken.
