 :ken: /ken/ n. 1. [UNIX] Ken Thompson, principal inventor of UNIX. In the
early days he used to hand-cut distribution tapes, often with a note that
read "Love, ken". Old-timers still use his first name (sometimes
uncapitalized, because it's a login name and mail address) in third-person
reference; it is widely understood (on USENET, in particular) that without a
last name `Ken' refers only to Ken Thompson. Similarly, Dennis without last
name means Dennis Ritchie (and he is often known as dmr). see also {demigod},
{{UNIX}}. 2. A flaming user. This was originated by the Software Support
group at Symbolics because the two greatest flamers in the user community
were both named Ken.
