 :swizzle: /v./ To convert external names, array indices, or references
within a data structure into address pointers when the data structure is
brought into main memory from external storage (also called `pointer
swizzling'); this may be done for speed in chasing references or to simplify
code (e.g., by turning lots of name lookups into pointer dereferences). The
converse operation is sometimes termed `unswizzling'. see also {snap}.
