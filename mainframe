 :mainframe: n. Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the
central processor unit or `main frame' of a room-filling {Stone Age} batch
machine. After the emergence of smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early
1970s, the traditional {big iron} machines were described as `mainframe
computers' and eventually just as mainframes. The term carries the
connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive use,
though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating system retrofitted
onto it; it is especially used of machines built by IBM, Unisys, and the
other great {dinosaur}s surviving from computing's {Stone Age}. It has been
common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that the mainframe
architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside of the tiny market for
{number-crunching} supercomputers (see {cray})), having been swamped by the
recent huge advances in IC technology and low-cost personal computing. As of
1993, corporate America is just beginning to figure this out -- the wave of
failures, takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers have
certainly provided sufficient omens (see {dinosaurs mating} and {killer
micro}).
