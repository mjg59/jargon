 :mainframe: n. Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the
central processor unit or `main frame' of a room-filling {Stone Age} batch
machine. After the emergence of smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early
1970s, the traditional {big iron} machines were described as `mainframe
computers' and eventually just as mainframes. The term carries the
connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive use,
though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating system retrofitted
onto it; it is especially used of machines built by IBM, Unisys, and the
other great {dinosaur}s surviving from computing's {Stone Age}. It is common
wisdom among hackers that the mainframe architectural tradition is
essentially dead (outside of the tiny market for {number-crunching}
supercomputers (see {cray})), having been swamped by the recent huge advances
in IC technology and low-cost personal computing. As of 1991, corporate
America hasn't quite figured this out yet, though the wave of failures,
takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers are certainly
straws in the wind (see {dinosaurs mating}).
