 GET A REAL COMPUTER (get uh reel kuhm'pyoo-tr) imp. Typical hacker response
to news that somebody is having trouble getting work done on a system that is
a) single- tasking, b) has no Winchester, or c) has less than a megabyte of
DRAM. This is as of 1990; note that the threshold for `real computer' rises
with time, and it may well be (for example) that machines with character-only
displays will be considered `unreal' in five years. see BITTY BOX and TOY.
