 GET A REAL COMPUTER imp. Typical hacker response to news that somebody is
having trouble getting work done on a system that is a) single-tasking, b)
has no Winchester, or c) has an address space smaller than 4 megabytes. This
is as of 1990; note that the threshold for `real computer' rises with time,
and it may well be (for example) that machines with character-only displays
will be considered `unreal' in a few years. see BITTY BOX and TOY.
