 :Great Worm, the: n. The 1988 Internet {worm} perpetrated by {RTM}. This is
a play on Tolkien (compare {elvish}, {Elder Days}). In the fantasy history of
his Middle Earth books, there were dragons powerful enough to lay waste to
entire regions; two of these (Scatha and Glaurung) were known as "the Great
Worms". This usage expresses the connotation that the RTM hack was a sort of
devastating watershed event in hackish history; certainly it did more to make
non-hackers nervous about the Internet than anything before or since.
