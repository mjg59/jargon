 :Food: ====== Ethnic. Spicy. Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan,
Hunan, and Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely d'eclass'e). Hackers
prefer the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will eat
with gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale. Thai
food has experienced flurries of popularity. Where available, high-quality
Jewish delicatessen food is much esteemed. A visible minority of Southwestern
and Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican. For those all-night hacks, pizza
and microwaved burritos are big. Interestingly, though the mainstream culture
has tended to think of hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have
at least mildly health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about
what they eat. This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark 10--15 years ago. :Politics: ==========
Vaguely left of center, except for the strong libertarian contingent which
rejects conventional left-right politics entirely. The only safe
generalization is that hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; thus,
both conventional conservatism and `hard' leftism are rare. Hackers are far
more likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or
(b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to
live by them day-to-day. :Gender and Ethnicity: ======================
Hackerdom is still predominantly male. However, the percentage of women is
clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical
professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with as
equals. In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong
minorities of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast). The Jewish
contingent has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see
{Food}, above, and note that several common jargon terms are obviously
mutated Yiddish). The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to
be a function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education. Racial
and ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing
contempt. When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this
is doubtless a powerful influence. Also, the ties many hackers have to AI
research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of
personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive --- after all, if one's
imagination readily grants full human rights to AI programs, robots,
dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very
important any more. :Religion: ========== Agnostic. Atheist. Non-observant
Jewish. Neo-pagan. Very commonly, three or more of these are combined in the
same person. Conventional faith-holding Christianity is rare though not
unknown. Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be
relaxed about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of
religious bigotry in particular. Many enjoy `parody' religions such as
Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius. Also, many hackers are
influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or (less commonly) Taoism, and
blend them easily with their `native' religions. There is a definite strain
of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that shows up even among those
hackers not actively involved with neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen.
Hacker folklore that pays homage to `wizards' and speaks of incantations and
demons has too much psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a
joke. :Ceremonial Chemicals: ====================== Most hackers don't smoke
tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at all (though there is a visible
contingent of exotic-beer fanciers, and a few hackers are serious
oenophiles). Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as
cannabis, LSD, psilocybin, and nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively
common and is still regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream
culture. Use of `downers' and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be
particularly rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that `dumb them
down'. On the third hand, many hackers regularly wire up on caffeine and/or
sugar for all-night hacking runs. :Communication Style: =====================
see the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of this
File. Though hackers often have poor person-to-person communication skills,
they are as a rule extremely sensitive to nuances of language and very
precise in their use of it. They are often better at writing than at
speaking. :Geographical Distribution: =========================== In the
United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis; about half of
the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of Cambridge
(Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although there are significant
contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest, and around Washington
DC. Hackers tend to cluster around large cities, especially `university
towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or Princeton, New
Jersey (this may simply reflect the fact that many are students or
ex-students living near their alma maters). :Sexual Habits: ===============
Hackerdom tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle variation than
the mainstream culture. It includes a relatively large gay and bi contingent.
Hackers are somewhat more likely to live in polygynous or polyandrous
relationships, practice open marriage, or live in communes or group houses.
In this, as in general appearance, hackerdom semi-consciously maintains
`counterculture' values. :Personality Characteristics:
============================= The most obvious common `personality'
characteristics of hackers are high intelligence, consuming curiosity, and
facility with intellectual abstractions. Also, most hackers are `neophiles',
stimulated by and appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty).
Most are also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist. Although high
general intelligence is common among hackers, it is not the sine qua non one
might expect. Another trait is probably even more important: the ability to
mentally absorb, retain, and reference large amounts of `meaningless' detail,
trusting to later experience to give it context and meaning. A person of
merely average analytical intelligence who has this trait can become an
effective hacker, but a creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find
himself outdistanced by people who routinely upload the contents of thick
reference manuals into their brains. [During the production of the book
version of this document, for example, I learned most of the rather complex
typesetting language TeX over about four working days, mainly by inhaling
Knuth's 477-page manual. My editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely
surprised me, because years of associating with hackers have conditioned me
to consider such performances routine and to be expected. --- ESR] Contrary
to stereotype, hackers are *not* usually intellectually narrow; they tend to
be interested in any subject that can provide mental stimulation, and can
often discourse knowledgeably and even interestingly on any number of obscure
subjects --- if you can get them to talk at all, as opposed to, say, going
back to their hacking. It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders'
expectations) that the better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or
she is to have outside interests at which he or she is more than merely
competent. Hackers are `control freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with
the usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same way
that children delight in making model trains go forward and back by moving a
switch, hackers love making complicated things like computers do nifty stuff
for them. But it has to be *their* nifty stuff. They don't like tedium,
nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring, ill-defined little tasks that
go with maintaining a normal existence. Accordingly, they tend to be careful
and orderly in their intellectual lives and chaotic elsewhere. Their code
will be beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap. Hackers
are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards such as
social approval or money. They tend to be attracted by challenges and excited
by interesting toys, and to judge the interest of work or other activities in
terms of the challenges offered and the toys they get to play with. In terms
of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom appears to
concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, introverted,
intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed to the extroverted-sensate
personalities that predominate in the mainstream culture). ENT[JP] types are
also concentrated among hackers but are in a minority. :Weaknesses of the
Hacker Personality: ====================================== Hackers have
relatively little ability to identify emotionally with other people. This may
be because hackers generally aren't much like `other people'. Unsurprisingly,
hackers also tend towards self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and
impatience with people and tasks perceived to be wasting their time. As
cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the world,
they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational, `cool', and
imaginative as they consider themselves. This bias often contributes to
weakness in communication skills. Hackers tend to be especially poor at
confrontation and negotiation. Because of their passionate embrace of (what
they consider to be) the {Right Thing}, hackers can be unfortunately
intolerant and bigoted on technical issues, in marked contrast to their
general spirit of camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints
otherwise. Old-time {{ITS}} partisans look down on the ever-growing hordes of
{{UNIX}} hackers; UNIX aficionados despise {VMS} and {{MS-DOS}}; and hackers
who are used to conventional command-line user interfaces loathe
mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh. Hackers who don't indulge
in {USENET} consider it a huge waste of time and {bandwidth}; fans of old
adventure games such as {ADVENT} and {Zork} consider {MUD}s to be glorified
chat systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting puzzles; hackers who are
willing to devote endless hours to USENET or MUDs consider {IRC} to be a
*real* waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay if there weren't all
those silly puzzles in the way. And, of course, there are the perennial {holy
wars} -- {EMACS} vs. {vi}, {big-endian} vs. {little-endian}, RISC vs. CISC,
etc., etc., etc. As in society at large, the intensity and duration of these
debates is usually inversely proportional to the number of objective, factual
arguments available to buttress any position. As a result of all the above
traits, many hackers have difficulty maintaining stable relationships. At
worst, they can produce the classic {computer geek}: withdrawn, relationally
incompetent, sexually frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged
in his or her craft. Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than
mainstream folklore paints it --- but almost all hackers will recognize
something of themselves in the unflattering paragraphs above. Hackers are
often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing with the physical
world. Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles up to incredible heights
in homes and offices, and minor maintenance tasks get deferred indefinitely.
The sort of person who uses phrases like `incompletely socialized' usually
thinks hackers are. Hackers regard such people with contempt when they notice
them at all.
