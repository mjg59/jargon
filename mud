currency there and IMHO is common; conversely, most of the people who know

community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more
natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the `social' list
above; specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW,
WTF, TTFN, and WTH. The use of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are
fond of re- compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see
{bonk/oif}) people. The word `re' by itself is taken as `regreet'. In
