 :MUD: /muhd/ [acronym, Multi-User Dungeon; alt. Multi-User Dimension] 1. n.
A class of {virtual reality} experiments accessible via the Internet. These
are real-time chat forums with structure; they have multiple `locations' like
an adventure game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a simple
economic system, and the capability for characters to build more structure
onto the database that represents the existing world. 2. vi. To play a MUD
(see {hack-and-slay}). The acronym MUD is often lowercased and/or verbed;
thus, one may speak of `going mudding', etc. Historically, MUDs (and their
more recent progeny with names of MU- form) derive from a hack by Richard
Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early
1980s; descendants of that game still exist today (see {BartleMUD}). There is
a widespread myth (repeated, unfortunately, by earlier versions of this
lexicon) that the name MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by
Bartle on British Telecom (the motto: "You haven't *lived* 'til you've *died*
on MUD!"); however, this is false --- Richard Bartle explicitly placed `MUD'
in PD in 1985. BT was upset at this, as they had already printed trademark
claims on some maps and posters, which were released and created the myth.
Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the MUD
concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD). Many of these
had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction. Because these
had an image as `research' they often survived administrative hostility to
BBSs in general. This, together with the fact that USENET feeds have been
spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made the MUDs major foci of hackish
social interaction there. AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic
around 1988 and quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for
large hacker communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some
observers see parallels with the growth of USENET in the early 1980s). The
second wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social
interaction, puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and
competition. In 1991, over 50% of MUD sites are of a third major variety,
LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and older
systems with the extensibility of TinyMud. The trend toward greater
programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue. The state of the art
in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with new simulation designs
appearing (seemingly) every month. There is now (early 1991) a move afoot to
deprecate the term {MUD} itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding
variety of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
explored. see also {BartleMUD}, {berserking}, {bonk/oif}, {brand brand
