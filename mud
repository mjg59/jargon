 MUD: [abbr: Multi User Dungeon] 1. A class of {virtual reality} experiments
accessible via {Internet}. These are real-time chat forums with structure;
they have multiple `locations' like an adventure game and may include combat,
traps, puzzles, magic, a simple economic system, and the capability for
characters to build more structure onto the database that represents the
existing world. 2. vi. To play a MUD (see {hack-and-slay}). The acronym MUD
is often lower-cased and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of `going mudding',
etc. Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
form) derive from an AI experiment by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s, and descendants of that game
still exist today (see {BartleMUD}). The title `MUD' is still copyright to
the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (their motto: "You
haven't *lived* `til you've *died* on MUD"); however, this did not stop
students on the European academic networks from copying/improving on the MUD
concept, from which sprung several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD). Many of
these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction. Because
USENET feeds have been spotty and difficult to get in Great Britain and the
British JANET network doesn't support {FTP} or {telnet}, the MUDs became
major foci of hackish social interaction there. LPMUD and other variants
crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and quickly gained popularity in the US;
they became nuclei for large hacker communities with only loose ties to
traditional hackerdom (some observers see parallels with the growth of USENET
in the early 1980s). More recent MUDs (such as TinyMud), esp. in the US, have
tended to emphasize social interaction, puzzles, and cooperative
world-building as opposed to combat and competition. Whether this represents
a genuine long-term trend is hard to say; the state of the art in MUD design
is still moving very rapidly, with new simulation designs appearing
(seemingly) every month. There is now (early 1991) a move afoot to deprecate
the term {MUD} itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding variety of names
corresponding to the different simulation styles being explored. see also
{BartleMUD}, {berserking}, {bonk/oif}, {brand brand brand}, {FOD},
{hack-and-slay}, {mudhead}, {posing}, {talk mode}, {tinycrud}. mudhead: n.
Commonly used to refer to a {MUD} player who sleeps, breathes, and eats MUD.
Mudheads have frequently been known to fail their degrees, drop out, etc.,
with the consolation, however, that they made wizard level. When encountered
in person, all a mudhead will talk about is two topics: the tactic,
character, or wizard that in his view is always unfairly stopping him/her
becoming wizard or beating a favorite MUD, and the MUD he is writing/going to
write because all existing MUDs are so dreadful! see also {wannabee}.
multician: /muhl-ti'shn/ [coined at Honeywell, c.1970] n. Competent user of
{Multics}. Multics: /muhl'tiks/ n. [from "MULTiplexed Information and
Computing Service"] An early (late 1960s) timesharing operating system
co-designed by a consortium including MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories, very
innovative for its time (among other things, it introduced the idea of
treating all devices uniformly as special files). All the members but GE
eventually pulled out after determining that {second-system effect} had
bloated Multics to the point of practical unusability (the `lean' predecessor
in question was {CTSS}). Honeywell commercialized Multics after buying out
GE's computer group, but it was never very successful (among other things, on
some versions one was commonly required to enter a password to log out). One
of the developers left in the lurch by the project's breakup was Ken
Thompson, a circumstance which led directly to the birth of {UNIX}. For this
and other reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
debate among hackers. see also {brain-damaged}. multitask: n. Often used of
humans in the same meaning it has for computers, to describe a person doing
several things at once (but see {thrash}). The term `multiplex' from
communications technology (meaning to handle more than one channel at the
same time) is used similarly. mumblage: /muhm'bl@j/ n. The topic of one's
mumbling (see {mumble}). "All that mumblage" is used like "all that stuff"
when it is not quite clear what it is or how it works, or like "all that
crap" when "mumble" is being used as an implicit replacement for obscenities.
mumble: interj. 1. Said when the correct response is either too complicated
to enunciate or the speaker has not thought it out. Often prefaces a longer
answer, or indicates a general reluctance to get into a big long discussion.
"Don't you think that we could improve LISP performance by using a hybrid
reference-count transaction garbage collector, if the cache is big enough and
there are some extra cache bits for the microcode to use?" "Well, mumble...
I'll have to think about it." 2. Sometimes used as an expression of
disagreement. "I think we should buy a {VAX}." "Mumble!" Common variant:
`mumble frotz' (see {frotz}; interestingly, one does not say `mumble
frobnitz' even though frotz is short for `frobnitz'). 3. Yet another
metasyntactic variable, like {foo}. munch: [often confused with `mung', q.v.]
vt. To transform information in a serial fashion, often requiring large
amounts of computation. To trace down a data structure. Related to {crunch}
and nearly synonymous with {grovel}, but connotes less pain. munching
squares: n. A {display hack} dating back to the PDP-1 (c.1962, allegedly
invented by one Jackson Wright), which employs a trivial computation
(repeatedly plotting the graph Y = X XOR T for successive values of T --- see
{HAKMEM} items 146-148) to produce an impressive display of moving and
growing squares that devour the screen. The initial value of T is treated as
a parameter which when well-chosen can produce amazing effects. Some of
these, later (re)discovered on the LISP machine, have been christened
`munching triangles' (try AND for XOR and toggling points instead of plotting
them), `munching w's', and `munching mazes'. More generally, suppose a
graphics program produces an impressive and ever-changing display of some
basic form foo on a display terminal, and does it using a relatively simple
program; then the program (or the resulting display) is likely to be referred
to as "munching foos" (this is a good example of the use of the word {foo} as
a metasyntactic variable). munchkin: /muhnch'kin/ [from the squeaky-voiced
little people in L. Frank Baum's `The Wizard of Oz'] n. A teenage-or-younger
micro enthusiast bashing BASIC or something else equally constricted. A term
of mild derision --- munchkins are annoying but some grow up to be hackers
after passing through a {larval stage}. The term {urchin} is also used. see
also {wannabee}, {bitty box}. mundane: [from SF fandom] n. 1. A person who is
not in science fiction fandom. 2. A person who is not in the computer
industry. In this sense, most often an adjectival modifier as in "in my
mundane life...". This term is not necessarily as pejorative as it sounds.
mung: /muhng/ alt. `munge' /muhnj/ [in 1960 at MIT, `Mash Until No Good";
sometime after that the derivation from the recursive acronym `Mung Until No
Good' became standard] vt. 1. To make changes to a file, often large-scale,
usually irrevocable. Occasionally accidental. see {BLT}. 2. To destroy,
usually accidentally, occasionally maliciously. The system only mungs things
maliciously; this is a consequence of Murphy's Law. see {scribble}, {mangle},
{trash}. Reports from {USENET} suggest that the pronunciation /muhnj/ is now
usual in speech, but the spelling `mung' is still common in program comments.
3. The kind of beans of which the sprouts are used in Chinese food. (That's
their real name! Mung beans! Really!) Murphy's Law: n. The correct,
*original* Murphy's Law reads: "If there are two or more ways to do
something, and one of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone
will do it." This a principle of defensive design, cited here because it's
usually given in mutant forms which are less descriptive of the travails of
design for lusers. For example, you don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and
then label it THIS WAY UP; if it matters which way it's plugged in, then you
make the design asymmetrical. Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers
on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949
to test human acceleration tolerances. One experiment involved a set of 16
accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body. There were
two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody methodically
installed all 16 the wrong way around. Murphy then made the original form of
his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp) quoted at a
news conference a few days later. Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to
various technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering. Before too
many years had passed, variants had passed into the popular imagination,
mutating as they went. It has since been observed that the pop-culture
versions in the vein of "Anything that can go wrong, will" are the result of
Murphy's Law acting on itself! Music:: n. A common extracurricular interest
of hackers (compare {{Science-Fiction Fandom}}, {{Oriental Food}}; see also
{filk}). It is widely believed among hackers that there is a substantial
correlation between whatever mysterious traits underlie hacking ability (on
the one hand) and musical talent and sensitivity (on the other). It is
certainly the case that hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop
musical appreciation in unusual and interesting directions. Folk music is
very big in hacker circles; so is the sort of elaborate instrumental
jazz/rock that used to be called `progressive' and isn't recorded much any
more. Also, the hacker's musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with
equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Spirogyra, Scott Joplin, King
Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, or one of Bach's Brandenburg Concerti. It is also
apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher concentration of
talented amateur musicians than one would expect from a similar-sized control
group of {mundane} types. mutter: vt. To quietly enter a command not meant
for the ears, eyes or fingers of ordinary mortals. Frequently in `mutter an
{incantation}'. N - N: /en/ quant. 1. Some large and indeterminate number of
objects; "There were N bugs in that crock!"; also used in its original sense
of a variable name. 2. An arbitrarily large (and perhaps infinite) number;
"This crock has N bugs, as N goes to infinity". 3. A variable whose value is
specified by the current context. For example, when ordering a meal at a
restaurant, N may be understood to mean however many people there are at the
table. From the remark "We'd like to order N wonton soups and a family dinner
for N - 1", you can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only
soup, even though you don't know how many people there are (see
{great-wall}). A silly riddle: "How many computers does it take to shift the
bits in a register? N+1: N to hold all the bits still, and one to shove the
register over." 4. `Nth': adj. The ordinal counterpart of N. "Now for the Nth
and last time..." In the specific context "Nth-year grad student", N is
generally assumed to be at least 4, and is usually 5 or more (see {tenured
graduate student}). see also {random numbers}, {two-to-the-n}. nailed to the
wall: [like a trophy] adj. Said of a bug finally eliminated after protracted
and even heroic effort. naive: adj. Untutored in the perversities of some
particular program or system; one who still tries to do things in an
intuitive way, rather than the right way (in really good designs these
coincide, but most designs aren't `really good' in the appropriate sense).
This is completely unrelated to general maturity or competence or even
competence at any other program. It is a sad commentary on the primitive
state of computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed to
be `experienced user' but is really more like `cynical user'. naive user: 1.
n. A {luser}. Tends to imply someone who is ignorant mainly due to
experience; when applied to someone who *has* experience, there is a definite
implication of stupidity.
