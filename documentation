 :documentation: n. The multiple kilograms of macerated, pounded, steamed,
bleached, and pressed trees that accompany most modern software or hardware
products (see also {tree-killer}). Hackers seldom read paper documentation
and (too) often resist writing it; they prefer theirs to be terse and
on-line. A common comment on this predilection is "You can't {grep} dead
trees". see {drool-proof paper}, {verbiage}, {treeware}.
