 :paper-net: n. Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing
it to a very slow, low-reliability network. USENET {sig block}s not
uncommonly include a "Paper-Net:" header just before the sender's postal
address; common variants of this are "Papernet" and "P-Net". Compare
{voice-net}, {snail-mail}.
