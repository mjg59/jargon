 :paper-net: n. Hackish way of referring to the postal service, analogizing
it to a very slow, low-reliability network. Usenet {sig block}s sometimes
include a "Paper-Net:" header just before the sender's postal address; common
variants of this are "Papernet" and "P-Net". Note that the standard
{netiquette} guidelines discourage this practice as a waste of bandwidth,
since netters are quite unlikely to casually use postal addresses. Compare
{voice-net}, {snail-mail}, {P-mail}.
