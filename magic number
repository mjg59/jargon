 :magic number: [UNIX/C] n. 1. In source code, some non-obvious constant
whose value is significant to the operation of a program and that is inserted
inconspicuously in-line ({hardcoded}), rather than expanded in by a symbol
set by a commented `#define'. Magic numbers in this sense are bad style. 2. A
number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm in some opaque
way. The classic examples of these are the numbers used in hash or CRC
functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential generator for
pseudo-random numbers. This sense actually predates and was ancestral to the
more common sense 1. 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary
data file to indicate its type to a utility. Under UNIX, the system and
various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between
types of executable file by looking for a magic number. Once upon a time,
these magic numbers were PDP-11 branch instructions that skipped over header
data to the start of executable code; the 0407, for example, was octal for
`branch 16 bytes relative'. Nowadays only a {wizard} knows the spells to
create magic numbers. How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own?
Simple --- you pick one at random. see? It's magic!
