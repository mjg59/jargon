 :bottom-post: v. In a news or mail reply, to put the response to a news or
email message after the quoted content from the parent message. This is
correct form, and until around 2000 was so universal on the Internet that
neither the term `bottom-post' nor its antonym {top-post} existed. Hackers
consider that the best practice is actually to excerpt only the relevent
portions of the parent message, then intersperse the poster's response in
such a way that each section of response appears directly after the excerpt
it applies to. This reduces message bulk, keeps thread content in a logical
order, and facilitates reading.
