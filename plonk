 :plonk: /excl.,vt./ [Usenet: possibly influenced by British slang `plonk'
for cheap booze, or `plonker' for someone behaving stupidly (latter is lit.
equivalent to Yiddish `schmuck')] The sound a {newbie} makes as he falls to
the bottom of a {kill file}. While it originated in the {newsgroup}
talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") is now (1994) widespread
on Usenet as a form of public ridicule.
