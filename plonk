 :plonk: excl. [Usenet: possibly influenced by British slang `plonk' for
cheap booze, or `plonker' for someone behaving stupidly (latter is lit.
equivalent to Yiddish `schmuck')] The sound a {newbie} makes as he falls to
the bottom of a {kill file}. While it originated in the {newsgroup}
talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") now (1994) widespread on
Usenet as a term of public ridicule.
