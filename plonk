 :plonk: [USENET: possibly influenced by British slang `plonk' for cheap
booze, or `plonker' for someone behaving stupidly] The sound a {newbie} makes
as he falls to the bottom of a {kill file}. Used almost exclusively in the
{newsgroup} talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") is a form of
public ridicule.
