 :plonk: excl. [USENET: possibly influenced by British slang `plonk' for
cheap booze, or `plonker' for someone behaving stupidly] The sound a {newbie}
makes as he falls to the bottom of a {kill file}. While it originated in the
{newsgroup} talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") now (1994)
widespread on USENET as a term of public ridicule.
