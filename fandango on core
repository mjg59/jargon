 FANDANGO ON CORE [UNIX/C hackers, from the Mexican dance] n. In C, a wild
pointer that runs out of bounds causing a CORE DUMP, or corrupts the
malloc(3) ARENA in such a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is
sometimes said to have `done a fandango on core'. On low-end personal
machines without an MMU this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive
lossage. Other third-world dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha or watusi may
be substituted. see ALIASING BUG, PRECEDENCE LOSSAGE, SMASH THE STACK, MEMORY
