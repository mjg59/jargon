 :fandango on core: n. [UNIX/C hackers, from the Mexican dance] In C, a wild
pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a {core dump}, or corrupts the
`malloc(3)' {arena} in such a way as to cause mysterious failures later on,
is sometimes said to have `done a fandango on core'. On low-end personal
machines without an MMU, this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive
lossage. Other frenetic dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha, or watusi, may be
substituted. see {aliasing bug}, {precedence lossage}, {smash the stack},
{memory leak}, {memory smash}, {overrun screw}, {core}.
