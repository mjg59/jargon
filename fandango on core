 :fandango on core: n. [Unix/C hackers, from the Iberian dance] In C, a wild
pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a {core dump}, or corrupts the
malloc(3) {arena} in such a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is
sometimes said to have `done a fandango on core'. On low-end personal
machines without an MMU (or Windows boxes, which have an MMU but use it
incompetently), this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive lossage.
Other frenetic dances, such as the cha-cha or the watusi, may be substituted.
