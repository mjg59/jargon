 :Amiga Persecution Complex: n. The disorder suffered by a particularly
egregious variety of {bigot}, those who believe that the marginality of their
preferred machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for
without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent superiority of their beloved
shining jewel of a platform would obviously win over all, market pressures be
damned!) Those afflicted are prone to engaging in {flame war}s and calling
for boycotts and mailbombings. Amiga Persecution Complex is by no means
limited to Amiga users; NeXT, {NeWS}, {OS/2}, Macintosh, {LISP}, and {GNU}
users are also common victims. {Linux} users used to display symptoms very
frequently before Linux started winning; some still do. see also {newbie},
{troll}, {holy wars}, {weenie}, {Get a life!}.
