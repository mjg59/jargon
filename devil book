 :Devil Book: n. `The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating
System', by Samuel J. Leffler, Marshall Kirk McKusick, Michael J. Karels, and
John S. Quarterman (Addison-Wesley Publishers, 1989, ISBN 0-201-06196-1) ---
the standard reference book on the internals of {BSD} UNIX. So called because
the cover has a picture depicting a little devil (a visual play on {daemon})
in sneakers, holding a pitchfork (referring to one of the characteristic
features of UNIX, the `fork(2)' system call).
