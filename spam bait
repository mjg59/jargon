 :spam bait: n.Email addresses included in, or comprising the entirety of, a
Usenet message so that spammers mining a newsgroup with an {address
harvester} will collect them. These addresses can be people who have offended
or annoyed the poster, or who are included so that a spammer will spam an
official, thereby causing himself trouble. One particularly effective form of
spam bait is the address of a {teergrube}.
