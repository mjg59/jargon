 :mouse pusher: [common] A person that prefers a mouse over a keyboard;
originally used for Macintosh fans. The derogatory implication is that the
person has nothing but the most superficial knowledge of the software he/she
is employing, and is incapable of using or appreciating the full glory of the
command line.
