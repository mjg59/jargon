 :spoiler space: [also spoiler spoo or spoiler protection] A screenful of
blank or spacer lines deliberately inserted in a message following a
{spoiler} warning, so the actual spoiler can't be seen without hitting a key.
Formfeeds used to be used for this, but are now rare because so many people
read news through Web interfaces on which they have no good interpretation.
