 :fork bomb: [UNIX] n. A particular species of {wabbit} that can be written
in one line of C (`main() {for(;;)fork();}') or shell (`$0 & $0 &') on any
UNIX system, or occasionally created by an egregious coding bug. A fork bomb
process `explodes' by recursively spawning copies of itself (using the UNIX
system call `fork(2)'). Eventually it eats all the process table entries and
effectively wedges the system. Fortunately, fork bombs are relatively easy to
spot and kill, so creating one deliberately seldom accomplishes more than to
bring the just wrath of the gods down upon the perpetrator. see also {logic
bomb}.
