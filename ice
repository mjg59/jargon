 :ice: /n./ [coined by Usenetter Tom Maddox, popularized by William Gibson's
cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for `Intrusion Countermeasure
Electronics'] Security software (in Gibson's novels, software that responds
to intrusion by attempting to immobilize or even literally kill the
intruder). Hence, `icebreaker': a program designed for cracking security on a
system. Neither term is in serious use yet as of early 1996, but many hackers
find the metaphor attractive, and each may develop a denotation in the
future. In the meantime, the speculative usage could be confused with `ICE',
an acronym for "in-c ircuit emulator". In ironic reference to the speculative
usage, however, some hackers and computer scientists formed ICE
(International Cryptographic Experiment) in 1994. ICE is a consortium to
promote uniform international access to strong cryptography. ICE has a home
