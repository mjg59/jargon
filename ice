 :ice: n. [coined by USENETter Tom Maddox, popularized by William Gibson's
cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for `Intrusion Countermeasure
Electronics'] Security software (in Gibson's novels, software that responds
to intrusion by attempting to literally kill the intruder). Also,
`icebreaker': a program designed for cracking security on a system. Neither
term is in serious use yet as of mid-1993, but many hackers find the metaphor
attractive, and each may develop a denotation in the future. In the meantime,
the speculative usage could be confused with `ICE', an acronym for
"in-circuit emulator".
