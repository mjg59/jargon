 ICE [from William Gibson's cyberpunk SF: notionally, "Intrusion
Countermeasure Electronics"] Security software. Also, ICEBREAKER: a program
designed for cracking security on a system. Neither term is in serious use
yet as of 1990, but many hackers find the metaphor attractive and they may be
in the near future.
