 EXE: /eks'ee/ or /eek'see/ or /E-X-E/ n. An executable binary file. Some
operating systems (notably MS-DOS, VMS, and TWENEX) use the extension .EXE to
mark such files. This usage is also occasionally found among UNIX programmers
even though UNIX executables don't have any required suffix. exec: /eg-zek'/
vt.,n. 1. [UNIX: from `execute'] Synonym for {chain}, derives from the
`exec(2)' call. 2. [from `executive'] obs. The command interpreter for an
{OS} (see {shell}); term esp. used around mainframes, and prob. derived from
UNIVAC's archaic EXEC 2 and EXEC 8 operating systems. 3. At IBM, the
equivalent of a shell command file (among VM/CMS users). The mainstream
`exec' as an abbreviation for (human) executive is *not* used. To a hacker,
an `exec' is a always a program, never a person. exercise, left as an: [from
technical books] Used to complete a proof when one doesn't mind a {handwave},
or to avoid one entirely. The complete phrase is: "The proof (or the rest) is
left as an exercise for the reader." This comment *has* occasionally been
attached to unsolved research problems by authors possessed of either an evil
sense of humor or a vast faith in the capabilities of their audiences.
eyeball search: n. To look for something in a mass of code or data with one's
own native optical sensors, as opposed to using some sort of pattern matching
software like {grep} or any other automated search tool. Also called a
{vgrep}; compare {vdiff}, {desk check}. = F = ===== fab: /fab/ [from
`fabricate'] v. 1. To produce chips from a design that may have been created
by someone at another company. Fabbing chips based on the designs of others
is the activity of a {silicon foundry}. To a hacker, `fab' is practically
never short for `fabulous'. 2. `fab line': the production system
(lithography, diffusion, etching, etc.) for chips at a chip manufacturer.
Different `fab lines' are run with different process parameters, die sizes,
or technologies, or simply to provide more manufacturing volume. face time:
n. Time spent interacting with somebody face-to-face (as opposed to via
electronic links). "Oh, yeah, I spent some face time with him at the last
Usenix." factor: n. see {coefficient}. fall over: [IBM] vi. Yet another
synonym for {crash} or {lose}. `Fall over hard' equates to {crash and burn}.
fall through: v. (n. `fallthrough', var. `fall-through') 1. To exit a loop by
exhaustion, i.e., by having fulfilled its exit condition rather than via a
break or exception condition that exits from the middle of it. This usage
appears to be *really* old, dating from the 1940s and 1950s. 2. To fail a
test that would have passed control to a subroutine or some other distant
portion of code. 3. In C, `fall-through' occurs when the flow of execution in
a switch statement reaches a `case' label other than by jumping there from
the switch header, passing a point where one would normally expect to find a
`break'. A trivial example: switch (color) { case GREEN: do_green(); break;
case PINK: do_pink(); /* FALL THROUGH */ case RED: do_red(); break; default:
do_blue(); break; } The variant spelling `/* FALL THRU */' is also common.
The effect of this code is to `do_green()' when color is `GREEN', `do_red()'
when color is `RED', `do_blue()' on any other color other than `PINK', and
(and this is the important part) `do_pink()' *and then* `do_red()' when color
is `PINK'. Fall-through is {considered harmful} by some, though there are
contexts (such as the coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is
generally considered good practice to include a comment highlighting the
fall-through where one would normally expect a break. fandango on core:
[UNIX/C hackers, from the Mexican dance] n. In C, a wild pointer that runs
out of bounds, causing a {core dump}, or corrupts the `malloc(3)' {arena} in
such a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is sometimes said to
have `done a fandango on core'. On low-end personal machines without an MMU,
this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive lossage. Other frenetic
dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha, or watusi, may be substituted. see
{aliasing bug}, {precedence lossage}, {smash the stack}, {memory leak},
{overrun screw}, {core}.
