 :hotlink: /hot'link/ /n./ A {hot spot} on a World Wide Web page; an area,
which, when clicked or selected, chases a URL. Also spelled `hot link'. Use
of this term focuses on the link's role in an immediate part of your display,
as opposed to the timeless sense of logical connection suggested by {web
pointer}. Your screen shows hotlinks and your document has web pointers, not
(in normal usage) the other way around.
