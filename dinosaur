 DINOSAUR (die'n@-sor) n. Any hardware requiring raised flooring and special
power. Used especially of old minis and mainframes when contrasted with newer
microprocessor-based machines. In a famous quote from the '88 UNIX EXPO, Bill
Joy compared the mainframe in the massive IBM display with a grazing
dinosaur, "with a truck outside pumping its bodily fluids through it". IBM
was not amused. Compare BIG IRON.
