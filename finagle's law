 :Finagle's Law: /n./ The generalized or `folk' version of {Murphy's Law},
fully named "Finagle's Law of Dynamic Negatives" and usually rendered
"Anything that can go wrong, will". One variant favored among hackers is "The
perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum" (but see also {Hanlon's
Razor}). The label `Finagle's Law' was popularized by SF author Larry Niven
in several stories depicting a frontier culture of asteroid miners; this
`Belter' culture professed a religion and/or running joke involving the
worship of the dread god Finagle and his mad prophet Murphy. Some technical
and scientific cultures (e.g., paleontologists) know it under the name `Sod's
Law'; this usage may be more common in Great Britain.
