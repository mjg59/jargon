 FReq: [FidoNet] written-only abbreviation for {File Request}. fried: adj. 1.
Non-working due to hardware failure; burnt out. Especially used of hardware
brought down by a `power glitch' (see {glitch}), {drop-outs}, a short, or
other electrical event. (Sometimes this literally happens to electronic
circuits! In particular, resistors can burn out and transformers can melt
down, emitting noxious smoke. However, this term is also used
metaphorically.) Compare {frotzed}. 2. Of people, exhausted. Said
particularly of those who continue to work in such a state. Often used as an
explanation or excuse. "Yeah, I know that fix destroyed the file system, but
I was fried when I put it in." fritterware: n. An excess of capability that
serves no productive end. The canonical example is font-diddling software on
the Mac (see {macdink}); the term describes anything that eats huge amounts
of time for quite marginal gains in function, but seduces people into using
it anyway. frob: /frob/ 1. n. [MIT] The official Tech Model Railroad Club
definition was `FROB = protruding arm or trunnion', and by metaphoric
extension any somewhat small thing; an object that you can comfortably hold
in one hand; something you can frob. see {frobnitz}. 2. vt. Abbreviated form
of {frobnicate}. 3. [from the {MUD} world] To request {wizard} privileges on
the `professional courtesy' grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere.
frobnicate: /frob'ni-kayt/ vt. [Poss. derived from {frobnitz}, and usually
abbreviated to {frob}, but `frobnicate' is recognized as the official full
form.] To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. One frequently frobs bits or other
two-state devices. Thus: "Please frob the light switch." (that is, flip it),
but also "Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it." One also sees the
construction `to frob a frob'. see {tweak} and {twiddle}. Usage: frob,
twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a continuum. `Frob'
connotes aimless manipulation; `twiddle' connotes gross manipulation, often a
coarse search for a proper setting; `tweak' connotes fine-tuning. If someone
is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he
is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen,
he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob
is fun, he's frobbing it. The variant `frobnosticate' has been recently
reported. frobnitz: /frob'nits/, pl. `frobnitzem' (frob'nit-zm) n. An
unspecified physical object, a widget. Also refers to electronic black boxes.
This rare form is usually abbreviated to `frotz', or more commonly to {frob}.
Also used are `frobnule' (/frob'n[y]ool/) and `frobule' (/frob'nool/).
Starting perhaps in 1979, `frobozz' /fruh-boz'/, plural `frobbotzim'
/fruh-bot'z@m/ has also become very popular, largely due to its exposure as a
name via {Zork}. These can also be applied to nonphysical objects, such as
data structures. frog: alt. `phrog' 1. interj. Term of disgust (we seem to
have a lot of them). 2. Used as a name for just about anything. see {foo}. 3.
n. Of things, a crock. 4. n. Of people, somewhere in between a turkey and a
toad. 5. `froggy': adj. Similar to `bagbiting' (see {bagbiter}), but milder.
"This froggy program is taking forever to run!" front end: n. 1. An
intermediary computer that does set-up and filtering for another (usually
more powerful but less friendly) machine (a `back end'). 2. What you're
talking to when you have a conversation with someone who is making replies
without paying attention. "Look at the dancing elephants!" "Uh-huh." "Do you
know what I just said?" "Sorry, you were talking to the front end." see also
{fepped out}. 3. Software which provides an interface to another program
`behind' it, which may not be as user-friendly. Probably from analogy with
hardware front-ends (see sense #1) which interfaced with mainframes. frotz:
/frotz/ 1. n. see {frobnitz}. 2. `mumble frotz': An interjection of very mild
disgust. frotzed: /frotzt/ adj. {down} due to hardware problems. Compare
{fried}. A machine which is merely frotzed may be fixable without replacing
parts, but a fried machine is more seriously damaged. fry: 1. vi. To fail.
Said especially of smoke-producing hardware failures. More generally, to
become non-working. Usage: never said of software, only of hardware and
humans. see {fried}, {magic smoke}. 2. vt. To cause to fail; to {roach},
{toast}, or {hose} a piece of hardware (never used of software or humans).
FTP: /ef-tee-pee/, *not* /fit'ip/ 1. [techspeak] n. The File Transfer
Protocol for transmitting files between systems on the Internet. 2. vt. To
{beam} a file using the File Transfer Protocol. 3. Sometimes used as a
generic even for file transfers not using {FTP}. "Lemme get this copy of
`Wuthering Heights' ftp'd from uunet." fuck me harder: excl. Sometimes
uttered in response to egregious misbehavior, esp. in software, and esp. of
those which seem unfairly persistent (as though designed in by the imp of the
perverse). Often theatrically elaborated: "Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver
and sixteen feet of curare-tipped wrought-iron fence *and no lubricants!*"
The phrase is sometimes heard abbreviated FMH in polite company.
