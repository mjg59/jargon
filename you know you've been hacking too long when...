 :You know you've been hacking too long when...: The set-up line for a genre
of one-liners told by hackers about themselves. These include the following:
* not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but you
remember your {network address} faster than your postal one. * your {SO}
kisses you on the neck and the first thing you think is "Uh, oh, {priority
interrupt}." * you go to balance your checkbook and discover that you're
doing it in octal. * your computers have a higher street value than your car.
* in your universe, `round numbers' are powers of 2, not 10. * more than
once, you have woken up recalling a dream in some programming language. * you
realize you have never seen half of your best friends. [An early version of
this entry said "All but one of these have been reliably reported as hacker
traits (some of them quite often). Even hackers may have trouble spotting the
ringer." The ringer was balancing one's checkbook in octal, which I made up
out of whole cloth. Although more respondents picked that one out as fiction
than any of the others, I also received multiple independent reports of its
actually happening, most famously to Grace Hopper while she was working with
BINAC in 1949. --- ESR]
