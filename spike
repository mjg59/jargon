 :spike: v. 1. To defeat a selection mechanism by introducing a (sometimes
temporary) device that forces a specific result. The word is used in several
industries; telephone engineers refer to spiking a relay by inserting a pin
to hold the relay in either the closed or open state, and railroaders refer
to spiking a track switch so that it cannot be moved. In programming
environments it normally refers to a temporary change, usually for testing
purposes (as opposed to a permanent change, which would be called
{hardwired}). 2. A visible peak in an otherwise rather constant graph (e.g. a
sudden surge in line voltage, an unexpected short "high" on a logical line in
a circuit). Hackers frequently use this for a sudden short increase in some
quantity such as system load or network traffic.
