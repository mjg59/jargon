 :ad-hockery: /ad·hok'@r·ee/, n. [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous assumptions made
inside certain programs, esp. expert systems, which lead to the appearance of
semi-intelligent behavior but are in fact entirely arbitrary. For example,
fuzzy-matching of input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol
table can make it look as though a program knows how to spell. 2.
Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would otherwise cause
a program to {choke}, presuming normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner
and more regular way. Also called ad-hackery, ad-hocity (/ad-hos'@-tee/),
ad-crockery. see also {ELIZA effect}. [73-10-31.png] This is {ad-hockery} in
action. (The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is 74-08-18. The previous one
