 :ad-hockery: /ad-hok'*r-ee/ [Purdue] n. 1. Gratuitous assumptions made
inside certain programs, esp. expert systems, which lead to the appearance of
semi-intelligent behavior but are in fact entirely arbitrary. For example,
fuzzy-matching against input tokens that might be typing errors against a
symbol table can make it look as though a program knows how to spell. 2.
Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would otherwise cause
a program to {choke}, presuming normal inputs are dealt with in some cleaner
and more regular way. Also called `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/),
`ad-crockery'. see also {ELIZA effect}.
