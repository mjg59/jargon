 LION FOOD [IBM] n. Middle management or HQ staff (by extension,
administrative drones in general). From an old joke about two lions who,
escaping from the zoo, split up to increase their chances but agreed to meet
after two months. When they do meet, one is skinny and the other overweight.
The thin one says "How did you manage? I ate a human just once and they
turned out a small army to chase me -- guns, nets, it was terrible. Since
then I've been reduced to eating mice, insects, even grass." The fat one
replies "Well, *I* hid near an IBM office and ate a manager a day. And nobody
even noticed!"
