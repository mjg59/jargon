 :lion food: [IBM] n. Middle management or HQ staff (or, by extension,
administrative drones in general). From an old joke about two lions who,
escaping from the zoo, split up to increase their chances but agree to meet
after 2 months. When they finally meet, one is skinny and the other
overweight. The thin one says: "How did you manage? I ate a human just once
and they turned out a small army to chase me --- guns, nets, it was terrible.
Since then I've been reduced to eating mice, insects, even grass." The fat
one replies: "Well, *I* hid near an IBM office and ate a manager a day. And
nobody even noticed!"
