 :gribble: n. Random binary data rendered as unreadable text. Noise
characters in a data stream are displayed as gribble. Modems with mismatched
bitrates usually generate gribble (more specifically, {baud barf}). Dumping a
binary file to the screen is an excellent source of gribble, and (if the
bell/speaker is active) headaches.
