 FEATURECTOMY /fee`ch@r-ek'to-mee/ n. The act of removing a feature from a
program. Featurectomies generally come in two varieties, the RIGHTEOUS and
the RELUCTANT. Righteous featurectomies are performed because the remover
believes the program would be more elegant without the feature, or there is
already an equivalent and "better" way to achieve the same end. (This is not
quite the same thing as removing a MISFEATURE.) Reluctant featurectomies are
performed to satisfy some external constraint such as code size or execution
speed.
