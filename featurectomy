 :featurectomy: /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ n. The act of removing a feature from a
program. Featurectomies come in two flavors, the `righteous' and the
`reluctant'. Righteous featurectomies are performed because the remover
believes the program would be more elegant without the feature, or there is
already an equivalent and better way to achieve the same end. (Doing so is
not quite the same thing as removing a {misfeature}.) Reluctant
featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint such as code
size or execution speed.
