 ERIC CONSPIRACY n. Notional group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first
pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous talk.bizarre posting c.
1986; this was doubtless influenced by the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty
Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed
hacker-Erics than the frequency of these three traits can account for unless
they are correlated in some arcane way. Well known examples include Eric
Allman of BSD fame, Erik Fair (coauthor of NNTP) and your editor [ESR]; your
editor has heard from about fourteen others by email.
