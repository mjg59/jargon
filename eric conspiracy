 :Eric Conspiracy: n. A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first
pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous talk.bizarre posting ca.
1987; this was doubtless influenced by the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty
Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed Erics
in hackerdom than the frequency of these three traits can account for unless
they are correlated in some arcane way. Well-known examples include Eric
Allman (he of the `Allman style' described under {indent style}) and Erik
Fair (co-author of NNTP); your editor has heard from more than a hundred
others by email, and the organization line `Eric Conspiracy Secret
Laboratories' now emanates regularly from more than one site. see the Eric
Conspiracy Web Page at `http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/ecsl/' for full details.
