 ERIC CONSPIRACY n. Notional group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first
pinpointed as a sinister conspiracy by an infamous talk.bizarre posting c.
1986; this was doubtless influenced by the numerous `Eric' jokes in the Monty
Python oeuvre. There do indeed seem to be considerably more mustachioed
hacker-Erics than the frequency of these three traits can account for unless
they are correlated in some arcane way. Well known examples include your
editor [ESR], Eric Allman of BSD fame, and Erik Fair (coauthor of NNTP); your
editor has heard from about fourteen others by email.
