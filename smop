 SMOP: /smop/ [Simple (or Small) Matter of Programming] n. 1. A piece of
code, not yet written, whose anticipated length is significantly greater than
its complexity. Usage: used to refer to a program that could obviously be
written, but is not worth the trouble. It is also used ironically to imply
that a difficult problem can be easily solved because a program can be
written to do it; the irony is that it is very clear that writing such a
program will be a great deal of work. Example: "It's easy to enhance a
FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as well; it's just a SMOP." 2. Often used
ironically by the intended victim when a suggestion for a program is made
which seems easy to the suggester, but is obviously (to the victim) a lot of
work.
