 :SMOP: /S-M-O-P/ n. [Simple (or Small) Matter of Programming] 1. A piece of
code, not yet written, whose anticipated length is significantly greater than
its complexity. Used to refer to a program that could obviously be written,
but is not worth the trouble. Also used ironically to imply that a difficult
problem can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it; the
irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be a great
deal of work. "It's easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to compile COBOL as
well; it's just an SMOP." 2. Often used ironically by the intended victim
when a suggestion for a program is made which seems easy to the suggester,
but is obviously (to the victim) a lot of work. Compare {minor detail}.
