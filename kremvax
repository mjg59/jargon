 KREMVAX /krem-vaks/ [From the then large number of USENET VAXEN with names
of the form "foovax"] n. A fictitious USENET site at the Kremlin, announced
on April 1, 1984, in a posting ostensibly from Soviet leader Konstantin
Chernenko. The posting was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April
Fool's joke. Other sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and KGBVAX, which
now seems to be the one by which it is remembered. This was probably the
funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries perpetrated on USENET (which has
negligible security against them), because the notion that USENET might ever
penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time. But in fact,
the first genuine site in Moscow (demos.su) joined USENET only 6 years later
--- and some readers needed convincing that it wasn't a hoax. [Ed. note:
Vadim Antonov (avg), the major poster from demos.su up to at least the end of
1990, was well acquainted with the kremvax hoax and referred to it in his own
postings --- even to the extent of twitting a number of credulous netters on
alt.folklore.computers by blandly "admitting" that *he* was a hoax! Mr.
Antonov, BTW, also contributed the Russian-language material for this File
