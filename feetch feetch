 :feetch feetch: /feech feech/ /interj./ If someone tells you about some new
improvement to a program, you might respond: "Feetch, feetch!" The meaning of
this depends critically on vocal inflection. With enthusiasm, it means
something like "Boy, that's great! What a great hack!" Grudgingly or with
obvious doubt, it means "I don't know; it sounds like just one more
unnecessary and complicated thing". With a tone of resignation, it means,
"Well, I'd rather keep it simple, but I suppose it has to be done".
