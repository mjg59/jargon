 :sitename: /si:t'naym/ /n./ [Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a
computer system, used to identify it in UUCP mail, Usenet, or other forms of
electronic information interchange. The folklore interest of sitenames stems
from the creativity and humor they often display. Interpreting a sitename is
not unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack
it, allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of
whitespace. Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding names in
favor of punchy, humorous, and clever coinages (except that it is considered
appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an organization to
bear the organization's name or acronym). Mythological references, cartoon
characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature are
probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly descending
order). The obligatory comment when discussing these is Harris's Lament: "All
the good ones are taken!" see also {network address}.
