 SITENAME [UNIX/Internet] n. The unique electronic name of a computer system,
used to identify it in UUCP mail, USENET or other forms of electronic
information interchange. The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the
creativity and humor they often display. Interpreting a sitename is not
unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of whitespace.
Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding names in favor of
punchy, humorous and clever coinages (except that it is considered
appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an organization to
bear the organization's name or acronym). Mythological references, cartoon
characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature are
probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly that order). see
also NETWORK ADDRESS.
