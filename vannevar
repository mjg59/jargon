 VANNEVAR (van'@-var) n. A bogus technological prediction or foredoomed
engineering concept, esp. one which fails by implicitly assuming that
technologies develop linearly, incrementally, and in isolation from one
another when in fact the learning curve tends to be highly nonlinear,
revolutions are common, and competition is the rule. The prototype was
Vannevar Bush's prediction of "electronic brains" the size of the Empire
State Building with a Niagara-Falls-equivalent cooling system for their tubes
and relays, at a time when the semiconductor effect had already been
demonstrated. Other famous vannevars have included commercial LISP machines
and a paper from the late 1970s that purported to prove maximum achievable
areal densities for ICs less than those routinely achieved five years later.
