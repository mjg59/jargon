 :vannevar: /van'*-var/ n. A bogus technological prediction or a foredoomed
engineering concept, esp. one that fails by implicitly assuming that
technologies develop linearly, incrementally, and in isolation from one
another when in fact the learning curve tends to be highly nonlinear,
revolutions are common, and competition is the rule. The prototype was
Vannevar Bush's prediction of `electronic brains' the size of the Empire
State Building with a Niagara-Falls-equivalent cooling system for their tubes
and relays, a prediction made at a time when the semiconductor effect had
already been demonstrated. Other famous vannevars have included
magnetic-bubble memory, LISP machines, {videotex}, and a paper from the late
1970s that computed a purported ultimate limit on areal density for ICs that
was in fact less than the routine densities of 5 years later.
