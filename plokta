 :plokta: /plok't*/ [Acronym for `Press Lots Of Keys To Abort'] v. To press
random keys in an attempt to get some response from the system. One might
plokta when the abort procedure for a program is not known, or when trying to
figure out if the system is just sluggish or really hung. Plokta can also be
used while trying to figure out any unknown key sequence for a particular
operation. Someone going into `plokta mode' usually places both hands flat on
the keyboard and presses down, hoping for some useful response. A slightly
more diected form of plokta can often be seen in mail messages or USENET
articles from new users -- the text might end with q quit :q ^C end x exit ZZ
^D ? help as the user vainly tries to find the right exit sequence, with the
incorrect tries piling up at the end of the message....
