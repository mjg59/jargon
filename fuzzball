 :fuzzball: n. [TCP/IP hackers] A DEC LSI-11 running a particular suite of
homebrewed software written by Dave Mills and assorted co-conspirators, used
in the early 1980s for Internet protocol testbedding and experimentation.
These were used as NSFnet backbone sites in its early 56KB-line days; a few
are still active on the Internet as of mid 1993, doing odd jobs such as
network time service. = G = =====
