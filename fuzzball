 FUZZBALL [TCP/IP hackers] n. A DEC LSI-11 running a particular suite of
homebrewed software by Dave Mills and assorted co-conspirators, used in the
early 80's for Internet protocol testbedding and experimentation. These were
used as NSFnet backbone sites in its early 56KB-line days; a few of these are
still active on the Internet as of early 1990, doing odd jobs such as network
time service. = G =
