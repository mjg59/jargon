 :dump: n. 1. An undigested and voluminous mass of information about a
problem or the state of a system, especially one routed to the slowest
available output device (compare {core dump}), and most especially one
consisting of hex or octal {runes} describing the byte-by-byte state of
memory, mass storage, or some file. In {elder days}, debugging was generally
done by `groveling over' a dump (see {grovel}); increasing use of high-level
languages and interactive debuggers has made such tedium uncommon, and the
term `dump' now has a faintly archaic flavor. 2. A backup. This usage is
typical only at large timesharing installations.
