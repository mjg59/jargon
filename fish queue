 :FISH queue: n. [acronym, by analogy with FIFO (First In, First Out)] `First
In, Still Here'. A joking way of pointing out that processing of a particular
sequence of events or requests has stopped dead. Also FISH mode and FISHnet;
the latter may be applied to any network that is running really slowly or
exhibiting extreme flakiness.
