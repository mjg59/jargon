 SPOOL v. To send files to some device or program (a `spooler') that queues
them up and does something useful with them later. The spooler usually
understood is the `print spooler' controlling output of jobs to a printer,
but the term has been used in connection with other peripherals (especially
plotters and graphics devices).
