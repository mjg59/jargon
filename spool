 :spool: [from early IBM `Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line', but
this acronym is widely thought to have been contrived for effect] vt. To send
files to some device or program (a `spooler') that queues them up and does
something useful with them later. The spooler usually understood is the
`print spooler' controlling output of jobs to a printer, but the term has
been used in connection with other peripherals (especially plotters and
graphics devices) and occasionally even for input devices. see also {demon}.
