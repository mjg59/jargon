 :spool: vi. [from early IBM `Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line', but
is widely thought to be a {backronym}] To send files to some device or
program (a `spooler') that queues them up and does something useful with them
later. Without qualification, the spooler is the `print spooler' controlling
output of jobs to a printer; but the term has been used in connection with
other peripherals (especially plotters and graphics devices) and occasionally
even for input devices. see also {demon}.
