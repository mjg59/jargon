 BIGNUMS [from Macsyma] n. 1. In backgammon, large numbers on the dice. 2.
Multiple-precision (sometimes infinitely extendable) integers and, through
analogy, any very large numbers. 3. EL CAMINO BIGNUM: El Camino Real, a
street through the San Francisco peninsula that origi- nally extended (and
still appears in places) all the way to Mexico City. It was termed "El Camino
Double Preci- sion" when someone noted it was a very long street, and then
"El Camino Bignum" when it was pointed out that it was hundreds of miles
long.
