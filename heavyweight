 :heavyweight: adj. High-overhead; {baroque}; code-intensive; featureful, but
costly. Esp. used of communication protocols, language designs, and any sort
of implementation in which maximum generality and/or ease of implementation
has been pushed at the expense of mundane considerations such as speed,
memory utilization, and startup time. {EMACS} is a heavyweight editor; {X} is
an *extremely* heavyweight window system. This term isn't pejorative, but one
man's heavyweight is another's {elephantine} and a third's {monstrosity}.
Oppose `lightweight'. Usage: now borders on techspeak, especially in the
compound `heavyweight process'.
