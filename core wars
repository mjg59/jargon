 :Core Wars: n. A game between `assembler' programs in a machine or machine
simulator, where the objective is to kill your opponent's program by
overwriting it. Popularized in the 1980s by A. K. Dewdney's column in
"Scientific American" magazine, but described in "Software Practice And
Experience" a decade earlier. The game was actually devised and played by
Victor Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and Doug McIlroy in the early 1960s
(Dennis Ritchie is sometimes incorrectly cited as a co-author, but was not
involved). Their original game was called `Darwin' and ran on a IBM 7090 at
Bell Labs. see {core}. For information on the modern game, do a web search
