 :freeze: v. To lock an evolving software distribution or document against
changes so it can be released with some hope of stability. Carries the strong
implication that the item in question will `unfreeze' at some future date.
"OK, fix that bug and we'll freeze for release." There are more specific
constructions on this. A `feature freeze', for example, locks out
modifications intended to introduce new features; a `code freeze' connotes no
more changes at all. At Sun Microsystems and elsewhere, one may also hear
references to `code slush' --- that is, an almost-but-not-quite frozen state.
