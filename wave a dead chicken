 :wave a dead chicken: v. To perform a ritual in the direction of crashed
software or hardware that one believes to be futile but is nevertheless
necessary so that others are satisfied that an appropriate degree of effort
has been expended. "I'll wave a dead chicken over the source code, but I
really think we've run into an OS bug." Compare {voodoo programming}, {rain
dance}.
