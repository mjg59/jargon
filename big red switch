 :Big Red Switch: n. [IBM] The power switch on a computer, esp. the
`Emergency Pull' switch on an IBM {mainframe} or the power switch on an IBM
PC where it really is large and red. "This !@%$% {bitty box} is hung again;
time to hit the Big Red Switch." Sources at IBM report that, in tune with the
company's passion for {TLA}s, this is often abbreviated as `BRS' (this has
also become established on FidoNet and in the PC {clone} world). It is
alleged that the emergency pull switch on an IBM 360/91 actually fired a
non-conducting bolt into the main power feed; the BRSes on more recent
mainframes physically drop a block into place so that they can't be pushed
back in. People get fired for pulling them, especially inappropriately (see
also {molly-guard}). Compare {power cycle}, {three-finger salute}; see also
{scram switch}.
