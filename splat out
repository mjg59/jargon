 :splat out: v. [Usenet; syn. `disemvowel'] To partially obscure a
potentially provocative word by substituting {splat} characters for some of
its letters (usually, but not always, the vowels). The purpose is not to make
the word unrecognizable but to make it a mention rather than a use, so that
no flamewar ensues. Words often splatted out include N*z* (see {Godwin's
Law}), k*bo* (see {KIBO, sense 2}), *v*l*t**n (anywhere fundamentalists might
be lurking), *b*rt**n, and g*n c*ntr*l. Compare {UN*X}.
