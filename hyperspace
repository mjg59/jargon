 :hyperspace: /hi:'per-spays/ n. A memory location that is *far* away from
where the program counter should be pointing, often inaccessible because it
is not even mapped in. "Another core dump --- looks like the program jumped
off to hyperspace somehow." (Compare {jump off into never-never land}.) This
usage is from the SF notion of a spaceship jumping `into hyperspace', that
is, taking a shortcut through higher-dimensional space --- in other words,
bypassing this universe. The variant `east hyperspace' is recorded among CMU
and Bliss hackers. = I = =====
