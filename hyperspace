 HYPERSPACE (hie'per-spays) n. A memory location within a virtual memory
machine that is many, many megabytes (or gigabytes) away from where the
program counter should be pointing, usually inaccessible because it is not
even mapped in. "Another core dump... looks like the program jumped off to
hyperspace somehow." {= I =}
