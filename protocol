 :protocol: n. As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the
proper form for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which
one should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care
about such things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules that allow
different machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each other
without ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties about the proper
form for addressing packets on a network or the order in which one should use
the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It implies that there is some
common message format and an accepted set of primitives or commands that all
parties involved understand, and that transactions among them follow
predictable logical sequences. see also {handshaking}, {do protocol}.
