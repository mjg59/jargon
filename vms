 VMS (vee em ess) n. DEC's proprietary operating system for their VAX
minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that looms largest in
hacker folklore. Many UNIX fans generously concede that VMS would probably be
the hacker's favorite commercial OS if UNIX didn't exist; though true, this
makes VMS fans furious. see also TOPS-10, TOPS-20, UNIX.
