 VMS: /V-M-S/ n. DEC's proprietary operating system for its VAX minicomputer;
one of the seven or so environments that loom largest in hacker folklore.
Many UNIX fans generously concede that VMS would probably be the hacker's
favorite commercial OS if UNIX didn't exist; though true, this makes VMS fans
furious. One major hacker gripe with VMS concerns its slowness --- thus the
following limerick: There once was a system called VMS Of cycles by no means
abstemious. It's chock-full of hacks And runs on a VAX And makes my poor
stomach all squeamious. --- The Great Quux see also {VAX}, {{TOPS-10}},
{{TOPS-20}}, {{UNIX}}, {runic}. voice: vt. To phone someone, as opposed to
emailing them or connecting in talk mode. "I'm busy now; I'll voice you
later." voice-net: n. Hackish way of referring to the telephone system,
analogizing it to a digital network. USENET {sig block}s not uncommonly
include the sender's phone next to a "Voice:" or "Voice-Net:" header; common
variants of this are "Voicenet" and "V-Net". Compare {paper-net},
{snail-mail}. voodoo programming: [from George Bush's "voodoo economics"] n.
The use by guess or cookbook of an {obscure} or {hairy} system, feature, or
algorithm that one does not truly understand. The implication is that the
technique may not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why. Almost
synonymous with {black magic}, except that black magic typically isn't
documented and *nobody* understands it. Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy
wizardry}, {rain dance}, {cargo cult programming}, {wave a dead chicken}.
