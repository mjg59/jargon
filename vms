 VMS: /vee em ess/ n. DEC's proprietary operating system for their VAX
minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that loom largest in hacker
folklore. Many UNIX fans generously concede that VMS would probably be the
hacker's favorite commercial OS if UNIX didn't exist; though true, this makes
VMS fans furious. One major hacker gripe with it is its slowness, thus the
following limerick: There once was a system called VMS Of cycles by no means
abstemious. It's chock-full of hacks And runs on a VAX And makes my poor
stomach all squeamious. ---The Great Quux see also {VAX}, {TOPS-10},
{TOPS-20}, {UNIX}, {runic}. voice-net: n. Hackish way of referring to the
telephone system, analogizing it to a digital network. USENET {sig block}s
not uncommonly include the sender's phone next to a "Voice:" or "Voice-Net:"
header; common variants of this are "Voicenet" and "V-Net". Compare
{paper-net}, {snail-mail}. voodoo programming: [from George Bush's "voodoo
economics"] n. The use by guess or cookbook of an {obscure}, {hairy} system
feature or algorithm that one does not truly understand. The implication is
that the technique may not work, and if it doesn't, one will never know why.
Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy wizardry}, {rain dance}, {cargo-cult
programming}, {wave a dead chicken}. vulcan nerve pinch: n. [From the old
Star Trek TV series via Commodore Amiga hackers] The keyboard combination
that forces a soft-boot or jump to ROM monitor (on machines that support such
a feature). On many micros this is Ctrl-Alt-Del; on Suns, L1-A; on
Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch>! Also called {three-finger salute}.
Compare {quadruple bucky}. vulture capitalist: n. Pejorative hackerism for
`venture capitalist', deriving from the common practice of pushing contracts
that deprive inventors of both control over their own innovations and most of
the money they ought to have made from them. = W = ===== wabbit: /wab'it/
[almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line "you wascawwy wabbit!"] n.
1. A legendary early hack reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere
around 1978. The program would reproduce itself twice every time it was run,
eventually crashing the system. 2. By extension, any hack that includes
infinite self-replication but is not a {virus} or {worm}. see also {cookie
monster}.
