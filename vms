 :VMS: /V-M-S/ /n./ DEC's proprietary operating system for its VAX
minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that loom largest in hacker
folklore. Many Unix fans generously concede that VMS would probably be the
hacker's favorite commercial OS if Unix didn't exist; though true, this makes
VMS fans furious. One major hacker gripe with VMS concerns its slowness --
thus the following limerick: There once was a system called VMS Of cycles by
no means abstemious. It's chock-full of hacks And runs on a VAX And makes my
poor stomach all squeamious. -- The Great Quux see also {VAX}, {{TOPS-10}},
