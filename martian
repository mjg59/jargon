 :martian: /n./ A packet sent on a TCP/IP network with a source address of
the test loopback interface [127.0.0.1]. This means that it will come back
labeled with a source address that is clearly not of this earth. "The domain
server is getting lots of packets from Mars. Does that gateway have a martian
filter?"
