 :restriction: n. A {bug} or design error that limits a program's
capabilities, and which is sufficiently egregious that nobody can quite work
up enough nerve to describe it as a {feature}. Often used (esp. by
{marketroid} types) to make it sound as though some crippling bogosity had
been intended by the designers all along, or was forced upon them by arcane
technical constraints of a nature no mere user could possibly comprehend
(these claims are almost invariably false). Old-time hacker Joseph M.
Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a quantifiable but arbitrary
restriction, you should make it either a power of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1.
If you impose a limit of 17 items in a list, everyone will know it is a
random number --- on the other hand, a limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep
reason (involving 0- or 1-based indexing in binary) and you will get less
{flamage} for it. Limits which are round numbers in base 10 are always
especially suspect.
