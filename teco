 TECO (tee'koe) [acronym for Text Editor and COrrector] 1. n. A text editor
developed at MIT, and modified by just about everybody. If all the dialects
are included, TECO might well be the single most prolific editor in use.
Noted for its powerful pseudo-programming features and its incredibly hairy
syntax. 2. v. To edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite forms;
sometimes used to mean "to edit" even when not using TECO! Usage: rare at
SAIL, where most people wouldn't touch TECO with a TENEX pole. [Historical
note: DEC grabbed an ancient version of MIT TECO many years ago when it was
still a TTY-oriented editor. By now, TECO at MIT is highly display-oriented
and is actually a language for writing editors, rather than an editor.
Meanwhile, the outside world's various versions of TECO remain almost the
same as the MIT version of ten years ago. DEC recently tried to discourage
its use, but an underground movement of sorts kept it alive.] [Since this
note was written I found out that DEC tried to force their hackers by
administrative decision to use a hacked up and generally lobotomized version
of SOS instead of TECO, and they revolted. --MRC]
