 CU l8er see you later (mutant of `CU l8tr') FOAD fuck off and die (use of
this is generally OTT) OTT over the top (excessive, uncalled for) ppl abbrev
for "people" THX thanks (mutant of `TNX'; clearly this comes in batches of
1138 (the Lucasian K)). UOK? are you OK? Some {B1FF}isms (notably the variant
spelling `d00d') appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
MUDders. One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are
typing rather than speaking. This is not the best approach. It can be very
frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or
repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it. It is
usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward,
unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to
type "xxx" and start over from before the mistake. see also {hakspek},
{emoticon}. :talker system: n. British hackerism for software that enables
real-time chat or {talk mode}. :tall card: n. A PC/AT-size expansion card
(these can be larger than IBM PC or XT cards because the AT case is bigger).
see also {short card}. When IBM introduced the PS/2 model 30 (its last gasp
at supporting the ISA) they made the case lower and many industry-standard
tall cards wouldn't fit; this was felt to be a reincarnation of the
{connector conspiracy}, done with less style. :tanked: adj. Same as {down},
used primarily by Unix hackers. see also {hosed}. Popularized as a synonym
for `drunk' by Steve Dallas in the late lamented "Bloom County" comic strip.
:TANSTAAFL: /tan'stah-fl/ [acronym, from Robert Heinlein's classic "The Moon
is a Harsh Mistress".] "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch", often
invoked when someone is balking at the prospect of using an unpleasantly
{heavyweight} technique, or at the poor quality of some piece of software, or
at the {signal-to-noise ratio} of unmoderated Usenet newsgroups. "What? Don't
tell me I have to implement a database back end to get my address book
program to work!" "Well, TANSTAAFL you know." This phrase owes some of its
popularity to the high concentration of science-fiction fans and political
libertarians in hackerdom (see {A Portrait of J. Random Hacker} in Appendix
B). :tape monkey: n. A junior system administrator, one who might plausibly
be assigned to do physical swapping of tapes and subsequent storage. When a
backup needs to be restored, one might holler "Tape monkey!" (Compare
{one-banana problem}) Also used to dismiss jobs not worthy of a highly
trained sysadmin's ineffable talents: "Cable up her PC? You must be joking -
I'm no tape monkey." :tar and feather: vi. [from Unix `tar(1)'] To create a
transportable archive from a group of files by first sticking them together
with `tar(1)' (the Tape ARchiver) and then compressing the result (see
{compress}). The latter action is dubbed `feathering' partly for euphony and
(if only for contrived effect) by analogy to what you do with an airplane
propeller to decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to reduce water
resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm links more easily.
:tarball: n. [prob. based on the "tar baby" in the Uncle Remus folk tales] An
archive, created with the Unix tar(1) utility, containing myriad related
files. "Here, I'll just ftp you a tarball of the whole project." Tarballs
have been the standard way to ship around source-code distributions since the
mid-1980s; in retrospect it seems odd that this term did not enter common
usage until the late 1990s. :taste: [primarily MIT] n. 1. The quality in a
program that tends to be inversely proportional to the number of features,
hacks, and kluges programmed into it. Also `tasty', `tasteful',
`tastefulness'. "This feature comes in N tasty flavors." Although `tasty' and
`flavorful' are essentially synonyms, `taste' and {flavor} are not. Taste
refers to sound judgment on the part of the creator; a program or feature can
_exhibit_ taste but cannot _have_ taste. On the other hand, a feature can
have {flavor}. Also, {flavor} has the additional meaning of `kind' or
`variety' not shared by `taste'. The marked sense of {flavor} is more popular
than `taste', though both are widely used. see also {elegant}. 2. Alt. sp. of
{tayste}. :tayste: /tayst/ n. Two bits; also as {taste}. Syn. {crumb},
{quarter}. see {nybble}. :TCB: /T-C-B/ n. [IBM] 1. Trouble Came Back. An
intermittent or difficult-to-reproduce problem that has failed to respond to
neglect or {shotgun debugging}. Compare {heisenbug}. Not to be confused with:
2. Trusted Computing Base, an `official' jargon term from the {Orange Book}.
:TCP/IP: /T'C-P I'P/ n. 1. [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol]
The wide-area-networking protocol that makes the Internet work, and the only
one most hackers can speak the name of without laughing or retching. Unlike
such allegedly `standard' competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO
7-layer stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being _used_, rather than
being handed down from on high by a vendor or a heavily-politicized standards
committee. Consequently, it (a) works, (b) actually promotes cheap
cross-platform connectivity, and (c) annoys the hell out of corporate and
governmental empire-builders everywhere. Hackers value all three of these
properties. see {creationism}. 2. [Amateur Packet Radio] Sometimes expanded
as "The Crap Phil Is Pushing". The reference is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the
context is an ongoing technical/political war between the majority of sites
still running AX.25 and a growing minority of TCP/IP relays. :TechRef:
/tek'ref/ n. [MS-DOS] The original "IBM PC Technical Reference Manual",
including the BIOS listing and complete schematics for the PC. The only PC
documentation in the original-issue package that was considered serious by
real hackers. :TECO: /tee'koh/ n.,v. obs. 1. [originally an acronym for
`[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector'; later, `Text Editor and COrrector'] n. A
text editor developed at MIT and modified by just about everybody. With all
the dialects included, TECO may have been the most prolific editor in use
before {EMACS}, to which it was directly ancestral. Noted for its powerful
programming-language-like features and its unspeakably hairy syntax. It is
literally the case that every string of characters is a valid TECO program
(though probably not a useful one); one common game used to be mentally
working out what the TECO commands corresponding to human names did. 2. vt.
Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite variations
(see below). 3. vt.,obs. To edit even when TECO is _not_ the editor being
used! This usage is rare and now primarily historical. As an example of
TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes a list of names such as:
Loser, J. Random Quux, The Great Dick, Moby sorts them alphabetically
according to surname, and then puts the surname last, removing the comma, to
produce the following: Moby Dick J. Random Loser The Great Quux The program
is [1 J^P$L$$ J <.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L>$$ (where ^B means
`Control-B' (ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually an {alt} or escape (ASCII
0011011) character). In fact, this very program was used to produce the
second, sorted list from the first list. The first hack at it had a {bug}:
GLS (the author) had accidentally omitted the `@' in front of `F^B', which as
anyone can see is clearly the {Wrong Thing}. It worked fine the second time.
There is no space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may be of
interest that `^P' means `sort' and `J<.-Z; ... L>' is an idiomatic series of
commands for `do once for every line'. In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one
with the dust of history, having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom
by {EMACS}. Descendants of an early (and somewhat lobotomized) version
adopted by DEC can still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty
