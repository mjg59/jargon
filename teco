 TECO: /tee'koh/ obs. 1. vt. Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in one
of its infinite variations (see below); sometimes still used to mean `to
edit' even when not using TECO! Usage: rare and now primarily historical. 2.
[originally an acronym for `(paper) Tape Editor and COrrector'; later, `Text
Editor and Corrector'] n. A text editor developed at MIT and modified by just
about everybody. If all the dialects are included, TECO might have been the
single most prolific editor in use before {EMACS}, to which it was directly
ancestral. Noted for its powerful programming-language-like features and its
incredibly hairy syntax. It is literally the case that every possible
sequence of {{ASCII}} characters is a valid, though probably uninteresting,
TECO program; one common hacker game used to be mentally working out what the
TECO commands corresponding to human names did. As an example, here is a TECO
program that takes a list of names like this: Loser, J. Random Quux, The
Great Dick, Moby sorts them alphabetically according to last name, and then
puts the last name last, removing the comma, to produce this: Moby Dick J.
Random Loser The Great Quux The program is: [1 J^P$L$$ J <.-Z; .,(S,$ -D
.)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L>$$ (where ^B means `Control-B' (ASCII #b0000010)
and $ is actually an {ALT} or escape (ASCII #b0011011) character). In fact,
this very program was used to produce the second, sorted list from the first
list! The first hack at it had a {bug}: GLS (the author) had accidentally
omitted the `@' in front of `F^B', which as anyone can see is clearly the
{Wrong Thing}. It worked fine the second time. There is no space to describe
all the features of TECO, but it may be of interest that `^P' means `sort'
and `J<.-Z; ... L>' is an idiomatic series of commands for `do once for every
line'. In mid-1991, TECO is now pretty much one with the dust of history,
having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by {EMACS}. It can still
be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty PDP-11 operating systems,
however, and remains the focus of some antiquarian interest. see also
{write-only language}. tee: n.,vt. [Purdue] A carbon copy of an electronic
transmission. "Oh, you're sending him the {bits} to that? Slap on a tee for
me." From the UNIX command `tee(1)', itself named after a pipe fitting (see
{plumbing}, {pipeline}). Can also mean `save one for me' as in "Tee a slice
for me!". Also spelled `T'. Telerat: /tel'@-rat/ n. Unflattering hackerism
for `Teleray', a line of extremely losing terminals. see also {terminak},
{sun-stools}, {HP-SUX}.
