 TECO (tee'koh) [acronym for Text Editor and COrrector] 1. n. A text editor
developed at MIT, and modified by just about everybody. If all the dialects
are included, TECO might well be the single most prolific editor in use.
Noted for its powerful pseudo-programming features and its incredibly hairy
syntax. 2. v. obs. To edit using the TECO editor in one of its infinite
forms; sometimes used to mean "to edit" even when not using TECO! Usage: rare
at SAIL, where most people wouldn't touch TECO with a TENEX pole. [Historical
note, c. 1982: DEC grabbed an ancient version of MIT TECO many years ago when
it was still a TTY-oriented editor. By now, TECO at MIT is highly
display-oriented and is actually a language for writing editors, rather than
an editor. Meanwhile, the outside world's various versions of TECO remain
almost the same as the MIT version of the early 1970s. DEC recently tried to
discourage its use, but an underground movement of sorts kept it alive. --
GLS] [Since this note was written I found out that DEC tried to force their
hackers by administrative decision to use a hacked up and generally
lobotomized version of SOS instead of TECO, and they revolted. -- MRC] [1990
update: TECO is now pretty much one with the dust of history, having been
replaced (both functionally and psychologically) almost everywhere by GNU
EMACS -- ESR]
