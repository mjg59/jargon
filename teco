 :TECO: /tee'koh/ obs. 1. vt. Originally, to edit using the TECO editor in
one of its infinite variations (see below). 2. vt.,obs. To edit even when
TECO is *not* the editor being used! This usage is rare and now primarily
historical. 2. [originally an acronym for `[paper] Tape Editor and
COrrector'; later, `Text Editor and COrrector'] n. A text editor developed at
MIT and modified by just about everybody. With all the dialects included,
TECO might have been the most prolific editor in use before {EMACS}, to which
it was directly ancestral. Noted for its powerful programming-language-like
features and its unspeakably hairy syntax. It is literally the case that
every string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not a
useful one); one common hacker game used to be mentally working out what the
TECO commands corresponding to human names did. As an example of TECO's
obscurity, here is a TECO program that takes a list of names such as: Loser,
J. Random Quux, The Great Dick, Moby sorts them alphabetically according to
surname, and then puts the surname last, removing the comma, to produce the
following: Moby Dick J. Random Loser The Great Quux The program is [1 J^P$L$$
J <.-Z; .,(S,$ -D .)FX1 @F^B $K :L I $ G1 L>$$ (where ^B means `Control-B'
(ASCII 0000010) and $ is actually an {alt} or escape (ASCII 0011011)
character). In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted
list from the first list. The first hack at it had a {bug}: GLS (the author)
had accidentally omitted the `@' in front of `F^B', which as anyone can see
is clearly the {Wrong Thing}. It worked fine the second time. There is no
space to describe all the features of TECO, but it may be of interest that
`^P' means `sort' and `J<.-Z; ... L>' is an idiomatic series of commands for
`do once for every line'. In mid-1991, TECO is pretty much one with the dust
of history, having been replaced in the affections of hackerdom by {EMACS}.
Descendants of an early (and somewhat lobotomized) version adopted by DEC can
still be found lurking on VMS and a couple of crufty PDP-11 operating
systems, however, and ports of the more advanced MIT versions remain the
focus of some antiquarian interest. see also {retrocomputing}, {write-only
language}.
