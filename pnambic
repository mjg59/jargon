 :pnambic: /p*-nam'bik/ [Acronym from the scene in the film version of "The
Wizard of Oz" in which the true nature of the wizard is first discovered:
"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain."] 1. A stage of development
of a process or function that, owing to incomplete implementation or to the
complexity of the system, requires human interaction to simulate or replace
some or all of the actions, inputs, or outputs of the process or function. 2.
Of or pertaining to a process or function whose apparent operations are
wholly or partially falsified. 3. Requiring {prestidigitization}. The
ultimate pnambic product was "Dan Bricklin's Demo", a program which supported
flashy user-interface design prototyping. There is a related maxim among
hackers: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a
rigged demo." see {magic}, sense 1, for illumination of this point.
