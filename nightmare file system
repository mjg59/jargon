 :Nightmare File System: n. Pejorative hackerism for Sun's Network File
System (NFS). In any nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS
cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up. Some
machine tries to access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats
indefinitely. This causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is
actually happening is that it is locked up in what should have been a brief
excursion to a higher {spl} level). Then another machine tries to reach
either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes
pseudo-down. The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both to
access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even
harder to reach. This situation snowballs very fast, and soon the entire
network of machines is frozen --- worst of all, the user can't even abort the
file access that started the problem! Many of NFS's problems are excused by
partisans as being an inevitable result of its statelessness, which is held
to be a great feature (critics, of course, call it a great {misfeature}).
(ITS partisans are apt to cite this as proof of UNIX's alleged bogosity; ITS
had a working NFS-like shared file system with none of these problems in the
early 1970s.) see also {broadcast storm}.
