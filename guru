 GURU n. 1. A UNIX expert. Implies not only WIZARD skill but a history of
being a knowledge resource for others. Less often, used (with a qualifier)
for other experts on other systems, as in "VMS guru". 2. Amiga equivalent of
"panic" in UNIX. When the system crashes a cryptic message "GURU MEDITATION
#XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" appears, indicating what the problem was. An Amiga guru
can figure things out from the numbers. Generally a GURU event must be
followed by a VULCAN NERVE PINCH. = H =
