 :banana problem: n. [from the story of the little girl who said "I know how
to spell `banana', but I don't know when to stop"]. Not knowing where or when
to bring a production to a close (compare {fencepost error}). One may say
there is a banana problem of an algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect
termination conditions, or in discussing the evolution of a design that may
be succumbing to featuritis (see also {creeping elegance}, {creeping
featuritis}). see item 176 under {HAKMEM}, which describes a banana problem
in a {Dissociated Press} implementation. Also, see {one-banana problem} for a
superficially similar but unrelated usage.
