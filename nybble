 :nybble: /nib'l/ (alt. `nibble') [from v. `nibble' by analogy with `bite' =>
`byte'] n. Four bits; one {hex} digit; a half-byte. Though `byte' is now
techspeak, this useful relative is still jargon. Compare {{byte}}, {crumb},
{tayste}, {dynner}; see also {bit}, {nickle}, {deckle}. Apparently this
spelling is uncommon in Commonwealth Hackish, as British orthography suggests
the pronunciation /ni:'bl/.
