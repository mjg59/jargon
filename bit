 BIT [from the unit of information] n. 1. The unit of information; the amount
of information obtained by asking a yes-or-no question (this is straight
technicalese). 2. A computational quantity that can take on one of two
values, such as true and false, or zero and one. 3. A mental flag: a reminder
that something should be done eventually. Example: "I have a bit set for
you." (I haven't seen you for a while, and I'm supposed to tell or ask you
something.) A bit is said to be "set" if its value is true or one, and
"reset" or "clear" if its value is false or zero. One speaks of setting and
clearing bits. To "toggle" or "invert" a bit is to change it, either from
zero to one or from one to zero.
