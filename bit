 BIT n. 1. The unit of information; the amount of information obtained by
asking a yes-or-no question. "Bits" is often used simply to mean information,
as in "Give me bits about DPL replicators". 2. [By extension from "interrupt
bits" on a computer] A reminder that something should be done or talked about
eventually. Upon seeing someone that you haven't talked to for a while, it's
common for one or both to say, "I have a bit set for you."
