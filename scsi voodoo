 :SCSI voodoo: /skuz'ee voo'doo/ [common among Mac users] {SCSI} interface
hardware is notoriously fickle of temperament. Often, the SCSI bus will fail
to work unless the cable order of devices is re-arranged, SCSI termination is
added or removed (sometimes double-termination or _no_ termination will fix
the problem), or particular devices are given particular SCSI IDs. The skills
needed to trick the naturally skittish demons of SCSI into working are
collectively known as SCSI voodoo. Compare {magic}, {deep magic}, {heavy
wizardry}, {rain dance}, {cargo cult programming}, {wave a dead chicken},
{voodoo programming}. While ordinary mortals frequently experience
near-terminal frustration when attempting to configure SCSI device chains, it
is said that a true master of this arcane art can (through rituals involving
chicken blood, ground rhino horn, hairs of a virgin, eye of newt, etc.) hook
up your personal computer with three scanners, a Zip drive, an IDE hard
drive, a home weather station, a Smith-Corona typewriter, and the neighbor's
garage door.
