 :Python: /pi:'thon/ In the words of its author, "the other scripting
language" (other than {Perl}, that is). Python's design is notably clean,
elegant, and well thought through; it tends to attract the sort of
programmers who find Perl grubby and exiguous. Some people revolt at its use
of whitespace to define logical structure by indentation, objecting that this
harks back to the horrible old fixed-field languages of the 1960s. Python's
relationship with Perl is rather like the {BSD} community's relationship to
{Linux} - it's the smaller party in a (usually friendly) rivalry, but the
average quality of its developers is generally conceded to be rather higher
than in the larger community it competes with. There's a Python resource page
at `http://www.python.org'. see also {Guido}, {BDFL}. = Q = =====
