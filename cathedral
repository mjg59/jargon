 :cathedral: n.,adj. [see {bazaar} for derivation] The `classical' mode of
software engineering long thought to be necessarily implied by {Brooks's
Law}. Features small teams, tight project control, and long release
intervals. This term came into use after analysis of the Linux experience
suggested there might be something wrong (or at least incomplete) in the
classical assumptions.
