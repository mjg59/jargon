 :filter: /n./ [orig. {{Unix}}, now also in {{MS-DOS}}] A program that
processes an input data stream into an output data stream in some
well-defined way, and does no I/O to anywhere else except possibly on error
conditions; one designed to be used as a stage in a `pipeline' (see
{plumbing}). Compare {sponge}.
