 COKEBOTTLE /kohk'bot-l/ n. Any very unusual character, particularly one that
isn't on your keyboard so you can't type it. MIT people used to complain
about the "control-meta-cokebottle" commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
complained right back about the "altmode-altmode-cokebottle" commands at MIT.
Since the demise of the SPACE-CADET KEYBOARD this is no longer a serious
usage, but may be invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or
non-intuitive keystroke command.
