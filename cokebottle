 :cokebottle: /kohk´bot·l/, n. Any very unusual character, particularly one
you can't type because it isn't on your keyboard. MIT people used to complain
about the `control-meta-cokebottle' commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
complained right back about the `escape-escape-cokebottle' commands at MIT.
After the demise of the {space-cadet keyboard}, cokebottle faded away as
serious usage, but was often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified)
weird or non-intuitive keystroke command. It may be due for a second inning,
however. The OSF/Motif window manager, mwm(1), has a reserved keystroke for
switching to the default set of keybindings and behavior. This keystroke is
(believe it or not) `control-meta-bang' (see {bang}). Since the exclamation
point looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have begun
referring to this keystroke as cokebottle. see also {quadruple bucky}.
