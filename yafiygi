 :YAFIYGI: /yaf'ee-y*-gee/ /adj./ [coined in response to WYSIWYG] Describes
the command-oriented ed/vi/nroff/TeX style of word processing or other user
interface, the opposite of {WYSIWYG}. Stands for "You asked for it, you got
it", because what you actually asked for is often not apparent until long
after it is too late to do anything about it. Used to denote perversity
("Real Programmers use YAFIYGI tools...and *like* it!") or, less often, a
necessary tradeoff ("Only a YAFIYGI tool can have full programmable
flexibility in its interface."). This precise sense of "You asked for it, you
got it" seems to have first appeared in Ed Post's classic parody "Real
Programmers don't use Pascal" (see {Real Programmer}s); the acronym is a more
recent invention.
