Good" became standard] v. 1. To make changes to a file, often large-scale,

accidentally, occasionally maliciously. The system only mungs things
maliciously; this ia a consequence of Murphy's Law. see SCRIBBLE, MANGLE,

usual in speech, but the spelling `mung' is still common in program comments.

their real name! Mung beans! Really!)
