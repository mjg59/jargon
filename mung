 :mung: /muhng/ /vt./ [in 1960 at MIT, `Mash Until No Good'; sometime after
that the derivation from the {{recursive acronym}} `Mung Until No Good'
became standard; but see {munge}] 1. To make changes to a file, esp.
large-scale and irrevocable changes. see {BLT}. 2. To destroy, usually
accidentally, occasionally maliciously. The system only mungs things
maliciously; this is a consequence of {Finagle's Law}. see {scribble},
{mangle}, {trash}, {nuke}. Reports from {Usenet} suggest that the
pronunciation /muhnj/ is now usual in speech, but the spelling `mung' is
still common in program comments (compare the widespread confusion over the
proper spelling of {kluge}). 3. The kind of beans of which the sprouts are
used in Chinese food. (That's their real name! Mung beans! Really!) Like many
early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at {TMRC}; it was
already in use there in 1958. Peter Samson (compiler of the original TMRC
lexicon) thinks it may originally have been onomatopoeic for the sound of a
relay spring (contact) being twanged. However, it is known that during the
World Wars, `mung' was U.S. army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef
better known as `SOS', and it seems quite likely that the word in fact goes
back to Scots-dialect {munge}.
