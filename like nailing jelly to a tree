 :like nailing jelly to a tree: adj. Used to describe a task thought to be
impossible, esp. one in which the difficulty arises from poor specification
or inherent slipperiness in the problem domain. "Trying to display the
`prettiest' arrangement of nodes and arcs that diagrams a given graph is like
nailing jelly to a tree, because nobody's sure what `prettiest' means
algorithmically."
