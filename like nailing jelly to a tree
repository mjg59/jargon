 :like nailing jelly to a tree: adj. Used to describe a task thought to be
impossible, esp. one in which the difficulty arises from poor specification
or inherent slipperiness in the problem domain. "Trying to display the
`prettiest' arrangement of nodes and arcs that diagrams a given graph is like
nailing jelly to a tree, because nobody's sure what `prettiest' means
algorithmically." Hacker use of this term may recall mainstream slang
originated early in the 20th century by President Theodore Roosevelt. There
is a legend that, weary of inconclusive talks with Colombia over the right to
dig a canal through its then-province Panama, he remarked, "Negotiating with
those pirates is like trying to nail currant jelly to the wall." Roosevelt's
government subsequently encouraged the anti-Colombian insurgency that created
the nation of Panama.
