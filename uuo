 UUO (you-you-oh) [short for "Un-Used Operation"] n. A DEC-10 system monitor
call. The term "Un-Used Operation" comes from the fact that, on DEC-10
systems, monitor calls are implemented as invalid or illegal machine
instructions, which cause traps to the monitor (see TRAP). The SAIL manual
describing the available UUO's has a cover pic- ture showing an unidentified
underwater object. see YOYO. [Note: DEC sales people have since decided that
"Un-Used Operation" sounds bad, so UUO now stands for "Unimplemented User
Operation."] Tenex and Twenex sys- tems use the JSYS machine instruction
(q.v.), which is halfway between a legal machine instruction and a UUO, since
KA-10 Tenices implement it as a hardware instruc- tion which can be used as
an ordinary subroutine call (sort of a "pure JSR").
