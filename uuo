 UUO (yoo-yoo-oh) [short for "Un-Used Operation"] n. A PDP-10 system monitor
call. The term "Un-Used Operation" comes from the fact that, on PDP-10
systems, monitor calls are implemented as invalid or illegal machine
instructions, which cause traps to the monitor (see TRAP). The SAIL manual
describing the available UUOs has a cover picture showing an unidentified
underwater object. see YOYO. [Note: DEC sales people have since decided that
"Un-Used Operation" sounds bad, so UUO now stands for "Unimplemented User
Operation".] Tenex and Twenex systems use the JSYS machine instruction
(q.v.), which is halfway between a legal machine instruction and a UUO, since
KA-10 Tenices implement it as a hardware instruction which can be used as an
ordinary subroutine call (sort of a "pure JSR").
