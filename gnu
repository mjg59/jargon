 :GNU: /gnoo/, _not_ /noo/ 1. [acronym: `GNU's Not Unix!', see {{recursive
acronym}}] A Unix-workalike development effort of the Free Software
Foundation headed by Richard Stallman <<rms@gnu.org>>. GNU EMACS and the GNU
C compiler, two tools designed for this project, have become very popular in
hackerdom and elsewhere. The GNU project was designed partly to proselytize
for RMS's position that information is community property and all software
source should be shared. One of its slogans is "Help stamp out software
hoarding!" Though this remains controversial (because it implicitly denies
any right of designers to own, assign, and sell the results of their labors),
many hackers who disagree with RMS have nevertheless cooperated to produce
large amounts of high-quality software for free redistribution under the Free
Software Foundation's imprimatur. The GNU project has a web page at
`http://www.gnu.org'. see {EMACS}, {copyleft}, {General Public Virus},
{Linux}. 2. Noted Unix hacker John Gilmore <<gnu@toad.com>>, founder of
Usenet's anarchic alt.* hierarchy.
