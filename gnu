 GNU: /gnoo/, *not* /noo/ 1. [acronym for "GNU's Not UNIX!"] A UNIX-workalike
development effort of the Free Software Foundation headed by Richard Stallman
(rms@prep.ai.mit.edu). GNU EMACS and the GNU C compiler, two tools designed
for this project, have become very popular in hackerdom. The GNU project was
designed partly to proselytize for RMS's position that information is
community property and all software source should be shared (one of its
slogans is "Help stamp out software hoarding!"). Though this remains
controversial (because it implicitly denies any right of designers to own,
assign and sell the results of their labors), many hackers who disagree with
him have nevertheless cooperated to produce large amounts of high-quality
software available for free redistribution under the Free Software Foundation
imprimatur. see {EMACS}, {copyleft}, {General Public Virus}. 2. Noted UNIX
hacker John Gilmore (gnu@toad.com), founder of USENET's anarchic alt.*
hierarchy.
