 GNU: /gnoo/, *not* /noo/ 1. [acronym, `GNU's Not UNIX!', see {{recursive
acronyms}}] A UNIX-workalike development effort of the Free Software
Foundation headed by Richard Stallman (rms@mole.ai.mit.edu). GNU EMACS and
the GNU C compiler, two tools designed for this project, have become very
popular in hackerdom and elsewhere. The GNU project was designed partly to
proselytize for RMS's position that information is community property and all
software source should be shared. One of its slogans is "Help stamp out
software hoarding!" Though this remains controversial (because it implicitly
denies any right of designers to own, assign, and sell the results of their
labors), many hackers who disagree with him have nevertheless cooperated to
produce large amounts of high-quality software available for free
redistribution under the Free Software Foundation imprimatur. see {EMACS},

(gnu@toad.com), founder of USENET's anarchic alt.* hierarchy.
