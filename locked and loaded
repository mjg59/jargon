 :locked and loaded: adj. [from military slang for an M-16 rifle with
magazine inserted and prepared for firing] Said of a removable disk volume
properly prepared for use -- that is, locked into the drive and with the
heads loaded. Ironically, because their heads are `loaded' whenever the power
is up, this description is never used of {{Winchester}} drives (which are
named after a rifle).
