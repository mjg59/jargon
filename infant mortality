 INFANT MORTALITY n. It is common lore among hackers that the chances of
sudden hardware failure drop off exponentially with a machine's time since
power-up (that is until the relatively distant time at which mechanical wear
in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has accumulated
enough for the machine to start going senile). Up to half of all
chip-and-wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
failures are often referred to as "infant mortality" problems.
