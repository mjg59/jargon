 :infant mortality: n. It is common lore among hackers (and in the
electronics industry at large; this term is possibly techspeak by now) that
the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off exponentially with a
machine's time since power-up (that is, until the relatively distant time at
which enough mechanical wear in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in
components has accumulated for the machine to start going senile). Up to half
of all chip and wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks;
such failures are often referred to as `infant mortality' problems (or,
occasionally, as `sudden infant death syndrome'). see {bathtub curve},
{burn-in period}.
