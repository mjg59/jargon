 :demon: n. 1. Often used equivalently to {daemon} -- especially in the
{Unix} world, where the latter spelling and pronunciation is considered
mildly archaic. 2. [MIT; now probably obsolete] A portion of a program that
is not invoked explicitly, but that lies dormant waiting for some
condition(s) to occur. see {daemon}. The distinction is that demons are
usually processes within a program, while daemons are usually programs
running on an operating system. Demons in sense 2 are particularly common in
AI programs. For example, a knowledge-manipulation program might implement
inference rules as demons. Whenever a new piece of knowledge was added,
various demons would activate (which demons depends on the particular piece
of data) and would create additional pieces of knowledge by applying their
respective inference rules to the original piece. These new pieces could in
turn activate more demons as the inferences filtered down through chains of
logic. Meanwhile, the main program could continue with whatever its primary
task was.
