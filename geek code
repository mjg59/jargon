 :geek code: n. (also "Code of the Geeks"). A set of codes commonly used in
{sig block}s to broadcast the interests, skills, and aspirations of the
poster. Features a G at the left margin followed by numerous letter codes,
often suffixed with plusses or minuses. Because many net users are involved
in computer science, the most common prefix is `GCS'. To see a copy of the
current code, browse http://www.geekcode.com/. Here is a sample geek code
(that of Robert Hayden, the code's inventor) from that page: -----BEGIN GEEK

------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------ The geek code originated in 1993; it was
inspired (according to the inventor) by previous "bear", "smurf" and "twink"
style-and-sexual-preference codes from lesbian and gay {newsgroup}s. It has
in turn spawned imitators; there is now even a "Saturn geek code" for owners
of the Saturn car. see also {geek}.
