 :geek code: /n./ A set of codes commonly used in {sig block}s to broadcast
the interests, skills, and aspirations of the poster. Features a G at the
left margin followed by numerous letter codes, often suffixed with plusses or
minuses. Because many net users are involved in computer science, the most
common prefix is `GCS'. To see a copy of the current Code of the Geeks,

originated in 1993; it was inspired (according to the author) by previous
"bear", "smurf" and "twink" style-and-sexual-preference codes from lesbian
and gay {newsgroup}s. It has on turn spawned imitators, there is now even a
"Saturn geek code" for owners of the Saturn car. see also {computer geek}.
