 MUSIC n. A common extracurricular interest of hackers (compare
SCIENCE-FICTION FANDOM, ORIENTAL FOOD; see also FILK). It is widely believed
among hackers that there is a substantial correlation between whatever
mysterious traits underlie hacking ability (on the one hand) and musical
talent and sensitivity (on the other). It is certainly the case that hackers,
as a rule, like music and often develop musical appreciation in unusual and
interesting directions. Folk music is very big in hacker circles; so is the
sort of elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called `progressive'
and isn't recorded much any more. Also, the hacker's musical range tends to
be wide; many can listen with equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes,
Spirogyra, Scott Joplin, King Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, or one of Bach's
Brandenburg Concerti. It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a
much higher concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect
from a similar-sized control group of MUNDANES.
