 :music: n. A common extracurricular interest of hackers (compare
{science-fiction fandom}, {oriental food}; see also {filk}). Hackish folklore
has long claimed that musical and programming abilities are closely related,
and there has been at least one large-scale statistical study that supports
this. Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical appreciation
in unusual and interesting directions. Folk music is very big in hacker
circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of elaborate instrumental
jazz/rock that used to be called `progressive' and isn't recorded much any
more. The hacker's musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal
appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat Metheny, Scott
Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny Ade, The Pretenders,
Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti. It is also apparently true that
hackerdom includes a much higher concentration of talented amateur musicians
than one would expect from a similar-sized control group of {mundane} types.
