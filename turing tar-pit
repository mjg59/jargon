 :Turing tar-pit: n. 1. A place where anything is possible but nothing of
interest is practical. Alan Turing helped lay the foundations of computer
science by showing that all machines and languages capable of expressing a
certain very primitive set of operations are logically equivalent in the
kinds of computations they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities
that differ only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
designed computers. However, no machine or language exactly matching Turing's
primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a classroom
exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too painful to use. A
Turing tar-pit is any computer language or other tool that shares this
property. That is, it's theoretically universal -- but in practice, the
harder you struggle to get any real work done, the deeper its inadequacies
suck you in. Compare {bondage-and-discipline language}. 2. The perennial
{holy wars} over whether language A or B is the "most powerful".
