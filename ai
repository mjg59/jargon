 2. [techspeak] A report on the amounts of time spent in each routine of a
program, used to find and {tune} away the {hot spot}s in it. This sense is
often verbed. Some profiling modes report units other than time (such as call
counts) and/or report at granularities other than per-routine, but the idea
is similar. 3.[techspeak] A subset of a standard used for a particular
purpose. This sense confuses hackers who wander into the weird world of ISO
standards no end! :progasm: /proh'gaz-m/ n. [University of Wisconsin] The
euphoria experienced upon the completion of a program or other
computer-related project. :proggy: n. 1. Any computer program that is
considered a full application. 2. Any computer program that is made up of or
otherwise contains {proglet}s. 3. Any computer program that is large enough
to be normally distributed as an RPM or {tarball}. :proglet: /prog'let/ n.
[UK] A short extempore program written to meet an immediate, transient need.
Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a dozen lines long, and containing
no subroutines. The largest amount of code that can be written off the top of
one's head, that does not need any editing, and that runs correctly the first
time (this amount varies significantly according to one's skill and the
language one is using). Compare {toy program}, {noddy}, {one-liner wars}.
:program: n. 1. A magic spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's
input into error messages. 2. An exercise in experimental epistemology. 3. A
form of art, ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers, which is
nevertheless almost inevitably a failure if other programmers can't
understand it. :Programmer's Cheer: "Shift to the left! Shift to the right!
Pop up, push down! Byte! Byte! Byte!" A joke so old it has hair on it.
:programming: n. 1. The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper (or, in these
days of on-line editing, the art of debugging an empty file). "Bloody
instructions which, being taught, return to plague their inventor"
("Macbeth", Act 1, Scene 7) 2. A pastime similar to banging one's head
against a wall, but with fewer opportunities for reward. 3. The most fun you
can have with your clothes on. 4. The least fun you can have with your
clothes off. :programming fluid: n. 1. Coffee. 2. Cola. 3. Any caffeinacious
stimulant. Many hackers consider these essential for those all-night hacking
runs. see {wirewater}. :propeller head: n. Used by hackers, this is syn. with
{computer geek}. Non-hackers sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob.
derives from SF fandom's tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray
Faraday Nelson) of propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody
actually wears them except as a joke). :propeller key: n. [Mac users] see
{feature key}. :proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies
a product imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the
company's own hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers
and users, inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems
standards, and thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able
to gouge freely on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has
locked the customer in. Often in the phrase "proprietary crap". 3. Synonym
for closed-source, e.g. software issued in binary without source and under a
restructive license. Since the coining of the term {open source}, many
hackers have made a conscious effort to distinguish between `proprietary' and
`commercial' software. It is possible for software to be commercial (that is,
intended to make a profit for the producers) without being proprietary. The
reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only freeware. :protocol: n.
As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper form for
addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one should use
the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care about such
things. It is used instead to describe any set of rules that allow different
machines or pieces of software to coordinate with each other without
ambiguity. So, for example, it does include niceties about the proper form
for addressing packets on a network or the order in which one should use the
forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem. It implies that there is some
common message format and an accepted set of primitives or commands that all
parties involved understand, and that transactions among them follow
predictable logical sequences. see also {handshaking}, {do protocol}.
:provocative maintenance: n. [common ironic mutation of `preventive
maintenance'] Actions performed upon a machine at regularly scheduled
intervals to ensure that the system remains in a usable state. So called
because it is all too often performed by a {field servoid} who doesn't know
what he is doing; such `maintenance' often _induces_ problems, or otherwise
results in the machine's remaining in an _un_usable state for an
indeterminate amount of time. see also {scratch monkey}. :prowler: n. [Unix]
A {daemon} that is run periodically (typically once a week) to seek out and
erase {core} files, truncate administrative logfiles, nuke `lost+found'
directories, and otherwise clean up the {cruft} that tends to pile up in the
corners of a file system. see also {GFR}, {reaper}, {skulker}. :pseudo:
/soo'doh/ n. [Usenet: truncation of `pseudonym'] 1. An electronic-mail or
{Usenet} persona adopted by a human for amusement value or as a means of
avoiding negative repercussions of one's net.behavior; a `nom de Usenet',
often associated with forged postings designed to conceal message origins.
Perhaps the best-known and funniest hoax of this type is {B1FF}. see also
{tentacle}. 2. Notionally, a {flamage}-generating AI program simulating a
Usenet user. Many flamers have been accused of actually being such entities,
despite the fact that no AI program of the required sophistication yet
exists. However, in 1989 there was a famous series of forged postings that
used a phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of
several well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their back
postings (compare {Dissociated Press}). A significant number of people were
fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over their authenticity was settled
only when the perpetrator came forward to publicly admit the hoax.
:pseudoprime: n. A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied points) with
one point missing. This term is an esoteric pun derived from number theory: a
number that passes a certain kind of "primality test" may be called a
`pseudoprime' (all primes pass any such test, but so do some composite
numbers), and any number that passes several is, in some sense, almost
certainly prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems from the idea that a
pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the same job unless you
are unlucky. :pseudosuit: /soo'doh-s[y]oot`/ n. A {suit} wannabee; a hacker
who has decided that he wants to be in management or administration and
begins wearing ties, sport coats, and (shudder!) suits voluntarily. It's his
funeral. see also {lobotomy}. :psychedelicware: /si:`k*-del'-ik-weir/ n. [UK]
Syn. {display hack}. see also {smoking clover}. :psyton: /si:'ton/ n. [TMRC]
The elementary particle carrying the sinister force. The probability of a
process losing is proportional to the number of psytons falling on it.
Psytons are generated by observers, which is why demos are more likely to
fail when lots of people are watching. [This term appears to have been
largely superseded by {bogon}; see also {quantum bogodynamics}. --ESR] :pubic
directory: /pyoob'ik d*-rek't*-ree/) n. [NYU] (also `pube directory' /pyoob'
d*-rek't*-ree/) The `pub' (public) directory on a machine that allows {FTP}
access. So called because it is the default location for {SEX} (sense 1).
"I'll have the source in the pube directory by Friday." :puff: vt. To
decompress data that has been crunched by Huffman coding. At least one widely
distributed Huffman decoder program was actually _named_ `PUFF', but these
days it is usually packaged with the encoder. Oppose {huff}, see {inflate}.
:pumpkin holder: n. see {patch pumpkin}. :pumpking: n. Syn. for {pumpkin
holder}; see {patch pumpkin}. :punched card:: n.obs. [techspeak] (alt. `punch
card') The signature medium of computing's {Stone Age}, now obsolescent
outside of some IBM shops. The punched card actually predated computers
considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for mechanical looms.
The version patented by Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating
machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215
mm. There is a widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the currency
trays used for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have
falsified this. IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer)
married the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as
patterns of small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per
card. Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at
various times. The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of
the
