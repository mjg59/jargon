 DEMIGOD (de'mi-god) n. Hacker with years of experience, a national
reputation, and a major role in the development of at least one design, tool
or game used by or known to more than 50% of the hacker community. To qualify
as a genuine demigod, the person must recognizably identify with the hacker
community and have helped shape it. Major demigods include Ken Thompson and
Dennis Ritchie (co-inventors of UNIX and C) and Richard M. Stallman (inventor
of EMACS). In their hearts of hearts most hackers dream of someday becoming
demigods themselves, and more than one major software project has been driven
to completion by the author's veiled hopes of apotheosis. see also NET.GOD,
