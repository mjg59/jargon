 :demigod: n. A hacker with years of experience, a national reputation, and a
major role in the development of at least one design, tool, or game used by
or known to more than half of the hacker community. To qualify as a genuine
demigod, the person must recognizably identify with the hacker community and
have helped shape it. Major demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
(co-inventors of {{UNIX}} and {C}), Richard M. Stallman (inventor of
{EMACS}), and Linus Torvalds (inventor of Linux). In their hearts of hearts,
most hackers dream of someday becoming demigods themselves, and more than one
major software project has been driven to completion by the author's veiled
hopes of apotheosis. see also {net.god}, {true-hacker}.
