 :demigod: n. A hacker with years of experience, a world-wide reputation, and
a major role in the development of at least one design, tool, or game used by
or known to more than half of the hacker community. To qualify as a genuine
demigod, the person must recognizably identify with the hacker community and
have helped shape it. Major demigods include Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
(co-inventors of {Unix} and {C}), Richard M. Stallman (inventor of {EMACS}),
Larry Wall (inventor of {Perl}), Linus Torvalds (inventor of {Linux}), and
most recently James Gosling (inventor of Java, {NeWS}, and {GOSMACS}) and
Guido van Rossum (inventor of {Python}). In their hearts of hearts, most
hackers dream of someday becoming demigods themselves, and more than one
major software project has been driven to completion by the author's veiled
hopes of apotheosis. see also {net.god}, {true-hacker}, {ubergeek}. Since
1995 or so this term has been gradually displaced by {ubergeek}.
