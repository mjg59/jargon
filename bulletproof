 :bulletproof: adj. Used of an algorithm or implementation considered
extremely {robust}; lossage-resistant; capable of correctly recovering from
any imaginable exception condition -- a rare and valued quality. Implies that
the programmer has thought of all possible errors, and added {code} to
protect against each one. Thus, in some cases, this can imply code that is
too heavyweight, due to excessive paranoia on the part of the programmer.
Syn. {armor-plated}.
