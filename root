 ROOT n. [UNIX] 1. The top node of the system directory structure (home
directory of the root user). 2. The "superuser" account that ignores
permission bits, user number zero on a UNIX system. This account has the user
name `root'. 3. By extension, the privileged system-maintenance login on any
OS. 4. Thus, ROOT MODE: Syn. with WIZARD MODE or WHEEL MODE. Like these, it
is often generalized to describe privileged states in systems other than OSs.
5. GO ROOT: to temporarily enter ROOT MODE in order to perform a privileged
operation. This use is deprecated in Australia, where v. "root" is slang for
"to have sex with".
