 CHEMIST [Cambridge University] n. Someone who wastes CPU time on
number-crunching when you'd far rather the CPU was doing something more
productive, such as working out anagrams of your name or printing Snoopy
calendars or running LIFE patterns. May or may not refer to someone who
actually studies chemistry.
