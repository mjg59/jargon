 :Ping O' Death: n. A notorious {exploit} that (when first discovered) could
be easily used to crash a wide variety of machines by overunning size limits
in their TCP/IP stacks. First revealed in late 1996. The open-source Unix
community patched its systems to remove the vulnerability within days or
weeks, the closed-source OS vendors generally took months. While the
difference in response times repeated a pattern familiar from other security
incidents, the accompanying glare of Web-fueled publicity proved unusually
embarrassing to the OS vendors and so passed into history and myth. The term
is now used to refer to any nudge delivered by network wizards over the
network that causes bad things to happen on the system being nudged. For the
full story on the original exploit, see

packet,' 'Finger of Death' and 'Chernobyl packet.'
