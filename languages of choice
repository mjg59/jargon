 :languages of choice: n. {C} and {LISP}. Nearly every hacker knows one of
these, and most good ones are fluent in both. Smalltalk and Prolog are also
popular in small but influential communities. There is also a rapidly
dwindling category of older hackers with FORTRAN, or even assembler, as their
language of choice. They often prefer to be known as {Real Programmer}s, and
other hackers consider them a bit odd (see "{The Story of Mel, a Real
Programmer}" in {appendix A}). Assembler is generally no longer considered
interesting or appropriate for anything but {HLL} implementation, {glue}, and
a few time-critical and hardware-specific uses in systems programs. FORTRAN
occupies a shrinking niche in scientific programming. Most hackers tend to
frown on languages like {{Pascal}} and {{Ada}}, which don't give them the
near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking (see
{bondage-and-discipline language}), and to regard everything that's even
remotely connected with {COBOL} or other traditional {card walloper}
languages as a total and unmitigated {loss}.
