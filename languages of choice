 :languages of choice: n. {C}, {Perl}, {Python}, {Java} and {LISP} -- the
dominant languages in open-source development. This list has changed over
time, but slowly. Java bumped C++ off of it, and Python appears to be
recruiting people who would otherwise gravitate to LISP (which used to be
much more important than it is now). Smalltalk and Prolog are also popular in
small but influential communities. The {Real Programmer}s who loved FORTRAN
and assembler have pretty much all retired or died since 1990. Assembler is
generally no longer considered interesting or appropriate for anything but
{HLL} implementation, {glue}, and a few time-critical and hardware-specific
uses in systems programs. FORTRAN occupies a shrinking niche in scientific
programming. Most hackers tend to frown on languages like {Pascal} and Ada,
which don't give them the near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking
(see {bondage-and-discipline language}), and to regard everything even
remotely connected with {COBOL} or other traditional {DP} languages as a
total and unmitigated {loss}.
