 :languages of choice: /n./ {C}, {C++}, {LISP}, and {Perl}. Nearly every
hacker knows one of C or LISP, and most good ones are fluent in both. C++,
despite some serious drawbacks, is generally preferred to other
object-oriented language (though in 1996 it looks as though Java may soon
displace it in the affections of hackers, if not everywhere). Since around
1990 Perl has rapidly been gaining favor, especially as a tool for
systems-administration utilities and rapid prototyping. Smalltalk and Prolog
are also popular in small but influential communities. There is also a
rapidly dwindling category of older hackers with FORTRAN, or even assembler,
as their language of choice. They often prefer to be known as {Real
Programmer}s, and other hackers consider them a bit odd (see "{The Story of
Mel, a Real Programmer}" in Appendix A). Assembler is generally no longer
considered interesting or appropriate for anything but {HLL} implementation,
{glue}, and a few time-critical and hardware-specific uses in systems
programs. FORTRAN occupies a shrinking niche in scientific programming. Most
hackers tend to frown on languages like {{Pascal}} and {{Ada}}, which don't
give them the near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking (see
{bondage-and-discipline language}), and to regard everything even remotely
connected with {COBOL} or other traditional {card walloper} languages as a
total and unmitigated {loss}.
