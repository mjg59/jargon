 :languages of choice: n. {C}, {LISP}, and {Perl}. Nearly every hacker knows
one of C or Lisp, and most good ones are fluent in both. Over the last years,
Perl has rapidly been gaining favor, especially as a tool for
systems-administration utilities and rapid prototyping. Smalltalk and Prolog
are also popular in small but influential communities. There is also a
rapidly dwindling category of older hackers with FORTRAN, or even assembler,
as their language of choice. They often prefer to be known as {Real
Programmer}s, and other hackers consider them a bit odd (see "{The Story of
Mel, a Real Programmer}" in Appendix A). Assembler is generally no longer
considered interesting or appropriate for anything but {HLL} implementation,
{glue}, and a few time-critical and hardware-specific uses in systems
programs. FORTRAN occupies a shrinking niche in scientific programming. Most
hackers tend to frown on languages like {{Pascal}} and {{Ada}}, which don't
give them the near-total freedom considered necessary for hacking (see
{bondage-and-discipline language}), and to regard everything even remotely
connected with {COBOL} or other traditional {card walloper} languages as a
total and unmitigated {loss}.
