 LANGUAGES OF CHOICE n. C or LISP. Essentially all hackers know one of these
and most good ones are fluent in both. Smalltalk and Prolog are popular in
small but influential communities. Assembler used to be a language of choice,
but is generally no longer considered interesting or appropriate for anything
but compiler code generation and a few time-critical uses in systems
programs.
