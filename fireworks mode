 :fireworks mode: n. 1. The mode a machine is sometimes said to be in when it
is performing a {crash and burn} operation. 2. There is (or was) a more
specific meaning of this term in the Amiga community. The word fireworks
described the effects of a particularly serious crash which prevented the
video pointer(s) from getting reset at the start of the vertical blank. This
caused the DAC to scroll through the entire contents of CHIP (video or
video+CPU) memory. Since each bit plane would scroll separately this was
quite a spectacular effect.
