 :life: /n./ 1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton Conway and
first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner ("Scientific American", October
1970); the game's popularity had to wait a few years for computers on which
it could reasonably be played, as it's no fun to simulate the cells by hand.
Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and hackers at
various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of this game
(most notably Bill Gosper at MIT, who even implemented life in {TECO}!; see
{Gosperism}). When a hacker mentions `life', he is much more likely to mean
this game than the magazine, the breakfast cereal, or the human state of
existence. 2. The opposite of {Usenet}. As in "{Get a life!}"
