 LIFE n. 1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton Conway, and
first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner (Scientific American, October
1970). Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and hackers
at various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of this
game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT; see GOSPERISM). When a hacker mentions
"life", he is much more likely to mean this game than the magazine, the
breakfast cereal, or the human state of existence. 2. The opposite of USENET.
As in "Get a life!".
