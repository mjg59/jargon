 BITNET was also notorious as the apparent home of {B1FF}. By 1995 it had,
much to everyone's relief, been obsolesced and absorbed into the Internet.
Unfortunately, around this time we also got AOL. :bits: pl.n. 1. Information.
Examples: "I need some bits about file formats." ("I need to know about file
formats.") Compare {core dump}, sense 4. 2. Machine-readable representation
of a document, specifically as contrasted with paper: "I have only a
photocopy of the Jargon File; does anyone know where I can get the bits?".
see {softcopy}, {source of all good bits} see also {bit}. :bitty box: /bit'ee
boks/ n. 1. A computer sufficiently small, primitive, or incapable as to
cause a hacker acute claustrophobia at the thought of developing software on
or for it. Especially used of small, obsolescent, single-tasking-only
personal machines such as the Atari 800, Osborne, Sinclair, VIC-20, TRS-80,
or IBM PC. 2. [Pejorative] More generally, the opposite of `real computer'
(see {Get a real computer!}). see also {mess-dos}, {toaster}, and {toy}.
:bixen: pl.n. Users of BIX (the BIX Information eXchange, formerly the Byte
Information eXchange). Parallels other plurals like boxen, {VAXen}, oxen.
:bixie: /bik'see/ n. Variant {emoticon}s used on BIX (the BIX Information
eXchange). The most common ({smiley}) bixie is <@_@>, representing two
cartoon eyes and a mouth. These were originally invented in an SF fanzine
called APA-L and imported to BIX by one of the earliest users. :black art: n.
[common] A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication) mostly
ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or systems area
(compare {black magic}). VLSI design and compiler code optimization were (in
their beginnings) considered classic examples of black art; as theory
developed they became {deep magic}, and once standard textbooks had been
written, became merely {heavy wizardry}. The huge proliferation of formal and
informal channels for spreading around new computer-related technologies
during the last twenty years has made both the term `black art' and what it
describes less common than formerly. see also {voodoo programming}. :black
hole: n.,vt. [common] What data (a piece of email or netnews, or a stream of
TCP/IP packets) has fallen into if it disappears mysteriously between its
origin and destination sites (that is, without returning a {bounce message}).
"I think there's a black hole at foovax!" conveys suspicion that site foovax
has been dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately (see {drop on the
floor}). The implied metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting
in itself. Readily verbed as `blackhole': "That router is blackholing IDP
packets." Compare {bit bucket} and see {RBL}. :black magic: n. [common] A
technique that works, though nobody really understands why. More obscure than
{voodoo programming}, which may be done by cookbook. Compare also {black
art}, {deep magic}, and {magic number} (sense 2). :Black Screen of Death: n.
[prob. related to the Floating Head of Death in a famous "Far Side" cartoon.]
A failure mode of {Microsloth Windows}. On an attempt to launch a DOS box, a
networked Windows system not uncommonly blanks the screen and locks up the PC
so hard that it requires a cold {boot} to recover. This unhappy phenomenon is
known as The Black Screen of Death. see also {Blue Screen of Death}, which
has become rather more common. :Black Thursday: n. February 8th, 1996 - the
day of the signing into law of the {CDA}, so called by analogy with the
catastrophic "Black Friday" in 1929 that began the Great Depression. :blammo:
v. [Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To forcibly remove someone from
any interactive system, especially talker systems. The operators, who may
remain hidden, may `blammo' a user who is misbehaving. Very similar to MIT
{gun}; in fact, the `blammo-gun' is a notional device used to `blammo'
someone. While in actual fact the only incarnation of the blammo-gun is the
command used to forcibly eject a user, operators speak of different levels of
blammo-gun fire; e.g., a blammo-gun to `stun' will temporarily remove
someone, but a blammo-gun set to `maim' will stop someone coming back on for
a while. :blargh: /blarg/ n. [MIT; now common] The opposite of {ping}, sense
5; an exclamation indicating that one has absorbed or is emitting a quantum
of unhappiness. Less common than {ping}. :blast: 1. v.,n. Synonym for {BLT},
used esp. for large data sends over a network or comm line. Opposite of
{snarf}. Usage: uncommon. The variant `blat' has been reported. 2. vt.
[HP/Apollo] Synonymous with {nuke} (sense 3). Sometimes the message `Unable
to kill all processes. Blast them (y/n)?' would appear in the command window
upon logout. :blat: n. 1. Syn. {blast}, sense 1. 2. see {thud}. :bletch:
/blech/ interj. [very common; from Yiddish/German `brechen', to vomit, poss.
via comic-strip exclamation `blech'] Term of disgust. Often used in "Ugh,
bletch". Compare {barf}. :bletcherous: /blech'*-r*s/ adj. Disgusting in
design or function; esthetically unappealing. This word is seldom used of
people. "This keyboard is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't work very
well, or are misplaced.) see {losing}, {cretinous}, {bagbiting}, {bogus}, and
{random}. The term {bletcherous} applies to the esthetics of the thing so
described; similarly for {cretinous}. By contrast, something that is `losing'
or `bagbiting' may be failing to meet objective criteria. see also {bogus}
and {random}, which have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the
above. :blink: vi.,n. To use a navigator or off-line message reader to
minimize time spent on-line to a commercial network service (a necessity in
many places outside the U.S. where the telecoms monopolies charge per-minute
for local calls). This term attained wide use in the UK, but is rare or
unknown in the US. :blinkenlights: /blink'*n-li:tz/ n. [common] Front-panel
diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a {dinosaur}. Now that dinosaurs are
rare, this term usually refers to status lights on a modem, network hub, or
the like. This term derives from the last word of the famous
blackletter-Gothic sign in mangled pseudo-German that once graced about half
the computer rooms in the English-speaking world. One version ran in its
entirety as follows: ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS! Das computermachine ist
nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrabben. Ist easy schnappen der
springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken mit spitzensparken. Ist nicht fuer
gewerken bei das dumpkopfen. Das rubbernecken sichtseeren keepen das
cotten-pickenen hans in das pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das
blinkenlichten. This silliness dates back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford
University and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it was
reported at London University's ATLAS computing site. There are several
variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with the word
`blinkenlights'. In an amusing example of turnabout-is-fair-play, German
hackers have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster in
fractured English, one of which is reproduced here: ATTENTION This room is
fullfilled mit special electronische equippment. Fingergrabbing and pressing
the cnoeppkes from the computers is allowed for die experts only! So all the
"lefthanders" stay away and do not disturben the brainstorming von here
working intelligencies. Otherwise you will be out thrown and kicked
anderswhere! Also: please keep still and only watchen astaunished the
blinkenlights. see also {geef}. Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for
blinkenlights because they were so much more fun to look at than a blank
panel. Sadly, very few computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC
keyboard certainly don't count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of
front-panel cutouts, almost nobody needs or wants to interpret
machine-register states on the fly anymore) are only part of the story.
Another part of it is that radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was
beginning to be a problem as far back as transistor machines. But the most
fundamental fact is that there are very few signals slow enough to blink an
LED these days! With slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or
instruction counter tick, but at 33/66/150MHz it's all a blur. Despite this,
a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note have featured
programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they looked cool. The
Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer designed in the
mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a grid of red
blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving {life} patterns. A few years
later the ill-fated BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS
operating system) featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When
Be, Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead
ported their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many
users severly suffered from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.
Before long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial
port became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that
it was assembled by a German. Finally, a version updated for the Internet has
been seen on news.admin.net-abuse.email: ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS! Das
Internet is nicht fuer gefingerclicken und giffengrabben. Ist easy
droppenpacket der routers und overloaden der backbone mit der spammen und der
me-tooen. Ist nicht fuer gewerken bei das dumpkopfen. Das mausklicken
sichtseeren keepen das bandwit-spewin hans in das pockets muss; relaxen und
watchen das cursorblinken. This newest version partly reflects reports that
the word `blinkenlights' is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival in
usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive lights
on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network equipment
often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated ways. Although
this is different in some ways from register readings, a tall stack of Cisco
equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can provoke a similar feeling
of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network operations center or server
room. :blit: /blit/ vt. 1. [common] To copy a large array of bits from one
part of a computer's memory to another part, particularly when the memory is
being used to determine what is shown on a display screen. "The storage
allocator picks through the table and copies the good parts up into high
memory, and then blits it all back down again." see {bitblt}, {BLT}, {dd},
{cat}, {blast}, {snarf}. More generally, to perform some operation (such as
toggling) on a large array of bits while moving them. 2. [historical, rare]
Sometimes all-capitalized as `BLIT': an early experimental bit-mapped
terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as the AT&T
5620. (The folk etymology from `Bell Labs Intelligent Terminal' is incorrect.
Its creators liked to claim that "Blit" stood for the Bacon, Lettuce, and
Interactive Tomato.) :blitter: /blit'r/ n. [common] A special-purpose chip or
hardware system built to perform {blit} operations, esp. used for fast
implementation of bit-mapped graphics. The Commodore Amiga and a few other
micros have these, but since 1990 the trend has been away from them (however,
see {cycle of reincarnation}). Syn. {raster blaster}. :blivet: /bliv'*t/ n.
[allegedly from a World War II military term meaning "ten pounds of manure in
a five-pound bag"] 1. An intractable problem. 2. A crucial piece of hardware
that can't be fixed or replaced if it breaks. 3. A tool that has been hacked
over by so many incompetent programmers that it has become an unmaintainable
tissue of hacks. 4. An out-of-control but unkillable development effort.
