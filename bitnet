 BITNET: n. Everybody's least favorite piece of the network (see {network,
the}). The BITNET hosts are a collection of IBM dinosaurs that communicate
using 80-character {{EBCDIC}} card images; thus, they tend to mangle the
headers and text of third-party traffic from the rest of the ASCII/RFC-822
world with annoying regularity. BITNET is also notorious as the apparent home
of {BIFF}. bits: n. 1. Information. Examples: "I need some bits about file
formats." ("I need to know about file formats.") Compare {core dump}, sense
#4. 2. Machine-readable representation of a document, specifically as
contrasted with paper. "I have only a photocopy of the Jargon File; does
anyone know where I can get the bits?". see {softcopy}, {source of all good
bits}. bitty box: /bit'ee boks/ n. 1. A computer sufficiently small,
primitive, or incapable as to cause a hacker acute claustrophobia at the
thought of developing for it. Especially used of small, obsolescent,
single-tasking-only personal machines like the Atari 800, Osborne, Sinclair,
VIC-20, TRS-80, or IBM PC. 2. Pejorative. More generally, the opposite of
`real computer' (see {Get a real computer!}). see also {mess-dos}, {toaster},
and {toy}. bixie: /biks'ee/ n. Variant {emoticon}s used on BIX (the Byte
Information Exchange). The `smiley' bixie is <@_@>, apparently intending to
represent two cartoon eyes and a mouth. A few others have been reported.
black art: n. A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication)
mostly ad-hoc techniques developed for a particular application or systems
area (compare {black magic}). VLSI design and compiler code optimization were
(in their beginnings) considered classic examples of black art; as theory
developed they became {deep magic}, and once standard textbooks had been
written became merely {heavy wizardry}. The huge proliferation of formal and
informal channels for spreading around new computer-related technologies
during the last twenty years has made both the term `black art' and what it
describes less common than formerly. see also {voodoo programming}. black
hole: n. When a piece of email or netnews disappears mysteriously between its
origin and destination sites (that is, without returning a {bounce message})
it is commonly said to have "fallen into a black hole". Similarly, one might
say "I think there's a black hole at foovax!" to convey suspicion that site
foovax has been dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately (see {drop on the
floor}). The implied metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting
in itself. Compare {bit bucket}. black magic: n. A technique which works,
though nobody really understands why. More obscure than {voodoo programming},
which may be done by cookbook. Compare also {black art}, {deep magic}, and
{magic number} (sense #2). blast: 1. vt.,n. Synonym for {BLT}, used esp. for
large data sends over a network or comm line. Opposite of {snarf}. Usage:
uncommon. The variant `blat' has been reported. 2. vt. [HP/Apollo] Synonymous
with {nuke} (sense #3). Sometimes the message "Unable to kill all processes.
Blast them (y/n)?" would appear in the command window upon logout. blat: n.
see {thud}. blazer: n. (also `'blazer') Nickname for the Telebit Trailblazer,
an expensive but extremely reliable and effective high-speed modem, popular
at UNIX sites that pass large volumes of {email} and {USENET} news. bletch:
/blech/ [from Yiddish/German `brechen', to vomit, poss. via comic-strip
exclamation `blech'] interj. Term of disgust. Often in "Ugh, bletch". Compare
{barf}. bletcherous: /blech'*-rus/ adj. Disgusting in design or function;
esthetically unappealing. This word is seldom used of people. "This keyboard
is bletcherous!" (Perhaps the keys don't work very well, or are misplaced).
see {losing}, {cretinous}, {bagbiter}, {bogus}, and {random}. The term
{bletcherous} applies to the esthetics of the thing so described; similarly
for `cretinous'. By contrast, something that is `losing' or `bagbiting' may
be failing to meet objective criteria. see also {bogus} and {random}, which
have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the above. blinkenlights:
/blink'*n-lietz/ n. Front-panel diagnostic lights on a computer, esp. a
{dinosaur}. Derives from the last word of the famous blackletter-Gothic
"ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS!" notice in mangled pseudo-German that once
graced about half the computer rooms in the English-speaking world. The sign
in its entirety ran: ACHTUNG! ALLES LOOKENSPEEPERS Das computermachine ist
nicht fuer gefingerpoken und mittengrabben. Ist easy schnappen der
springenwerk, blowenfusen und poppencorken mit spitzensparken. Ist nicht fuer
gewerken bei das dumpkopfen. Das rubbernecken sichtseeren keepen hans in das
pockets muss; relaxen und watchen das blinkenlichten. This silliness dates
back at least as far as 1959 at Stanford University and had already gone
international by the early '60s, when it was reported at London University's
ATLAS computing site. There are several variants of it in circulation, some
of which actually do end with the word `blinkenlights'. It is reported, by
the way, that an analogous travesty in mangled English is posted in German
computer laboratories. see also {geef}. blit: /blit/ vt. 1. To copy a large
array of bits from one part of a computer's memory to another part,
particularly when the memory is being used to determine what is shown on a
display screen. "The storage allocator picks through the table and copies the
good parts up into high memory, and at the end {blit}s it all back down
again." see {bitblt}, {BLT}, {dd}, {cat}, {blast}, {snarf}. More generally,
to perform some operation (such as toggling) on a large array of bits while
moving them. 2. All-capitalized as `BLIT': An early experimental bit-mapped
terminal designed by Rob Pike at Bell Labs, later commercialized as the AT&T
5620. The folk etymology from `Bell Labs Intelligent Terminal' is incorrect.
blitter: n. A special-purpose chip or hardware system built to perform {blit}
operations, esp. used for fast implementation of bit-mapped graphics. The
Commodore Amiga and a few other micros have these, but in 1991 the trend is
away from them (however, see {cycle of reincarnation}). Syn. {raster
blaster}. blivet: [allegedly from a World War II military term meaning "ten
pounds of manure in a five-pound bag"] n. 1. An intractable problem. 2. A
crucial piece of hardware which can't be fixed or replaced if it breaks. 3. A
tool that has been hacked over by so many incompetent programmers that it has
become an unmaintainable tissue of hacks. 4. An out-of-control but unkillable
development effort. 5. An embaressing bug that pops up during a customer
demo. This term has other meanings in other technical cultures; in
particular, among experimental physicists and hardware engineers of various
kinds it seems to mean any random object of unknown purpose (similar to
hackish use of {frob}). It has also been used to describe an amusing
trick-the-eye drawing resembling a three-pronged fork which appears to depict
a three-dimensional object until one realizes that the parts fit together in
an impossible way. block: [from process scheduling terminology in OS theory]
1. vi. To delay or sit idle while waiting for something. "We're blocking
until everyone gets here." Compare {busy-wait}. 2. `block on' vt. To block,
waiting for (something). "Lunch is blocked on Phil's arrival." block transfer
computations: n. From the Dr. Who television series: in the show, it referred
to computations so fiendishly subtle and complex that they could not be
performed by machines. Used to refer to any task that should be expressible
as an algorithm in theory, but isn't. blow an EPROM: v. To program a
read-only memory, e.g. for use with an embedded system. This term arises
because the programming process for the Programmable Read-Only Memories
(PROMs) that preceded present-day Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memories
(EPROMs) involved intentionally blowing tiny electrical fuses on the chip.
Thus, one was said to "blow a PROM" and the terminology carried over even
though the write process on EPROMs is nondestructive. blow away: vt. To
remove files and directories from permanent storage with extreme prejudice,
generally by accident. Oppose {nuke}. blow out: vi. Of software, to fail
spectacularly; almost as serious as {crash and burn}. see {blow past}. blow
past: vt. To {blow out} despite a safeguard. "The server blew past the 5K
reserve buffer." blow up: vi. [scientific computation] To become unstable.
Suggests that the computation is diverging so rapidly that it will soon
overflow or at least go {nonlinear}.
