 :BITNET: /bit'net/ [acronym: Because It's Time NETwork] n. Everybody's least
favorite piece of the network (see {network, the}). The BITNET hosts are a
collection of IBM dinosaurs and VAXen (the latter with lobotomized comm
hardware) that communicate using 80-character {{EBCDIC}} card images (see
{eighty-column mind}); thus, they tend to mangle the headers and text of
third-party traffic from the rest of the ASCII/{RFC}-822 world with annoying
regularity. BITNET is also notorious as the apparent home of {BIFF}.
