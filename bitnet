 :BITNET: /bit'net/ n., obs. [acronym: Because It's Time NETwork] Everybody's
least favorite piece of the network (see {the network}) - until AOL happened.
The BITNET hosts were a collection of IBM dinosaurs and VAXen (the latter
with lobotomized comm hardware) that communicated using 80-character
{{EBCDIC}} card images (see {eighty-column mind}); thus, they tended to
mangle the headers and text of third-party traffic from the rest of the
ASCII/{RFC}-822 world with annoying regularity. BITNET was also notorious as
the apparent home of {B1FF}. By 1995 it had, much to everyone's relief, been
obsolesced and absorbed into the Internet. Unfortunately, around this time we
also got AOL.
