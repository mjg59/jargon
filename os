 OS/2 (oh ess too) n. The anointed successor to MS-DOS for Intel-286 and
(allegedly) 386-based micros; proof that IBM/Microsoft couldn't get it right
the second time, either. Cited here because mentioning it is always good for
a cheap laugh among hackers -- the design was so bad that three years after
introduction you could still count the major APPs shipping for it on the
fingers of two hands. see VAPORWARE, MONSTROSITY, CRETINOUS, SECOND-SYSTEM
SYNDROME.
