 IBM PC is a WAITS legacy. One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was
a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter
AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also featured a
still-unusual level of support for what is now called `multimedia' computing,
allowing analog audio and video signals to be switched to programming
terminals. :waldo: /wol'doh/ n. [From Robert A. Heinlein's story "Waldo"] 1.
A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm, controlled by a human limb. When
these were developed for the nuclear industry in the mid-1940s they were
named after the invention described by Heinlein in the story, which he wrote
in 1942. Now known by the more generic term `telefactoring', this technology
is of intense interest to NASA for tasks like space station maintenance. 2.
At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham and students), this is used instead
of {foobar} as a metasyntactic variable and general nonsense word. see {foo},
{bar}, {foobar}, {quux}. :walk: n.,vt. Traversal of a data structure,
especially an array or linked-list data structure in {core}. see also
{codewalker}, {silly walk}, {clobber}. :walk off the end of: vt. To run past
the end of an array, list, or medium after stepping through it -- a good way
to land in trouble. Often the result of an {off-by-one error}. Compare
{clobber}, {roach}, {smash the stack}. :walking drives: n. An occasional
failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back in the days when they were huge,
clunky {washing machine}s. Those old {dinosaur} parts carried terrific
angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to `walk' across
a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple of millimeters at a time.
There is a legend about a drive that walked over to the only door to the
computer room and jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in
order to get at it! Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of
drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk, followed by a
slow seek in the other direction). Some bands of old-time hackers figured out
how to induce disk-accessing patterns that would do this to particular drive
models and held disk-drive races. :wall: interj. [WPI] 1. An indication of
confusion, usually spoken with a quizzical tone: "Wall??" 2. A request for
further explication. Compare {octal forty}. 3. [Unix, from `write all'] v. To
send a message to everyone currently logged in, esp. with the wall(8)
utility. It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom `like talking to a blank
wall'. It was originally used in situations where, after you had carefully
answered a question, the questioner stared at you blankly, clearly having
understood nothing that was explained. You would then throw out a "Hello,
wall?" to elicit some sort of response from the questioner. Later, confused
questioners began voicing "Wall?" themselves. :wall follower: n. A person or
algorithm that compensates for lack of sophistication or native stupidity by
efficiently following some simple procedure shown to have been effective in
the past. Used of an algorithm, this is not necessarily pejorative; it
recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the winning robot in an early AI contest (named,
of course, after the cocktail). Harvey successfully solved mazes by keeping a
`finger' on one wall and running till it came out the other end. This was
inelegant, but it was mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected
mazes -- and, in fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that
tried to `learn' each maze by building an internal representation of it. Used
of humans, the term _is_ pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic,
by-the-book mentality. see also {code grinder}; compare {droid}. :wall time:
n. (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world' time (what the clock on the wall
shows), as opposed to the system clock's idea of time. 2. The real running
time of a program, as opposed to the number of {tick}s required to execute it
(on a timesharing system these always differ, as no one program gets all the
ticks, and on multiprocessor systems with good thread support one may get
more processor time than real time). :wall wart: n. A small power-supply
brick with integral male plug, designed to plug directly into a wall outlet.
These are frequently associated with modems and other small electronic
devices which would become unacceptably bulky or hot if they had power
supplies on board (there are other reasons as well having to do with the cost
of UL certification). :wallpaper: n. 1. A file containing a listing (e.g.,
assembly listing) or a transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of all
or part of a login session. (The idea was that the paper for such listings
was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced at Stanford, where it
was used to cover windows.) Now rare, esp. since other systems have developed
other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). However, the Unix world doesn't
have an equivalent term, so perhaps {wallpaper} will take hold there. The
term probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end
transcript files were `:WALBEG' and `:WALEND', with default file `WALL PAPER'
(the space was a path delimiter). 2. The background pattern used on graphical
workstations (this is techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface
to MS-DOS). 3. `wallpaper file' n. The file that contains the wallpaper
information before it is actually printed on paper. (Even if you don't intend
ever to produce a real paper copy of the file, it is still called a wallpaper
file.) :wango: /wang'goh/ n. Random bit-level {grovel}ling going on in a
system during some unspecified operation. Often used in combination with
{mumble}. For example: "You start with the `.o' file, run it through this
postprocessor that does mumble-wango -- and it comes out a snazzy
object-oriented executable." :wank: /wangk/ n.,v.,adj. [Columbia University:
prob. by mutation from Commonwealth slang v. `wank', to masturbate] Used much
as {hack} is elsewhere, as a noun denoting a clever technique or person or
the result of such cleverness. May describe (negatively) the act of hacking
for hacking's sake ("Quit wanking, let's go get supper!") or (more
positively) a {wizard}. Adj. `wanky' describes something particularly clever
(a person, program, or algorithm). Conversations can also get wanky when
there are too many wanks involved. This excess wankiness is signalled by an
overload of the `wankometer' (compare {bogometer}). When the wankometer
overloads, the conversation's subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will
leave. Compare `neep-neeping' (under {neep-neep}). Usage: U.S. only. In
Britain and the Commonwealth this word is _extremely_ rude and is best
avoided unless one intends to give offense. :wannabee: /won'*-bee/ n. (also,
more plausibly, spelled `wannabe') [from a term recently used to describe
Madonna fans who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob. originally from
biker slang] A would-be {hacker}. The connotations of this term differ
sharply depending on the age and exposure of the subject. Used of a person
who is in or might be entering {larval stage}, it is semi-approving; such
wannabees can be annoying but most hackers remember that they, too, were once
such creatures. When used of any professional programmer, CS academic,
writer, or {suit}, it is derogatory, implying that said person is trying to
cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a prayer of
understanding what it is all about. Overuse of terms from this lexicon is
often an indication of the {wannabee} nature. Compare {newbie}. Historical
note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different flavor now (1993) than
it did ten or fifteen years ago. When the people who are now hackerdom's
tribal elders were in {larval stage}, the process of becoming a hacker was
largely unconscious and unaffected by models known in popular culture --
communities formed spontaneously around people who, _as individuals_, felt
irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees experienced was
a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become similarly wizardly. Those days
of innocence are gone forever; society's adaptation to the advent of the
microcomputer after 1980 included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind
of folk hero, and the result is that some people semi-consciously set out to
_be hackers_ and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image of
hackers. Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually become a
wizard. Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly articulated
disquiet about the change; among other things, it gives them mixed feelings
about the effects of public compendia of lore like this one. :war dialer: n.
A cracking tool, a program that calls a given list or range of phone numbers
and records those which answer with handshake tones (and so might be entry
points to computer or telecommunications systems). Some of these programs
have become quite sophisticated, and can now detect modem, fax, or PBX tones
and log each one separately. The war dialer is one of the most important
tools in the {phreaker}'s kit. These programs evolved from early {demon
dialer}s. :warez: /weirz/ n. Widely used in {cracker} subcultures to denote
cracked version of commercial software, that is versions from which
copy-protection has been stripped. Hackers recognize this term but don't use
it themselves. see {warez d00dz}. :warez d00dz: /weirz doodz/ n. A
substantial subculture of {cracker}s refer to themselves as `warez d00dz';
there is evidently some connection with {B1FF} here. As `Ozone Pilot', one
former warez d00d, wrote: Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted
software. If it has copy protection on it, they break the protection so the
software can be copied. Then they distribute it around the world via several
gateways. Warez d00dz form badass group names like RAZOR and the like. They
put up boards that distribute the latest ware, or pirate program. The whole
point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the pirate program released and
distributed before any other group. I know, I know. But don't ask, and it
won't hurt as much. This is how they prove their poweress [sic]. It gives
them the right to say, "I released King's Quest IVXIX before you so obviously
my testicles are larger." Again don't ask... The studly thing to do if one is
a warez d00d, it appears, is emit `0-day warez', that is copies of commercial
software copied and cracked on the same day as its retail release. Warez
d00ds also hoard software in a big way, collecting untold megabytes of
arcade-style games, pornographic GIFs, and applications they'll never use
onto their hard disks. As Ozone Pilot acutely observes: [BELONG] is the only
word you will need to know. Warez d00dz want to belong. They have been
shunned by everyone, and thus turn to cyberspace for acceptance. That is why
they always start groups like TGW, FLT, USA and the like. Structure makes
them happy. [...] Warez d00dz will never have a handle like "Pink Daisy"
because warez d00dz are insecure. Only someone who is very secure with a good
dose of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man. More
likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death, Deranged
Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown, Renegade Chemist,
Terminator, and Twin Turbo. They like to sound badass when they can hide
behind their terminals. More likely, if you were given a sample of 100
people, the person whose handle is Hellraiser is the last person you'd
associate with the name. The contrast with Internet hackers is stark and
instructive. see {cracker}, {wannabee}, {handle}, {elite}; compare {weenie},
{spod}. :warez kiddies: n. Even more derogatory way of referring to {warez
d00dz}; refers to the fact that most warez d00dz are around the age of
puberty. Compare {script kiddies}. :warlording: v. [from the Usenet group
alt.fan.warlord] The act of excoriating a bloated, ugly, or derivative {sig
block}. Common grounds for warlording include the presence of a signature
rendered in a {BUAF}, over-used or cliched {sig quote}s, ugly {ASCII art}, or
simply excessive size. The original `Warlord' was a {B1FF}-like {newbie}
c.1991 who featured in his sig a particularly large and obnoxious ASCII
graphic resembling the sword of Conan the Barbarian in the 1981 John Milius
movie; the group name alt.fan.warlord was sarcasm, and the characteristic
mode of warlording is devastatingly sarcastic praise. :warm boot: n. see
{boot}. :wart: n. A small, {crock}y {feature} that sticks out of an otherwise
{clean} design. Something conspicuous for localized ugliness, especially a
special-case exception to a general rule. For example, in some versions of
`csh(1)', single quotes literalize every character inside them except `!'. In
ANSI C, the `??' syntax used for obtaining ASCII characters in a foreign
environment is a wart. see also {miswart}. :washing machine: n. 1. Old-style
14-inch hard disks in floor-standing cabinets. So called because of the size
of the cabinet and the `top-loading' access to the media packs -- and, of
course, they were always set on `spin cycle'. The washing-machine idiom
transcends language barriers; it is even used in Russian hacker jargon. see
also {walking drives}. The thick channel cables connecting these were called
`bit hoses' (see {hose}, sense 3). 2. [CMU] A machine used exclusively for
{washing software}. CMU has clusters of these. :washing software: n. The
process of recompiling a software distribution (used more often when the
recompilation is occuring from scratch) to pick up and merge together all of
the various changes that have been made to the source. :water MIPS: n. (see
{MIPS}, sense 2) Large, water-cooled machines of either today's
ECL-supercomputer flavor or yesterday's traditional {mainframe} type. :wave a
dead chicken: v. To perform a ritual in the direction of crashed software or
hardware that one believes to be futile but is nevertheless necessary so that
others are satisfied that an appropriate degree of effort has been expended.
"I'll wave a dead chicken over the source code, but I really think we've run
into an OS bug." Compare {voodoo programming}, {rain dance}; see also
{casting the runes}. :weasel: n. [Cambridge] A naive user, one who
deliberately or accidentally does things that are stupid or ill-advised.
Roughly synonymous with {loser}. :web pointer: n. A World Wide Web {URL}. see
also {hotlink}, which has slightly different connotations. :web toaster: n. A
small specialized computer, shipped with no monitor or keyboard or any other
external peripherals, pre-configured to be controlled through an Ethernet
port and function as a WWW server. Products of this kind (for example the
Cobalt Qube) are often about the size of a toaster. see {toaster}; compare
{video toaster}. :webify: n. [MIT] To put a piece of (possibly already
existing) material on the WWW. Frequently used for papers ("Why don't you
webify all your publications?") or for demos ("They webified their
