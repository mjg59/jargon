 :OS and JEDGAR: =============== This story says a lot about the ITS ethos.
On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was being
printed on someone else's terminal. It spied on the other guy's output by
examining the insides of the monitor system. The output spy program was
called OS. Throughout the rest of the computer science world (and at IBM too)
OS means `operating system', but among old-time ITS hackers it almost always
meant `output spy'. OS could work because ITS purposely had very little in
the way of `protection' that prevented one user from trespassing on another's
areas. Fair is fair, however. There was another program that would
automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output. It worked
in exactly the same way, by looking at the insides of the operating system to
see if anyone else was looking at the insides that had to do with your
output. This `counterspy' program was called JEDGAR (a six-letterism
pronounced as two syllables: /jed'gr/), in honor of the former head of the
FBI. But there's more. JEDGAR would ask the user for `license to kill'. If
the user said yes, then JEDGAR would actually {gun} the job of the {luser}
who was spying. Unfortunately, people found that this made life too violent,
especially when tourists learned about it. One of the systems hackers solved
the problem by replacing JEDGAR with another program that only pretended to
do its job. It took a long time to do this, because every copy of JEDGAR had
to be patched. To this day no one knows how many people never figured out
that JEDGAR had been defanged. Interestingly, there is still a security
module named JEDGAR alive as of late 1999 -- in the Unisys MCP for large
systems. It is unknown to us whether the name is tribute or independent
invention.
