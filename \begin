 :\begin: // [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used humorously in writing
to indicate a context or to remark on the surrounded text. For example:
\begin{flame} Predicate logic is the only good programming language. Anyone
who would use anything else is an idiot. Also, all computers should be
tredecimal instead of binary. \end{flame} The Scribe users at CMU and
elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in an identical way (LaTeX was built to
resemble Scribe). On Usenet, this construct would more frequently be rendered
as `<FLAME ON>' and `<FLAME OFF>', or `#ifdef FLAME' and `#endif FLAME".
