 :SPACEWAR: n. A space-combat simulation game, inspired by E. E. "Doc"
Smith's "Lensman" books, in which two spaceships duel around a central sun,
shooting torpedoes at each other and jumping through hyperspace. This game
was first implemented on the PDP-1 at MIT in 1962. In 1968-69, a descendant
of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build, in his spare time on a scavenged
PDP-7, the operating system that became {{Unix}}. Less than nine years after
that, SPACEWAR was commercialized as one of the first video games;
descendants are still {feep}ing in video arcades everywhere.
