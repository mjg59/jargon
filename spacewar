 SPACEWAR (spays'wohr) n. A space-combat simulation game first implemented on
the PDP-1 at MIT in 1960-61. SPACEWAR aficionados formed the core of the
early hacker culture at MIT. Ten years later a descendent of the game
motivated Ken Thompson to invent UNIX (q.v.). Ten years after that, SPACEWAR
was commercialized as one of the first video games; descendants are still
feeping in video arcades everywhere.
