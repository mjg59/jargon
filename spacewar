 1962. In 1968-69, a descendant of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build,
in his spare time on a scavenged PDP-7, the operating system that became
{{Unix}}. Less than nine years after that, SPACEWAR was commercialized as one
of the first video games; descendants are still {feep}ing in video arcades
everywhere. :spaghetti code: n. Code with a complex and tangled control
structure, esp. one using many GOTOs, exceptions, or other `unstructured'
branching constructs. Pejorative. The synonym `kangaroo code' has been
reported, doubtless because such code has so many jumps in it. :spaghetti
inheritance: n. [encountered among users of object-oriented languages that
use inheritance, such as Smalltalk] A convoluted class-subclass graph, often
resulting from carelessly deriving subclasses from other classes just for the
sake of reusing their code. Coined in a (successful) attempt to discourage
such practice, through guilt-by-association with {spaghetti code}. :spam:
vt.,vi.,n. [from "Monty Python's Flying Circus"] 1. To crash a program by
overrunning a fixed-size buffer with excessively large input data. see also
{buffer overflow}, {overrun screw}, {smash the stack}. 2. To cause a
newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or inappropriate messages. You can
spam a newsgroup with as little as one well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g.
asking "What do you think of abortion?" on soc.women). This is often done
with {cross-post}ing (e.g. any message which is crossposted to
alt.rush-limbaugh and alt.politics.homosexuality will almost inevitably spam
both groups). This overlaps with {troll} behavior; the latter more specific
term has become more common. 3. To send many identical or nearly-identical
messages separately to a large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more
specifically called `ECP', Excessive Cross-Posting. This is one sure way to
infuriate nearly everyone on the Net. see also {velveeta} and {jello}. 4. To
bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message. This is more
specifically called `EMP', Excessive Multi-Posting. 5. To mass-mail
unrequested identical or nearly-identical email messages, particularly those
containing advertising. Especially used when the mail addresses have been
culled from network traffic or databases without the consent of the
recipients. Synonyms include {UCE}, {UBE}. 6. Any large, annoying, quantity
of output. For instance, someone on IRC who walks away from their screen and
comes back to find 200 lines of text might say "Oh no, spam". The later
definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet has opened up to
non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are now primary. All three
behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and are almost universally grounds
for termination of the originator's email account or network connection. In
these senses the term `spam' has gone mainstream, though without its original
sense or folkloric freight - there is apparently a widespread myth among
{luser}s that "spamming" is what happens when you dump cans of Spam into a
revolving fan. :spamblock: /spam'blok/ n. [poss. by analogy to sunblock] Text
inserted in an email address to render it invalid and thus useless to
spammers. For example, the address `jrandom@hacker.org' might be transformed
to `jrandom@NOSPAM.hacker.org'. Adding spamblock to an address is often
referred to as `munging' it (see {munge})-. This evasion tactic depends on
the fact that most spammers collect names with some sort of {address
harvester} on volumes too high to de-mung by hand, but individual humans
reading an email message can readily spot and remove a spamblock in the from
address. Note: This is not actually a very effective tactic, and may already
be passing out of use in early 1999 after about two years of life. In both
mail and news, it's essentially impossible to keep a smart address harvester
from mining out the addresses in the message header and trace lines.
Therefore the only people who can be protected are third parties mentioned by
email address in the message - not a common enough case to interest spammers.
:spamhaus: spam'hows n. Pejorative term for an internet service provider that
permits or even encourages {spam} mailings from its systems. The plural is
`spamhausen'. There is a web page devoted to tracking spamhausen
(http://combat.uxn.com/spamhaus.html). The most notorious of the spamhausen
was Sanford Wallace's Cyber Promotions Inc., shut down by a lawsuit on 16
October 1997. The anniversary of the shutdown is celebrated on Usenet as Spam
Freedom Day, but lesser imitators of the Spamford still infest various murky
corners of the net. Since prosecution of spammers became routine under the
junk-fax laws and statues specifically targeting spam, spamhausen have
declined in relative importance; today, hit-and-run attacks by spammers using
{relay rape} and {throwaway account}s on reputable ISPs seem to account for
most of the flow. :spamvertize: v. To advertise using {spam}. Pejorative.
:spangle: n. [UK] The singular of {bells and whistles}. see also {spungle}.
:spawn: n.,vi. 1. [techspeak] In UNIX parlance, to create a child process
from within a process. Technically this is a `fork'; the term `spawn' is a
bit more general and is used for threads (lightweight processes) as well as
traditional heavyweight processes. 2. In gaming, meant to indicate where
(`spawn-point') and when a player comes to life (or `re-spawns') after being
killed. Opposite of {frag}. :special-case: vt. To write unique code to handle
input to or situations arising in a program that are somehow distinguished
from normal processing. This would be used for processing of mode switches or
interrupt characters in an interactive interface (as opposed, say, to text
entry or normal commands), or for processing of {hidden flag}s in the input
of a batch program or {filter}. :speedometer: n. A pattern of lights
displayed on a linear set of LEDs (today) or nixie tubes (yesterday, on
ancient mainframes). The pattern is shifted left every N times the operating
system goes through its {main loop}. A swiftly moving pattern indicates that
the system is mostly idle; the speedometer slows down as the system becomes
overloaded. The speedometer on Sun Microsystems hardware bounces back and
forth like the eyes on one of the Cylons from the wretched "Battlestar
Galactica" TV series. Historical note: One computer, the GE 600 (later
Honeywell 6000) actually had an _analog_ speedometer on the front panel,
calibrated in instructions executed per second. :spell: n. Syn.
{incantation}. :spelling flame: n. // [Usenet] A posting ostentatiously
correcting a previous article's spelling as a way of casting scorn on the
point the article was trying to make, instead of actually responding to that
point (compare {dictionary flame}). Of course, people who are more than
usually slovenly spellers are prone to think _any_ correction is a spelling
flame. It's an amusing comment on human nature that spelling flames
themselves often contain spelling errors. :spider food: n. Keywords embedded
(usually invisibly) into a web page to attract search engines (spiders). The
intended result of including spider food in one's web page is to insure that
the page appears high on the list of matching entries to a search engine
query. There are right and wrong ways to do this; the right way is a discreet
`meta keywords' tag, the wrong way is to embed many repeats of a keyword in
comments (and many search engines now detect and ignore the latter). :spiffy:
/spi'fee/ adj. 1. Said of programs having a pretty, clever, or exceptionally
well-designed interface. "Have you seen the spiffy {X} version of {empire}
yet?" 2. Said sarcastically of a program that is perceived to have little
more than a flashy interface going for it. Which meaning should be drawn
depends delicately on tone of voice and context. This word was common
mainstream slang during the 1940s, in a sense close to 1. :spike: v. To
defeat a selection mechanism by introducing a (sometimes temporary) device
that forces a specific result. The word is used in several industries;
telephone engineers refer to spiking a relay by inserting a pin to hold the
relay in either the closed or open state, and railroaders refer to spiking a
track switch so that it cannot be moved. In programming environments it
normally refers to a temporary change, usually for testing purposes (as
opposed to a permanent change, which would be called {hardwired}). :spin: vi.
Equivalent to {buzz}. More common among C and Unix programmers. :spl: /S-P-L/
[abbrev, from Set Priority Level] The way traditional Unix kernels implement
mutual exclusion by running code at high interrupt levels. Used in jargon to
describe the act of tuning in or tuning out ordinary communication.
Classically, spl levels run from 1 to 7; "Fred's at spl 6 today" would mean
that he is very hard to interrupt. "Wait till I finish this; I'll spl down
then." see also {interrupts locked out}. :splash screen: n. [Mac users] Syn.
{banner}, sense 3. :splat: n. 1. Name used in many places (DEC, IBM, and
others) for the asterisk (`*') character (ASCII 0101010). This may derive
from the `squashed-bug' appearance of the asterisk on many early line
printers. 2. [MIT] Name used by some people for the `#' character (ASCII
0100011). 3. The {feature key} on a Mac (same as {alt}, sense 2). 4. obs.
Name used by some people for the Stanford/ITS extended ASCII circle-x
character. This character is also called `blobby' and `frob', among other
names; it is sometimes used by mathematicians as a notation for `tensor
product'.
