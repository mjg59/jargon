 :SPACEWAR: n. A space-combat simulation game, inspired by E. E. "Doc"
Smith's "Lensman" books, in which two spaceships duel around a central sun,
shooting torpedoes at each other and jumping through hyperspace. This game
was first implemented on the PDP-1 at MIT in 1960--61. SPACEWAR aficionados
formed the core of the early hacker culture at MIT. Nine years later, a
descendant of the game motivated Ken Thompson to build, in his spare time on
a scavenged PDP-7, the operating system that became {{UNIX}}. Less than nine
years after that, SPACEWAR was commercialized as one of the first video
games; descendants are still {feep}ing in video arcades everywhere.
