 :software laser: /n./ An optical laser works by bouncing photons back and
forth between two mirrors, one totally reflective and one partially
reflective. If the lasing material (usually a crystal) has the right
properties, photons scattering off the atoms in the crystal will excite
cascades of more photons, all in lockstep. Eventually the beam will escape
through the partially-reflective mirror. One kind of {sorcerer's apprentice
mode} involving {bounce message}s can produce closely analogous results, with
a {cascade} of messages escaping to flood nearby systems. By mid-1993 there
had been at least two publicized incidents of this kind.
