 CATATONIA n. A condition of suspended animation in which something is so
WEDGED that it makes no response. For example, if you are typing on a
terminal and suddenly the computer doesn't even echo the letters back to the
screen as you type, let alone do what you're asking it to do, then the
computer is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has CRASHED).
