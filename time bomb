 :time bomb: n. A subspecies of {logic bomb} that is triggered by reaching
some preset time, either once or periodically. There are numerous legends
about time bombs set up by programmers in their employers' machines, to go
off if the programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to perform the
appropriate suppressing action periodically. [I have been unable to verify
that any of these legends are true, and they have all the characteristics of
urban folklore --- ESR]
