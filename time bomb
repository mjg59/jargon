 :time bomb: /n./ A subspecies of {logic bomb} that is triggered by reaching
some preset time, either once or periodically. There are numerous legends
about time bombs set up by programmers in their employers' machines, to go
off if the programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to perform the
appropriate suppressing action periodically. Interestingly, the only such
incident for which we have been pointed to documentary evidence took place in
the Soviet Union in 1986! A disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile
Plant (where the Fiat clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a time
bomb which, a week after he'd left on vacation, stopped the entire main
assembly line for a day. The case attracted lots of attention in the Soviet
Union because it was the first cracking case to make it to court there. The
perpetrator got a suspended sentence of 3 years in jail and was barred from
future work as a programmer.
