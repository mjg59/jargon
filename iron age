 :Iron Age: n. In the history of computing, 1961--1971 -- the formative era
of commercial {mainframe} technology, when ferrite-core {dinosaur}s ruled the

minicomputer (the PDP-1) and ended with the introduction of the first
commercial microprocessor (the Intel 4004) in 1971. see also {Stone Age};
compare {elder days}.
