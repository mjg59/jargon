 :bitblt: /bit'blit/ n. [from {BLT}, q.v.] 1. Any of a family of closely
related algorithms for moving and copying rectangles of bits between main and
display memory on a bit-mapped device, or between two areas of either main or
display memory (the requirement to do the {Right Thing} in the case of
overlapping source and destination rectangles is what makes BitBlt tricky).
2. Synonym for {blit} or {BLT}. Both uses are borderline techspeak.
