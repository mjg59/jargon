 BITBLT /bit'blit/ or /bit'belt/ n. [from BLT, q.v.] 1. Any of a closely
related family of algorithms for moving and copying rectangles of bits
between main and display memory on a bit-mapped device, or between two areas
of either main or display memory (the requirement to do the right thing in
the case of overlapping source and destination rectangles is what makes
BitBlt tricky). 2. Synonym for BLIT or BLT (q.v.)
