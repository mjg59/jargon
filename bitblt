 BITBLT (bit'blit, bit'belt) n. [from BLT, q.v.] 1. One of a closely related
family of algorithms for moving and copying rectangles of bits between main
and display memory on a bit-mapped device, or between two areas of either
main or display memory (the requirement to do the right thing in the case of
overlapping source and destination rectangles is what makes BitBlt tricky).
2. An early experimental bit-mapped terminal at Bell Labs, later
commercialized as the AT&T 5620.
