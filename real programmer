 REAL PROGRAMMER [indirectly, from the book "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"] n. A
particular sub-variety of hacker, one possessed of a flippant attitude
towards complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The
archetypal `real programmer' likes to program on the BARE METAL, and is very
good at same; he remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he's every
programmed and thinks that HLLs are for wimps. Real Programmers aren't
satisfied with code that hasn't been BUMmed into a state of TENSEness just
short of rupture. Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation;
"If it was hard to write", says the Real Programmer, "it should be hard to
understand." Real Programmers can make machines do things that were never in
their spec sheets; in fact, they're seldom really happy unless doing so. A
Real Programmer's code can awe you with its fiendish brilliance even as it
appalls by its level of CROCKISHNESS. Real Programmers live on junk food and
coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap out of
other programmers --- because someday, somebody else might have to try to
understand their code in order to change it. Their successors generally
consider it a GOOD THING that there aren't many Real Programmers around any
more.
