 :frogging: [University of Waterloo] v. 1. Partial corruption of a text file
or input stream by some bug or consistent glitch, as opposed to random events
like line noise or media failures. Might occur, for example, if one bit of
each incoming character on a tty were stuck, so that some characters were
correct and others were not. see {terminak} for a historical example. 2. By
extension, accidental display of text in a mode where the output device emits
special symbols or mnemonics rather than conventional ASCII. This often
happens, for example, when using a terminal or comm program on a device like
an IBM PC with a special `high-half' character set and with the bit-parity
assumption wrong. A hacker sufficiently familiar with ASCII bit patterns
might be able to read the display anyway.
