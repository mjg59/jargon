 :mudhead: n. Commonly used to refer to a {MUD} player who eats, sleeps, and
breathes MUD. Mudheads have been known to fail their degrees, drop out, etc.,
with the consolation, however, that they made wizard level. When encountered
in person, on a MUD, or in a chat system, all a mudhead will talk about is
three topics: the tactic, character, or wizard that is supposedly always
unfairly stopping him/her from becoming a wizard or beating a favorite MUD;
why the specific game he/she has experience with is so much better than any
other; and the MUD he or she is writing or going to write because his/her
design ideas are so much better than in any existing MUD. see also
{wannabee}. To the anthropologically literate, this term may recall the
Zuni/Hopi legend of the mudheads or `koyemshi', mythical half-formed children
of an unnatural union. Figures representing them act as clowns in Zuni sacred
ceremonies.
