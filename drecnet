 :DRECNET: /drek'net/ n. [from Yiddish/German `dreck', meaning filth]
Deliberate distortion of DECNET, a networking protocol used in the {VMS}
community. So called because {DEC} helped write the Ethernet specification
and then (either stupidly or as a malignant customer-control tactic) violated
that spec in the design of DRECNET in a way that made it incompatible. see
also {connector conspiracy}.
