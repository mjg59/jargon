 DRECNET (drek'net) [fr. Yiddish `dreck'] n. Deliberate distortion of DECNET,
a networking protocol used in the VMS community. So-called because DEC helped
write the Ethernet specification, and then (either stupidly or as a malignant
customer-control tactic) violated that spec in the design of DRECNET (among
other things, they implemented the wrong HEARTBEAT speed).
