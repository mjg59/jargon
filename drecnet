 DRECNET: /drek'net/ [from German & Yiddish `dreck'] n. Deliberate distortion
of DECNET, a networking protocol used in the {VMS} community. So-called
because DEC helped write the Ethernet specification, and then (either
stupidly or as a malignant customer-control tactic) violated that spec in the
design of DRECNET in a way that made it incompatible. see also {connector
conspiracy}. driver: n. 1. The {main loop} of an event-processing program;
the code that gets commands and dispatches them for execution. 2. In `device
driver', code designed to handle a particular peripheral device such as a
magnetic disk or tape. drool-proof paper: n. Documentation which has been
obsessively dumbed down, to the point where only a {cretin} could bear to
read it, is said to have succumbed to the `drool-proof paper syndrome' or to
have been `written on drool-proof paper'. For example, this is an actual
quote from Apple's LaserWriter manual: "Do not expose your LaserWriter to
open fire or flame." drop on the floor: vt. To react to an error condition by
silently discarding messages or other valuable data. Example: "The gateway
ran out of memory, so it just started dropping packets on the floor." Also
frequently used of faulty mail and netnews relay sites that lose messages.
see also {black hole}, {bit bucket}. drop-ins: [prob. by anology with
{drop-outs}] n. Spurious characters appearing on a terminal or console due to
line noise or a system malfunction of some sort. Esp. used when these are
interspersed with your own typed input. Compare {drop-outs}. drop-outs: n. 1.
A variety of `power glitch' (see {glitch}); momentary zero voltage on the
electrical mains. 2. Missing characters in typed input due to software
malfunction or system saturation (this can happen under UNIX, for example,
when a bad connect to a modem swamps the processor with spurious character
interrupts). 3. Mental glitches; used as a way of describing those occasions
when the mind just seems to shut down for a couple of beats. see {glitch},
{fried}. drugged: adj., also `on drugs'. 1. Conspicuously stupid, heading
towards {brain-damaged}. Often accompanied by a pantomime of toking a joint
(but see Appendix B). 2. Of hardware, very slow relative to normal
performance. drunk mouse syndrome: n. A malady exhibited by the mouse
pointing device of some computers. The typical symptom is for the mouse
cursor on the screen to move to random directions and not in sync with the
moving of the actual mouse. Can usually be corrected by unplugging the mouse
and plugging it back again. Another recommended fix is to rotate your optical
mouse pad 90 degrees. dumbass attack: /duhm'ass @-tak'/ [Purdue] n. Notional
cause of a novice's mistake made by the experienced, especially one made
while running as root under UNIX, e.g. typing `rm -r *' or `mkfs' on a
mounted file system. Compare {adger}. dump: n. 1. An undigested and
voluminous mass of information about a problem or the state of a system,
especially one routed to the slowest available output device (compare {core
dump}), and most especially one consisting or hex and octal {runes}
describing the byte-by-byte state of memory, mass storage, or some file. In
elder days, debugging was generally done by `grovelling over a dump' (see
{grovel}); increasing use of high-level languages and interactive debuggers
has made this uncommon, and the term `dump' now has a faintly archaic flavor.
2. A backup. This usage is typical only at large timesharing installations.
dup killer: /d[y]oop killer/ [FidoNet] n. Software which is supposed to
detect and delete duplicates of a message which may have reached the FidoNet
system via different routes. dup loop: /d[y]oop loop/ (also `dupe loop')
[FidoNet] n. An incorrectly configured system or network gateway may
propagate duplicate messages on one or more {echo}s, with different
identification information which renders {dup killer}s ineffective. If such a
duplicate message eventually reaches a system which it has already passed
through (with the original identification information), all systems passed on
the way back to that system are said to be involved in a {dup loop}. dusty
deck: n. Old software (especially applications) with which one is obliged to
remain compatible (or to maintain). The term implies that the software in
question is a holdover from card-punch days. Used esp. when referring to old
scientific and number-crunching software, much of which was written in
FORTRAN and very poorly documented but is believed to be too expensive to
replace. see {fossil}.
