 :Stupids: /n./ Term used by {samurai} for the {suit}s who employ them;
succinctly expresses an attitude at least as common, though usually better
disguised, among other subcultures of hackers. There may be intended
reference here to an SF story originally published in 1952 but much
anthologized since, Mark Clifton's "Star, Bright". In it, a super-genius
child classifies humans into a very few `Brights' like herself, a huge
majority of `Stupids', and a minority of `Tweens', the merely ordinary
geniuses.
