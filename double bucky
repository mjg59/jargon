 :double bucky: adj. Using both the CTRL and META keys. "The command to burn
all LEDs is double bucky F." This term originated on the Stanford
extended-ASCII keyboard, and was later taken up by users of the {space-cadet
keyboard} at MIT. A typical MIT comment was that the Stanford {bucky bits}
(control and meta shifting keys) were nice, but there weren't enough of them;
you could type only 512 different characters on a Stanford keyboard. An
obvious way to address this was simply to add more shifting keys, and this
was eventually done; but a keyboard with that many shifting keys is hard on
touch-typists, who don't like to move their hands away from the home position
on the keyboard. It was half-seriously suggested that the extra shifting keys
be implemented as pedals; typing on such a keyboard would be very much like
playing a full pipe organ. This idea is mentioned in a parody of a very fine
song by Jeffrey Moss called "Rubber Duckie", which was published in "The
Sesame Street Songbook" (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN 0-671-21036-X). These
lyrics were written on May 27, 1978, in celebration of the Stanford keyboard:
Double Bucky Double bucky, you're the one! You make my keyboard lots of fun.
Double bucky, an additional bit or two: (Vo-vo-de-o!) Control and meta, side
by side, Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide! Double bucky! Half a thousand
glyphs, plus a few! Oh, I sure wish that I Had a couple of Bits more! Perhaps
a Set of pedals to Make the number of Bits four: Double double bucky! Double
bucky, left and right OR'd together, outta sight! Double bucky, I'd like a
whole word of Double bucky, I'm happy I heard of Double bucky, I'd like a
whole word of you! --- The Great Quux (with apologies to Jeffrey Moss) [This,
by the way, is an excellent example of computer {filk} --ESR] see also {meta
bit}, {cokebottle}, and {quadruple bucky}.
