 :tune: vt. [from automotive or musical usage] To optimize a program or
system for a particular environment, esp. by adjusting numerical parameters
designed as {hook}s for tuning, e.g., by changing `#define' lines in C. One
may `tune for time' (fastest execution), `tune for space' (least memory use),
or `tune for configuration' (most efficient use of hardware). see {bum}, {hot
spot}, {hand-hacking}.
