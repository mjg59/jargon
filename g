 :G: pref.,suff. 1. [SI] see {quantifiers}. 2. The letter G has special
significance in the hacker community, largely thanks to the GNU project and
the GPL. Many {free software} projects have names that names that begin with
G. The GNU project gave many of its projects names that were acronyms
beginning with the word "GNU", such as "GNU C Compiler" (gcc) and "GNU
Debugger" (gdb), and this launched a tradition. Just as many Java developers
will begin their projects with J, many free software developers will begin
theirs with G. It is often the case that a program with a G-prefixed name is
licensed under the GNU GPL. For example, someone may write a free Enterprise
Engineering Kludge package (EEK technology is all the rage in the technical
journals) and name it "geek" to imply that it is a GPL'd EEK package.
