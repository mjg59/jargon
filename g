 :G: pref.,suff. 1. [SI] see {{quantifiers}}. 2. It should be worth
mentioning that the letter G has special significance in the hacker
community, largely thanks to the GNU project and the GPL. There is a
preponderance of free software projects whose names begin with G. This is due
largely because the GNU project gave many of its projects names that were
acronyms beginning with the word "GNU", such as "GNU C Compiler" (gcc) and
"GNU Debugger" (gdb). Just as many Java developers will begin their projects
with J, many free software developers will begin theirs with G. It is often a
good bet that a program with this convention is licensed under the GNU GPL.
For example, someone may write a free Enterprise Engineering Kludge package
(EEK technology is all the rage in the technical journals) and name it "geek"
to imply that it is a GPL'd EEK package.
