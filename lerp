 LERP: /lerp/ vi.,n. Quasi-acronym for Linear Interpolation, used as a verb
or noun for the operation. E.g., Bresenham's algorithm lerps incrementally
between the two endpoints of the line. let the smoke out: v. To fry hardware
(see {fried}). see {magic smoke} for the mythology behind this. lexer:
/lek'sr/ n. Common hacker shorthand for `lexical analyzer', the
input-tokenizing stage in the parser for a language (the part that breaks it
into word-like pieces). "Some C lexers get confused by the old-style compound
ops like `=-'". life: n. 1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton
Conway and first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner (Scientific American,
October 1970). Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it, and
hackers at various places contributed heavily to the mathematical analysis of
this game (most notably Bill Gosper at MIT; see {Gosperism}). When a hacker
mentions `life', he is much more likely to mean this game than the magazine,
the breakfast cereal, or the human state of existence. 2. The opposite of
{USENET}. As in {Get a life!}. light pipe: n. Fiber optic cable. Oppose
{copper}. like kicking dead whales down the beach: adj. A slow, difficult,
and disgusting process. First popularized by a famous quote about the
difficulty of getting work done under one of IBM's mainframe OSs. "Well, you
*could* write a C compiler in COBOL, but it would be like kicking dead whales
down the beach." see also {fear and loathing} like nailing jelly to a tree:
adj. Used to describe a task thought to be impossible, esp. one in which the
difficulty arises from poor specification or inherent slipperiness in the
problem domain. line eater, the: [USENET] n. 1. A bug in some now-obsolete
versions of the netnews software that used to eat up to BUFSIZ bytes of the
article text. The bug was triggered by having the text of the article start
with a space or tab. This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature
called the `line eater', and postings often included a dummy line of `line
eater food'. Ironically, line eater food not preceded by whitespace wasn't
actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but if there *was* whitespace
before it, then the line eater would eat the food *and* the beginning of the
text which it was supposed to be protecting. The practice of `sacrificing to
the line eater' continued for some time after the bug had been {nailed to the
wall}, and is still humorously referred to. The bug itself is still (in
mid-1991) occasionally reported to be lurking in some mail-to-netnews
gateways. 2. see {NSA line eater}. line starve: [MIT] 1. vi. To feed paper
through a printer the wrong way by one line (most printers can't do this). On
a display terminal, to move the cursor up to the previous line of the screen.
Example: "To print `X squared', you just output `X', line starve, `2', line
feed." (The line starve causes the `2' to appear on the line above the X, and
the line feed gets back to the original line.) 2. n. A character (or
character sequence) that causes a terminal to perform this action. Unlike
`line feed', `line starve' is *not* standard {{ASCII}} terminology. Even
among hackers it is considered a bit silly. 3. [proposed] A sequence like \c
(used in System V echo, as well as nroff/troff) that suppresses a {newline}
or other character(s) that would normally implicitly be emitted. link farm:
[UNIX] n. A directory tree that contains many links to files in another,
master directory tree of files. Link farms save space when (for example) one
is maintaining several nearly identical copies of the same source tree, e.g.
when the only difference is architecture-dependent object files. Example use:
"Let's freeze the source and then rebuild the FROBOZZ-3 and FROBOZZ-4 link
farms." Link farms may also be used to get around restrictions on the number
of -I (include directory) arguments on older C preprocessors. lint: [from
UNIX's `lint(1)', named perhaps for the bits of fluff it picks from programs]
1. vt. To examine a program closely for style, language usage, and
portability problems, esp. if in C, esp. if via use of automated analysis
tools, most esp. if the UNIX utility `lint(1)' is used. This term used to be
restricted to use of `lint(1)' itself but (judging by references on USENET)
has become a shorthand for {desk check} at some non-UNIX shops, even in
languages other than C. see also {delint}. 2. n. Excess verbiage in a
document, as in "this draft has too much lint". lion food: [IBM] n. Middle
management or HQ staff (by extension, administrative drones in general). From
an old joke about two lions who, escaping from the zoo, split up to increase
their chances but agreed to meet after two months. When they finally meet,
one is skinny and the other overweight. The thin one says "How did you
manage? I ate a human just once and they turned out a small army to chase me
--- guns, nets, it was terrible. Since then I've been reduced to eating mice,
insects, even grass." The fat one replies "Well, *I* hid near an IBM office
and ate a manager a day. And nobody even noticed!"
