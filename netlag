 :netlag: [IRC, MUD] n. A condition that occurs when the delays in the {IRC}
network or on a {MUD} become severe enough that servers briefly lose and then
reestablish contact, causing messages to be delivered in bursts, often with
delays of up to a minute. (Note that this term has nothing to do with
mainstream "jet lag", a condition which hackers tend not to be much bothered
by.)
