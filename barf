 :barf: /barf/ [from mainstream slang meaning `vomit'] 1. interj. Term of
disgust. This is the closest hackish equivalent of the Val\-speak "gag me
with a spoon". (Like, euwww!) see {bletch}. 2. vi. To say "Barf!" or emit
some similar expression of disgust. "I showed him my latest hack and he
barfed" means only that he complained about it, not that he literally
vomited. 3. vi. To fail to work because of unacceptable input. May mean to
give an error message. Examples: "The division operation barfs if you try to
divide by 0." (That is, the division operation checks for an attempt to
divide by zero, and if one is encountered it causes the operation to fail in
some unspecified, but generally obvious, manner.) "The text editor barfs if
you try to read in a new file before writing out the old one." see {choke},
{gag}. In Commonwealth hackish, `barf' is generally replaced by `puke' or
`vom'. {barf} is sometimes also used as a {metasyntactic variable}, like
{foo} or {bar}.
