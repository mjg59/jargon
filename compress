 :compress: [UNIX] vt. When used without a qualifier, generally refers to
{crunch}ing of a file using a particular C implementation of compression by
James A. Woods et al. and widely circulated via {USENET}; use of {crunch}
itself in this sense is rare among UNIX hackers. Specifically, compress is
built around the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm as described in "A Technique for
High Performance Data Compression", Terry A. Welch, `IEEE Computer', vol. 17,
no. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8--19.
