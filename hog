 HOG n.,v. Favored term to describe programs or hardware which seem to eat
far more than their share of a system's resources, esp. those which
noticeably degrade general timesharing response. *Not* used of programs which
are simply extremely large or complex or which are merely painfully slow
themselves (see PIG, RUN LIKE A). More often than not encountered in
qualified forms, e.g. "memory hog", "core hog", "hog the processor", "hog the
disk". Example: "A controller that never gives up the I/O bus gets killed
after the bus hog timer expires."
