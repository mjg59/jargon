 HOG (hawg) n.,v. Favored term to describe programs which seem to eat far
more than their share of a system's resources, esp. those which noticeably
degrade general timesharing response. *Not* used of programs which are simply
extremely large or complex or which are merely painfully slow themselves (see
PIG, RUN LIKE A). More often than not encountered in qualified forms, e.g
MEMORY HOG, CORE HOG, HOG THE PROCESSOR, HOG THE DISK.
