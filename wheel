 :wheel: n. [from slang `big wheel' for a powerful person] A person who has
an active {wheel bit}. "We need to find a wheel to unwedge the hung tape
drives." (see {wedged}, sense 1.) The traditional name of security group zero
in {BSD} (to which the major system-internal users like {root} belong) is
`wheel'. Some vendors have expanded on this usage, modifying Unix so that
only members of group `wheel' can {go root}
