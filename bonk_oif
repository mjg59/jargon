 :bonk/oif: /bonk/, /oyf/ interj. In the {MUD} community, it has become
traditional to express pique or censure by `bonking' the offending person.
Convention holds that one should acknowledge a bonk by saying `oif!' and
there is a myth to the effect that failing to do so upsets the cosmic
bonk/oif balance, causing much trouble in the universe. Some MUDs have
implemented special commands for bonking and oifing. see also {talk mode}.
