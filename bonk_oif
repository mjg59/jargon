 :bonk/oif: /bonk/, /oyf/ interj. In the {MUD} community, it has become
traditional to express pique or censure by `bonking' the offending person.
There is a convention that one should acknowledge a bonk by saying `oif!' and
a myth to the effect that failing to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif
balance, causing much trouble in the universe. Some MUDs have implemented
special commands for bonking and oifing. see also {talk mode}, {posing}.
