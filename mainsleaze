 :mainsleaze: n. 1. Spam emitted by a reputable, mainstream company (as
opposed to fly-by-night Viagra oeddlers and the like). Sometime this happens
in honest ignorance, but the reputation danage can take years to live down.
2. Occasionally used for a big-time spammer, with its own {fat pipe}, their
own mailservers, and a {pink contract}. Almost impossible to get shut down.
