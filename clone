 :clone: n. 1. An exact duplicate: "Our product is a clone of their product."
Implies a legal reimplementation from documentation or by
reverse-engineering. Also connotes lower price. 2. A shoddy, spurious copy:
"Their product is a clone of our product." 3. A blatant ripoff, most likely
violating copyright, patent, or trade secret protections: "Your product is a
clone of my product." This use implies legal action is pending. 4. [obs] PC
clone: a PC-BUS/ISA/EISA/PCI-compatible 80x86-based microcomputer (this use
is sometimes spelled klone or PClone). These invariably have much more bang
for the buck than the IBM archetypes they resemble. This term fell out of use
in the 1990s; the class of machines it describes are now simply PCs or Intel
machines. 5. [obs.] In the construction Unix clone: An OS designed to deliver
a Unix-lookalike environment without Unix license fees, or with additional
`mission-critical' features such as support for real-time programming.
{Linux} and the free BSDs killed off this product category and the term with
it. 6. v. To make an exact copy of something. "Let me clone that" might mean
"I want to borrow that paper so I can make a photocopy" or "Let me get a copy
of that file before you {mung} it".
