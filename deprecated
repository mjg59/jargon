 :deprecated: adj. Said of a program or feature that is considered
obsolescent and in the process of being phased out, usually in favor of a
specified replacement. Deprecated features can, unfortunately, linger on for
many years. This term appears with distressing frequency in standards
documents when the committees which write them decide that a sufficient
number of users have written code which depends on specific features which
are out of favor.
