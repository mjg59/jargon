 MAGIC COOKIE [UNIX] n. 1. Something passed between routines or programs that
enables the receiver to perform some OBSCURE operation; a capability ticket.
Especially used of small data objects which contain data encoded in a strange
or intrinsically machine-dependent way. For example, on non-UNIX OSs with a
non-byte-stream model of files, the result of ftell(3) may be a `magic
cookie' rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to fseek(3) but not
operated on in any meaningful way. 2. An in-band code for changing graphic
rendition (i.e. inverse video or underlining) or performing other control
functions. Some older terminals would leave a blank on the screen
corresponding to mode-change cookies; this was also called a GLITCH.
