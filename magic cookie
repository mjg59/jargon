 :magic cookie: n. [Unix] 1. Something passed between routines or programs
that enables the receiver to perform some operation; a capability ticket or
opaque identifier. Especially used of small data objects that contain data
encoded in a strange or intrinsically machine-dependent way. E.g., on
non-Unix OSes with a non-byte-stream model of files, the result of `ftell(3)'
may be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to
`fseek(3)', but not operated on in any meaningful way. The phrase `it hands
you a magic cookie' means it returns a result whose contents are not defined
but which can be passed back to the same or some other program later. 2. An
in-band code for changing graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or
underlining) or performing other control functions (see also {cookie}). Some
older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to
mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a {glitch} (or occasionally a
`turd'; compare {mouse droppings}). see also {cookie}.
