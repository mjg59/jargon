 MAGIC COOKIE [UNIX] n. 1. Something passed between routines or programs that
enables the receiver to perform some OBSCURE operationl; a capability ticket.
Especially used of small data objects which contain data encoded in a strange
or intrinsically machine-dependent way. For example, on non-UNIX OSs with a
non-byte-stream model of files, the result of ftell(3) may be a `magic
cookie' rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to fseek(3) but not
operated on in any meaningful way. 2. A blank left on the screen when your
terminal changes modes. Some older terminals would print a blank when you
entered and exited special modes, such as underline or flash. This was also
called a GLITCH.
