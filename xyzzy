 :xyzzy: /X-Y-Z-Z-Y/, /X-Y-ziz'ee/, /ziz'ee/, or /ik-ziz'ee/ adj. [from the
ADVENT game] The {canonical} `magic word'. This comes from {ADVENT}, in which
the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to collect the
treasures you find there. If you type `xyzzy' at the appropriate time, you
can move instantly between two otherwise distant points. If, therefore, you
encounter some bit of {magic}, you might remark on this quite succinctly by
saying simply "Xyzzy!" "Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if
he has protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will
let you do it anyway." "Xyzzy!" Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an
undocumented no-op command on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for
example, it would typically respond "Nothing happens", just as {ADVENT} did
if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed
the action that enabled the word. In more recent 32-bit versions, by the way,
AOS/VS responds "Twice as much happens". see also {plugh}. = Y = =====
