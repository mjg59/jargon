 XYZZY /exs-wie-zee-zee-wie/ or /ik-zi'zee/ [from the ADVENT game] adj. The
CANONICAL "magic word". This comes from ADVENT (q.v.), in which the idea is
to explore an underground cave with many rooms to collect treasure. If you
type XYZZY at the appropriate time, you can move instantly between two
otherwise distant points. If, therefore, you encounter some bit of MAGIC, you
might remark on this quite succinctly by saying simply "XYZZY"! Example:
"Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected it,
but if you type quadruple-bucky-CLEAR the system will let you do it anyway."
"XYZZY!" XYZZY has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command
on several OSs; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
respond "Nothing happens." just as ADVENT did before a player had performed
the action that enabled the word. see PLUGH. {= Y =}
