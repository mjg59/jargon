 :Exploder: n. Used within Microsoft to refer to the Windows Explorer, the
interface component of Windows 95 and WinNT 4. Our spies report that most of
the heavy guns at MS came from a Unix background and use command line
utilities; even they are scornful of the over-gingerbreaded {WIMP
environment}s that they have been called upon to create.
