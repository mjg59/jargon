 :visionary: n. 1. One who hacks vision, in the sense of an Artificial
Intelligence researcher working on the problem of getting computers to `see'
things using TV cameras. (There isn't any problem in sending information from
a TV camera to a computer. The problem is, how can the computer be programmed
to make use of the camera information? see {SMOP}, {AI-complete}.) 2. [IBM]
One who reads the outside literature. At IBM, apparently, such a penchant is
viewed with awe and wonder.
