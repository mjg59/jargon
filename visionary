 VISIONARY n. One who hacks vision, in the sense of an Artificial
Intelligence researcher working on the problem of getting computers to "see"
things using TV cameras. (There isn't any problem in sending information from
a TV camera to a computer. The problem is, how can the computer be programmed
to make use of the camera information? see SMOP.)
