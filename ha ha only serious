 HA HA ONLY SERIOUS [from SF fandom] A phrase that aptly captures the flavor
of much hacker discourse (sometimes seen abbreviated as HHOS). Applied
especially to parodies, absurdities and ironic jokes that are both intended
and perceived to contain a possibly disquieting amount of truth, or truths
which are constructed on in-joke and self-parody. The jargon file contains
many examples of ha-ha-only-serious in both form and content. Indeed, the
entirety of hacker culture is often perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by
hackers themselves; to take it either too lightly or too seriously marks a
person as an outsider or one in LARVAL STAGE. For further enlightenment on
this subject, consult any Zen master. see also HUMOR, HACKER.
