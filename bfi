 :BFI: /B-F-I/ n. see {brute force and ignorance}. Also encountered in the
variants `BFMI', `brute force and _massive_ ignorance' and `BFBI' `brute
force and bloody ignorance'. In some parts of the U.S. this abbreviation was
probably reinforced by a company called Browning-Ferris Industries in the
waste-management business; a large BFI logo in white-on-blue could be seen on
the sides of garbage trucks.
