 CREEPING FEATURITIS /kree'ping fee-ch@r-ie't@s/ n. 1. Describes a systematic
tendency to load more CHROME onto systems at the expense of whatever ELEGANCE
they may have posessed when originally designed. see FEEPING CREATURITIS.
"You know, the main problem with BSD UNIX has always been creeping
featuritis". At MIT, this tends to be called CREEPING FEATUR*ISM* (and
likewise, FEEPING CREATURISM). (After all, -ism means "condition" whereas
-itis usually means "inflammation of"...) 2. More generally, The tendency for
anything complicated to become even more complicated because people keep
saying, "Gee, it would be even better if it had this feature too." (see
FEATURE.) The result is usually a patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step
at a time, rather than being planned. Planning is a lot of work, but it's
easy to add just one extra little feature to help someone... and then
another... and another.... When creeping featurism gets out of hand it's like
a cancer. Usually this term is used to describe computer programs, but it
could also be said of the federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new
cars.
