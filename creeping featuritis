 :creeping featuritis: /kree'ping fee'-chr-i:`t*s/ /n./ Variant of {creeping
featurism}, with its own spoonerization: `feeping creaturitis'. Some people
like to reserve this form for the disease as it actually manifests in
software or hardware, as opposed to the lurking general tendency in
designers' minds. (After all, -ism means `condition' or `pursuit of', whereas
-itis usually means `inflammation of'.)
