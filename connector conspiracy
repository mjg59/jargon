 :connector conspiracy: n. [probably came into prominence with the appearance
of the KL-10 (one model of the {PDP-10}), none of whose connectors matched
anything else] The tendency of manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers
or purveyors of anything) to come up with new products that don't fit
together with the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or
expensive interface devices. (A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly
different intent, is the habit manufacturers have of inventing new screw
heads so that only Designated Persons, possessing the magic screwdrivers, can
remove covers and make repairs or install options. A good 1990s example is
the use of Torx screws for cable-TV set-top boxes. Older Apple Macintoshes
took this one step further, requiring not only a long Torx screwdriver but a
specialized case-cracking tool to open the box.) In these latter days of
open-systems computing this term has fallen somewhat into disuse, to be
replaced by the observation that "Standards are great! There are so many of
them to choose from!" Compare {backward combatability}.
