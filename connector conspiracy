 CONNECTOR CONSPIRACY [probably came into prominence with the appearance of
the KL-10, none of whose connectors match anything else] n. The tendency of
manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of anything) to
come up with new products which don't fit together with the old stuff,
thereby making you buy either all new stuff or expensive interface devices.
