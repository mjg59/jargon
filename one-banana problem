 :one-banana problem: n. At mainframe shops, where the computers have
operators for routine administrivia, the programmers and hardware people tend
to look down on the operators and claim that a trained monkey could do their
job. It is frequently observed that the incentives which would be offered
said monkeys can be used as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task. A
one-banana problem is simple; hence "It's only a one-banana job at the most;
what's taking them so long?" At IBM, folklore divides the world into one-,
two-, and three-banana problems. Other cultures have different hierarchies
and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five grapes (a bunch)
equals a banana. Their upper limit for the in-house {sysape}s is said to be
two bananas and three grapes (another source claims it's three bananas and
one grape, but observes "However, this is subject to local variations, cosmic
rays and ISO"). At a complication level any higher than that, one asks the
manufacturers to send someone around to check things.
