 :shim: /n./ A small piece of data inserted in order to achieve a desired
memory alignment or other addressing property. For example, the PDP-11 Unix
linker, in split I&D (instructions and data) mode, inserts a two-byte shim at
location 0 in data space so that no data object will have an address of 0
(and be confused with the C null pointer). see also {loose bytes}.
