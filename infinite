 :infinite: adj. Consisting of a large number of objects; extreme. Used very
loosely as in: "This program produces infinite garbage." "He is an infinite
loser." The word most likely to follow `infinite', though, is {hair} (it has
been pointed out that fractals are an excellent example of infinite hair).
These uses are abuses of the word's mathematical meaning. The term
`semi-infinite', denoting an immoderately large amount of some resource, is
also heard. "This compiler is taking a semi-infinite amount of time to
optimize my program." see also {semi}.
