 FEAR AND LOATHING [from Hunter Thompson] n. State inspired by the prospect
of dealing with certain REAL WORLD systems and standards which are totally
BRAIN DAMAGED but ubiquitous -- Intel 8086s, or COBOL, or any IBM machine
except the Rios (aka the RS/6000). "Ack. They want PCs to be able to talk to
the AI machine. Fear and loathing time!" see also IBM.
