 FEAR AND LOATHING (feer @nd loh'thing) [from Hunter Thompson] n. State
inspired by the prospect of dealing with certain REAL WORLD systems and
standards which are totally BRAIN DAMAGED but ubiquitous -- Intel 8086s, or
COBOL, or any IBM machine except the Rios. "Ack. They want PCs to be able to
talk to the AI machine. Fear and loathing time!" see also IBM.
