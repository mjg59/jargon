 :fear and loathing: n. [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state inspired by the
prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems and standards that are
totally {brain-damaged} but ubiquitous -- Intel 8086s, or {COBOL}, or
{{EBCDIC}}, or any {IBM} machine except the Rios (a.k.a. the RS/6000). "Ack!
They want PCs to be able to talk to the AI machine. Fear and loathing time!"
