 :overflow pdl: [MIT] n. The place where you put things when your {pdl} is
full. If you don't have one and too many things get pushed, you forget
something. The overflow pdl for a person's memory might be a memo pad. This
usage inspired the following doggerel: Hey, diddle, diddle The overflow pdl
To get a little more stack; If that's not enough Then you lose it all, And
have to pop all the way back. --The Great Quux The term {pdl} seems to be
primarily an MITism; outside MIT this term is replaced by `overflow {stack}'.
