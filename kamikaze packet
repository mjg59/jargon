 :kamikaze packet: n. The `official' jargon for what is more commonly called
a {Christmas tree packet}. {RFC}-1025, `TCP and IP Bake Off' says: 10 points
for correctly being able to process a "Kamikaze" packet (AKA nastygram,
christmas tree packet, lamp test segment, et al.). That is, correctly handle
a segment with the maximum combination of features at once (e.g., a SYN URG
PUSH FIN segment with options and data). see also {Chernobyl packet}.
