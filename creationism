 :creationism: n. The (false) belief that large, innovative software designs
can be completely specified in advance and then painlessly magicked out of
the void by the normal efforts of a team of normally talented programmers. In
fact, experience has shown repeatedly that good designs arise only from
evolutionary, exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small handful
of) exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population --- and that
the first try at a big new idea is always wrong. Unfortunately, because these
truths don't fit the planning models beloved of {management}, they are
generally ignored.
