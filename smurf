 :smurf: /smerf/ [from the soc.motss newsgroup on USENET, after some
obnoxiously gooey cartoon characters] n. A newsgroup regular with a habitual
style that is irreverent, silly, and cute. Like many other hackish terms for
people, this one may be praise or insult depending on who uses it. In
general, being referred to as a smurf is probably not going to make your day
unless you've previously adopted the label yourself in a spirit of irony.
Compare {old fart}.
