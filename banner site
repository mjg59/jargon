 :banner site: n. [warez d00dz] An FTP site storing pirated files where one
must first click on several banners and/or subscribe to various `free'
services, usually generating some form of revenues for the site owner, to be
able to access the site. More often than not, the username/password painfully
obtained by clicking on banners and subscribing to bogus services or mailing
lists turns out to be non-working or gives access to a site that always
responds busy. see {ratio site}, {leech mode}.
