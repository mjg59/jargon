 :sacred: adj. Reserved for the exclusive use of something (an extension of
the standard meaning). Often means that anyone may look at the sacred object,
but clobbering it will screw whatever it is sacred to. The comment "Register
7 is sacred to the interrupt handler" appearing in a program would be
interpreted by a hacker to mean that if any *other* part of the program
changes the contents of register 7, dire consequences are likely to ensue.
