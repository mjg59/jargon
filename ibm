 3.[techspeak] A subset of a standard used for a particular purpose. This
sense confuses hackers who wander into the weird world of ISO standards no
end! :progasm: /proh'gaz-m/ n. [University of Wisconsin] The euphoria
experienced upon the completion of a program or other computer-related
project. :proglet: /prog'let/ n. [UK] A short extempore program written to
meet an immediate, transient need. Often written in BASIC, rarely more than a
dozen lines long, and containing no subroutines. The largest amount of code
that can be written off the top of one's head, that does not need any
editing, and that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies
significantly according to one's skill and the language one is using).
Compare {toy program}, {noddy}, {one-liner wars}. :program: n. 1. A magic
spell cast over a computer allowing it to turn one's input into error
messages. 2. An exercise in experimental epistemology. 3. A form of art,
ostensibly intended for the instruction of computers, which is nevertheless
almost inevitably a failure if other programmers can't understand it.
:Programmer's Cheer: "Shift to the left! Shift to the right! Pop up, push
down! Byte! Byte! Byte!" A joke so old it has hair on it. :programming: n. 1.
The art of debugging a blank sheet of paper (or, in these days of on-line
editing, the art of debugging an empty file). "Bloody instructions which,
being taught, return to plague their inventor" ("Macbeth", Act 1, Scene 7) 2.
A pastime similar to banging one's head against a wall, but with fewer
opportunities for reward. 3. The most fun you can have with your clothes on.
4. The least fun you can have with your clothes off. :programming fluid: n.
1. Coffee. 2. Cola. 3. Any caffeinacious stimulant. Many hackers consider
these essential for those all-night hacking runs. see {wirewater}. :propeller
head: n. Used by hackers, this is syn. with {computer geek}. Non-hackers
sometimes use it to describe all techies. Prob. derives from SF fandom's
tradition (originally invented by old-time fan Ray Faraday Nelson) of
propeller beanies as fannish insignia (though nobody actually wears them
except as a joke). :propeller key: n. [Mac users] see {feature key}.
:proprietary: adj. 1. In {marketroid}-speak, superior; implies a product
imbued with exclusive magic by the unmatched brilliance of the company's own
hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and users,
inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems standards, and
thus one that puts the customer at the mercy of a vendor able to gouge freely
on service and upgrade charges after the initial sale has locked the customer
in. Often in the phrase "proprietary crap". :protocol: n. As used by hackers,
this never refers to niceties about the proper form for addressing letters to
the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one should use the forks in a
Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care about such things. It is used
instead to describe any set of rules that allow different machines or pieces
of software to coordinate with each other without ambiguity. So, for example,
it does include niceties about the proper form for addressing packets on a
network or the order in which one should use the forks in the Dining
Philosophers Problem. It implies that there is some common message format and
an accepted set of primitives or commands that all parties involved
understand, and that transactions among them follow predictable logical
sequences. see also {handshaking}, {do protocol}. :provocative maintenance:
n. [common ironic mutation of `preventive maintenance'] Actions performed
upon a machine at regularly scheduled intervals to ensure that the system
remains in a usable state. So called because it is all too often performed by
a {field servoid} who doesn't know what he is doing; such `maintenance' often
_induces_ problems, or otherwise results in the machine's remaining in an
_un_usable state for an indeterminate amount of time. see also {scratch
monkey}. :prowler: n. [Unix] A {daemon} that is run periodically (typically
once a week) to seek out and erase {core} files, truncate administrative
logfiles, nuke `lost+found' directories, and otherwise clean up the {cruft}
that tends to pile up in the corners of a file system. see also {GFR},
{reaper}, {skulker}. :pseudo: /soo'doh/ n. [Usenet: truncation of
`pseudonym'] 1. An electronic-mail or {Usenet} persona adopted by a human for
amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of one's
net.behavior; a `nom de Usenet', often associated with forged postings
designed to conceal message origins. Perhaps the best-known and funniest hoax
of this type is {B1FF}. see also {tentacle}. 2. Notionally, a
{flamage}-generating AI program simulating a Usenet user. Many flamers have
been accused of actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI
program of the required sophistication yet exists. However, in 1989 there was
a famous series of forged postings that used a phrase-frequency-based
travesty generator to simulate the styles of several well-known flamers; it
was based on large samples of their back postings (compare {Dissociated
Press}). A significant number of people were fooled by the forgeries, and the
debate over their authenticity was settled only when the perpetrator came
forward to publicly admit the hoax. :pseudoprime: n. A backgammon prime (six
consecutive occupied points) with one point missing. This term is an esoteric
pun derived from number theory: a number that passes a certain kind of
"primality test" may be called a `pseudoprime' (all primes pass any such
test, but so do some composite numbers), and any number that passes several
is, in some sense, almost certainly prime. The hacker backgammon usage stems
from the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it will do the
same job unless you are unlucky. :pseudosuit: /soo'doh-s[y]oot`/ n. A {suit}
wannabee; a hacker who has decided that he wants to be in management or
administration and begins wearing ties, sport coats, and (shudder!) suits
voluntarily. It's his funeral. see also {lobotomy}. :psychedelicware:
/si:`k*-del'-ik-weir/ n. [UK] Syn. {display hack}. see also {smoking clover}.
:psyton: /si:'ton/ n. [TMRC] The elementary particle carrying the sinister
force. The probability of a process losing is proportional to the number of
psytons falling on it. Psytons are generated by observers, which is why demos
are more likely to fail when lots of people are watching. [This term appears
to have been largely superseded by {bogon}; see also {quantum bogodynamics}.
--ESR] :pubic directory: /pyoob'ik d*-rek't*-ree/) n. [NYU] (also `pube
directory' /pyoob' d*-rek't*-ree/) The `pub' (public) directory on a machine
that allows {FTP} access. So called because it is the default location for
{SEX} (sense 1). "I'll have the source in the pube directory by Friday."
:puff: vt. To decompress data that has been crunched by Huffman coding. At
least one widely distributed Huffman decoder program was actually _named_
`PUFF', but these days it is usually packaged with the encoder. Oppose
{huff}, see {inflate}. :pumpkin holder: n. see {patch pumpkin}. :pumpking: n.
Syn. for {pumpkin holder}; see {patch pumpkin}. :punched card:: n.obs.
[techspeak] (alt. `punch card') The signature medium of computing's {Stone
Age}, now obsolescent outside of some IBM shops. The punched card actually
predated computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for
mechanical looms. The version patented by Hollerith and used with mechanical
tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90
mm by 215 mm. There is a widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the
currency trays used for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent
investigations have falsified this. IBM (which originated as a
tabulating-machine manufacturer) married the punched card to computers,
encoding binary information as patterns of small rectangular holes; one
character per column, 80 columns per card. Other coding schemes, sizes of
card, and hole shapes were tried at various times. The 80-column width of
most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM punched card; so is the size
of the quick-reference cards distributed with many varieties of computers
even today. see {chad}, {chad box}, {eighty-column mind}, {green card},
{dusty deck}, {lace card}, {card walloper}. :punt: v. [from the punch line of
an old joke referring to American football: "Drop back 15 yards and punt!"]
1. To give up, typically without any intention of retrying. "Let's punt the
movie tonight." "I was going to hack all night to get this feature in, but I
decided to punt" may mean that you've decided not to stay up all night, and
may also mean you're not ever even going to put in the feature. 2. More
specifically, to give up on figuring out what the {Right Thing} is and resort
to an inefficient hack. 3. A design decision to defer solving a problem,
typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently well to
frame an algorithmic solution. "No way to know what the right form to dump
the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now." 4. To hand a tricky
implementation problem off to some other section of the design. "It's too
hard to get the compiler to do that; let's punt to the runtime system." 5. To
knock someone off an Internet or chat connection; a `punter' thus, is a
person or program that does this. :Purple Book: n. 1. The "System V Interface
Definition". The covers of the first editions were an amazingly nauseating
shade of off-lavender. 2. Syn. {Wizard Book}. Donald Lewine's "POSIX
Programmer's Guide" (O'Reilly, 1991, ISBN 0-937175-73-0). see also {{book
titles}}. :purple wire: n. [IBM] Wire installed by Field Engineers to work
around problems discovered during testing or debugging. These are called
`purple wires' even when (as is frequently the case) their actual physical
color is yellow.... Compare {blue wire}, {yellow wire}, and {red wire}.
:push: [from the operation that puts the current information on a stack, and
the fact that procedure return addresses are saved on a stack] (Also PUSH
/push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/, the latter based on the
