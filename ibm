 IBM (ie bee em) Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious
Black Magic; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near-INFINITE number of many
even less complementary expansions, including "International Business
Machines". see TLA. These abbreviations illustrate the considerable antipathy
most hackers have long felt for the "industry leader" (see FEAR AND
LOATHING). What galls hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level
isn't so much that they're underpowered and overpriced (though that counts
against them) but that the designs are incredibly archaic, crufty and
ELEPHANTINE and you can't *fix* them -- source is locked up tight and
programming tools are expensive, hard to find, and a bitch to use once you've
found them. With the release of the UNIX-based RIOS family this may have
begun to change -- but then, we thought that when the PC-RT came out, too. In
the spirit of universal peace and brotherhood the jargon list now includes a
number of entries marked `IBM'; these derive from a rampantly unofficial
jargon list circulated among IBM's own beleaguered hacker underground.
