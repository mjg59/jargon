 :IBM: /I·B·M/ Once upon a time, the computer company most hackers loved to
hate; today, the one they are most puzzled to find themselves liking. From
hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM was regarded
with active loathing. Common expansions of the corporate name included:
Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black Magic; It's
Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near-{infinite} number
of even less complimentary expansions (see also {fear and loathing}). What
galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much that
they were underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against them), but
that the designs were incredibly archaic, {crufty}, and {elephantine} ... and
you couldn't fix them -- source code was locked up tight, and programming
tools were expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you had found
them. We didn't know how good we had it back then. In the 1980s IBM had its
own troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from the
hacker community's view. Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more noxious
and omnipresent than IBM had ever been. In the late 1990s IBM re-invented
itself as a services company, began to release open-source software through
its AlphaWorks group, and began shipping {Linux} systems and building ties to
the Linux community. To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a
staunch friend of the hacker community and {open source} development, with
ironic consequences noted in the {FUD} entry. This lexicon includes a number
of entries attributed to `IBM'; these derive from some rampantly unofficial
jargon lists circulated within IBM's formerly beleaguered hacker underground.
