 T-shirts (only rarely computer related; that would be too obvious). A
substantial minority prefers `outdoorsy' clothing --- hiking boots ("in case
a mountain should suddenly spring up in the machine room", as one famous
parody put it), khakis, lumberjack or chamois shirts, and the like. Very few
actually fit the `National Lampoon' Nerd stereotype, though it lingers on at
MIT and may have been more common before 1975. These days, backpacks are more
common than briefcases, and the hacker `look' is more whole-earth than
whole-polyester. Hackers dress for comfort, function, and minimal maintenance
hassles rather than for appearance (some, perhaps unfortunately, take this to
extremes and neglect personal hygiene). They have a very low tolerance of
suits and other `business' attire; in fact, it is not uncommon for hackers to
quit a job rather than conform to a dress code. Female hackers almost never
wear visible makeup, and many use none at all. Reading Habits ==============
Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction. The
typical hacker household might subscribe to `Analog', `Scientific American',
`Co-Evolution Quarterly', and `Smithsonian'. Hackers often have a reading
range that astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to talk about it as
much. Many hackers spend as much of their spare time reading as the average
American burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves and shelves of
well-thumbed books in their homes. Other Interests =============== Some
hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the culture: science
fiction, music, medievalism, chess, go, backgammon, wargames, and
intellectual games of all kinds. (Role-playing games such as Dungeons and
Dragons used to be extremely popular among hackers but they lost a bit of
their luster as they moved into the mainstream and became heavily
commercialized.) Logic puzzles. Ham radio. Other interests that seem to
correlate less strongly but positively with hackerdom include linguistics and
theater teching. Physical Activity and Sports ============================
Many (perhaps even most) hackers don't follow or do sports at all and are
determinedly anti-physical. Among those who do, interest in spectator sports
is low to non-existent; sports are something one *does*, not something one
watches on TV. Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague
(volleyball is a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and
relatively friendly). Hacker sports are almost always primarily
self-competitive ones involving concentration, stamina, and micromotor
skills: martial arts, bicycling, auto racing, kite flying, hiking, rock
climbing, aviation, target-shooting, sailing, caving, juggling, skiing,
skating (ice and roller). Hackers' delight in techno-toys also tends to draw
them towards hobbies with nifty complicated equipment that they can tinker
with. Education ========= Nearly all hackers past their teens are either
college-degreed or self-educated to an equivalent level. The self-taught
hacker is often considered (at least by other hackers) to be
better-motivated, and may be more respected, than his school-shaped
counterpart. Academic areas from which people often gravitate into hackerdom
include (besides the obvious computer science and electrical engineering)
physics, mathematics, linguistics, and philosophy. Things Hackers Detest and
Avoid =============================== IBM mainframes. Smurfs, Ewoks, and
other forms of offensive cuteness. Bureaucracies. Stupid people. Easy
listening music. Television (except for cartoons, movies, the old "Star
Trek", and the new "Simpsons"). Business suits. Dishonesty. Incompetence.
Boredom. COBOL. BASIC. Character-based menu interfaces. Food ==== Ethnic.
Spicy. Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan, Hunan, and Mandarin
(hackers consider Cantonese vaguely d'eclass'e). Hackers prefer the exotic;
for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will eat with gusto such
delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale. Thai food has
experienced flurries of popularity. Where available, high-quality Jewish
delicatessen food is much esteemed. A visible minority of Southwestern and
Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican. For those all-night hacks, pizza and
microwaved burritos are big. Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has
tended to think of hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at
least mildly health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about
what they eat. This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark 10--15 years ago. Politics ======== Vaguely
left of center, except for the strong libertarian contingent which rejects
conventional left-right politics entirely. The only safe generalization is
that hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; thus, both conventional
conservatism and `hard' leftism are rare. Hackers are far more likely than
most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or (b) entertain
peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to live by them
day-to-day. Gender and Ethnicity ==================== Hackerdom is still
predominantly male. However, the percentage of women is clearly higher than
the low-single-digit range typical for technical professions, and female
hackers are generally respected and dealt with as equals. In the U.S.,
hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities of Jews (East
Coast) and Orientals (West Coast). The Jewish contingent has exerted a
particularly pervasive cultural influence (see Food, above, and note that
several common jargon terms are obviously mutated Yiddish). The ethnic
distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a function of which
ethnic groups tend to seek and value education. Racial and ethnic prejudice
is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing contempt. When asked,
hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and color-blindness to a
positive effect of text-only network channels. Religion ======== Agnostic.
Atheist. Non-observant Jewish. Neo-pagan. Very commonly, three or more of
these are combined in the same person. Conventional faith-holding
Christianity is rare though not unknown. Even hackers who identify with a
religious affiliation tend to be relaxed about it, hostile to organized
religion in general and all forms of religious bigotry in particular. Many
enjoy `parody' religions such as Discordianism and the Church of the
SubGenius. Also, many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen
Buddhism or (less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their `native'
religions. There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility
that shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with
neo-paganism, Discordianism, or Zen. Hacker folklore that pays homage to
`wizards' and speaks of incantations and demons has too much psychological
truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke. Ceremonial Chemicals
==================== Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in
moderation if at all (though there is a visible contingent of exotic-beer
fanciers, and a few hackers are serious oenophiles). Limited use of
non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD, psilocybin, and
nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is still regarded with
more tolerance than in the mainstream culture. Use of `downers' and opiates,
on the other hand, appears to be particularly rare; hackers seem in general
to dislike drugs that `dumb them down'. On the third hand, many hackers
regularly wire up on caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking runs.
Communication Style =================== see the discussions of speech and
writing styles near the beginning of this File. Though hackers often have
poor person-to-person communication skills, they are as a rule extremely
sensitive to nuances of language and very precise in their use of it. They
are often better at writing than at speaking. Geographical Distribution
========================= In the United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay
Area-to-Boston axis; about half of the hard core seems to live within a
hundred miles of Cambridge (Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although
there are significant contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest,
and around Washington DC. Hackers tend to cluster around large cities,
especially `university towns' such as the Raleigh-Durham area in North
Carolina or Princeton, New Jersey (this may simply reflect the fact that many
are students or ex-students living near their alma maters). Sexual Habits
============= Hackerdom tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle
variation than the mainstream culture. It includes a relatively large gay
contingent. Hackers are somewhat more likely to live in polygynous or
polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or live in communes or
group houses. In this, as in general appearance, hackerdom semi-consciously
maintains `counterculture' values. Personality Characteristics
=========================== The most obvious common `personality'
characteristics of hackers are high intelligence, consuming curiosity, and
facility with intellectual abstractions. Also, most hackers are `neophiles',
stimulated by and appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty).
Most are also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist. Although high
general intelligence is common among hackers, it is not the sine qua non one
might expect. Another trait is probably even more important: the ability to
mentally absorb, retain, and reference large amounts of `meaningless' detail,
trusting to later experience to give it context and meaning. A person of
merely average analytical intelligence who has this trait can become an
effective hacker, but a creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find
himself outdistanced by people who routinely upload the contents of thick
reference manuals into their brains. [During the production of this book, for
example, I learned most of the rather complex typesetting language TeX over
about four working days, mainly by inhaling Knuth's 477-page manual. My
editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely surprised me, because years
of associating with hackers have conditioned me to consider such performances
routine and to be expected. --- ESR] Contrary to stereotype, hackers are
*not* usually intellectually narrow; they tend to be interested in any
subject that can provide mental stimulation, and can often discourse
knowledgeably and even interestingly on any number of obscure subjects --- if
you can get them to talk at all, as opposed to, say, going back to their
hacking. It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that
the better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have
outside interests at which he or she is more than merely competent. Hackers
are `control freaks' in a way that has nothing to do with the usual coercive
or authoritarian connotations of the term. In the same way that children
delight in making model trains go forward and back by moving a switch,
hackers love making complicated things like computers do nifty stuff for
them. But it has to be *their* nifty stuff. They don't like tedium,
nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring, ill-defined little tasks that
go with maintaining a normal existence. Accordingly, they tend to be careful
and orderly in their intellectual lives and chaotic elsewhere. Their code
will be beautiful, even if their desks are buried in 3 feet of crap. Hackers
are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards such as
social approval or money. They tend to be attracted by challenges and excited
by interesting toys, and to judge the interest of work or other activities in
terms of the challenges offered and the toys they get to play with. In terms
of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom appears to
concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is, introverted,
intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed to the extroverted-sensate
personalities that predominate in the mainstream culture). ENT[JP] types are
also concentrated among hackers but are in a minority. Weaknesses of the
Hacker Personality ==================================== Hackers have
relatively little ability to identify emotionally with other people. This may
be because hackers generally aren't much like `other people'. Unsurprisingly,
hackers also tend towards self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and
impatience with people and tasks perceived to be wasting their time. As
cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the world,
they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational, `cool', and
imaginative as they consider themselves. This bias often contributes to
weakness in communication skills. Hackers tend to be especially poor at
confrontation and negotiation. As a result of all the above traits, many
hackers have difficulty maintaining stable relationships. At worst, they can
produce the classic {computer geek}: withdrawn, relationally incompetent,
sexually frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her
craft. Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than mainstream folklore
paints it --- but almost all hackers will recognize something of themselves
in the unflattering paragraphs above. Hackers are often monumentally
disorganized and sloppy about dealing with the physical world. Bills don't
get paid on time, clutter piles up to incredible heights in homes and
offices, and minor maintenance tasks get deferred indefinitely. The sort of
person who uses phrases like `incompletely socialized' usually thinks hackers
are. Hackers regard such people with contempt when they notice them at all.
Miscellaneous ============= Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs
(in fact, it is widely grokked that cats have the hacker nature). Many drive
incredibly decrepit heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive spiffy
Porsches and RX-7s and then forget to have them washed. Almost all hackers
have terribly bad handwriting, and often fall into the habit of
block-printing everything like junior draftsmen. Bibliography ************
Here are some other books you can read to help you understand the hacker
mindset. `G"odel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid' Douglas Hofstadter
Basic Books, 1979 ISBN 0-394-74502-7 This book reads like an intellectual
Grand Tour of hacker preoccupations. Music, mathematical logic, programming,
speculations on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen are woven into a
brilliant tapestry themed on the concept of encoded self-reference. The
perfect left-brain companion to `Illuminatus'. `The Illuminatus Trilogy' I.
`The Eye in the Pyramid' II. `The Golden Apple' III. `Leviathan'. Robert Shea
and Robert Anton Wilson Dell, 1988 ISBN 0-440-53981-1 This work of alleged
fiction is an incredible berserko-surrealist rollercoaster of world-girdling
conspiracies, intelligent dolphins, the fall of Atlantis, who really killed
JFK, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, and the Cosmic Giggle Factor. First published
in three volumes, but there is now a one-volume trade paperback, carried by
most chain bookstores under SF. The perfect right-brain companion to
Hofstadter's `G"odel, Escher, Bach'. see {Eris}, {Discordianism}, {random
numbers}, {Church Of The Sub-Genius}. `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'
Douglas Adams Pocket Books, 1981 ISBN 0-671-46149-4 This `Monty Python in
Space' spoof of SF genre traditions has been popular among hackers ever since
the original British radio show. Read it if only to learn about Vogons (see
{bogons}) and the significance of the number 42 (see {random numbers}) ---
and why the winningest chess program of 1990 was called `Deep Thought'. `The
Tao of Programming' James Geoffrey Infobooks, 1987 ISBN 0-931137-07-1 This
gentle, funny spoof of the `Tao Te Ching' contains much that is illuminating
about the hacker way of thought. "When you have learned to snatch the error
code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave." `Hackers' Steven
Levy Anchor/Doubleday 1984 ISBN 0-385-19195-2 Levy's book is at its best in
describing the early MIT hackers at the Model Railroad Club and the early
days of the microcomputer revolution. He never understood UNIX or the
networks, though, and his enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true
hacker" turns out (thankfully) to have been quite misleading. Numerous minor
factual errors also mar the text; for example, Levy's claim that the original
Jargon File derived from the TMRC Dictionary (the File originated at Stanford
and was brought to MIT in 1976; the co-authors of the first edition had never
seen the dictionary in question). There are also numerous misspellings in the
book that inflame the passions of old-timers; as Dan Murphy, the author of
TECO, once said: "You would have thought he'd take the trouble to spell the
name of a winning editor right." Nevertheless, this remains a useful and
stimulating book that captures the feel of several important hackish
subcultures. `The Devil's DP Dictionary' Stan Kelly-Bootle McGraw-Hill, 1981
ISBN 0-07-034022-6 This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar
in format to the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from jargon-1) but
somewhat different in tone and intent. It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and quirky
imagination. For example, it defines `computer science' as "a study akin to
numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision of the former and the
success of the latter" and "the boring art of coping with a large number of
trivialities." `The Devouring Fungus: Tales from the Computer Age' Karla
Jennings Norton, 1990 ISBN 0-393-30732-8 The author of this pioneering
compendium knits together a great deal of computer- and hacker-related
folklore with good writing and a few well-chosen cartoons. She has a keen eye
for the human aspects of the lore and is very good at illuminating the
psychology and evolution of hackerdom. Unfortunately, a number of small
errors and awkwardnesses suggest that she didn't have the final manuscript
checked over by a native speaker; the glossary in the back is particularly
embarrassing, and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold
here in appendix A) is given in incomplete and badly mangled form.
Nevertheless, this book is a win overall and can be enjoyed by hacker and
non-hacker alike. `The Soul of a New Machine' Tracy Kidder Little, Brown,
1981 (paperback: Avon, 1982 ISBN 0-380-59931-7) This book (a 1982 Pulitzer
Prize winner) documents the adventure of the design of a new Data General
computer, the Eclipse. It is an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker
mindset --- although largely the hardware hacker --- done by a complete
outsider. It is a bit thin in spots, but with enough technical information to
be entertaining to the serious hacker while providing non-technical people a
view of what day-to-day life can be like --- the fun, the excitement, the
disasters. During one period, when the microcode and logic were glitching at
the nanosecond level, one of the overworked engineers departed the company,
leaving behind a note on his terminal as his letter of resignation: "I am
going to a commune in Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than
a season." `Life with UNIX: a Guide for Everyone' Don Libes and Sandy Ressler
Prentice-Hall, 1989 ISBN 0-13-536657-7 The authors of this book set out to
tell you all the things about UNIX that tutorials and technical books won't.
The result is gossipy, funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and
invaluable. Along the way they expose you to enough of UNIX's history,
folklore and humor to qualify as a first-class source for these things.
Because so much of today's hackerdom is involved with UNIX, this in turn
illuminates many of its in-jokes and preoccupations. `True Names ... and
Other Dangers' Vernor Vinge Baen Books, 1987 ISBN 0-671-65363 Hacker demigod
Richard Stallman believes the title story of this book "expresses the spirit
of hacking best". This may well be true; it's certainly difficult to recall a
better job. The other stories in this collection are also fine work by an
author who is perhaps one of today's very best practitioners of hard SF.
`Technobabble' John Barry MIT Press 1991 ISBN 0-262-02333-4 Barry's book
takes a critical and humorous look at the `technobabble' of acronyms,
neologisms, hyperbole, and metaphor spawned by the computer industry. Though
he discusses some of the same mechanisms of jargon formation that occur in
hackish, most of what he chronicles is actually suit-speak --- the
obfuscatory language of press releases, marketroids, and Silicon Valley CEOs
rather than the playful jargon of hackers (most of whom wouldn't be caught
dead uttering the kind of pompous, passive-voiced word salad he deplores).
`The Cuckoo's Egg' Clifford Stoll Doubleday 1989 ISBN 0-385-24946-2 Clifford
Stoll's absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess and the Chaos Club
cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between `hacker' and
`cracker'. Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha, and his friends at
Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously vivid picture of how
hackers and the people around them like to live and what they think.
