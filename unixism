 :unixism: n. A piece of code or a coding technique that depends on the
protected multi-tasking environment with relatively low process-spawn
overhead that exists on virtual-memory Unix systems. Common {unixism}s
include: gratuitous use of fork(2); the assumption that certain undocumented
but well-known features of Unix libraries such as stdio(3) are supported
elsewhere; reliance on {obscure} side-effects of system calls (use of
sleep(2) with a 0 argument to clue the scheduler that you're willing to give
up your time-slice, for example); the assumption that freshly allocated
memory is zeroed; and the assumption that fragmentation problems won't arise
from never free()ing memory. Compare {vaxocentrism}; see also {New Jersey}.
