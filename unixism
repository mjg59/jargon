 UNIXISM n. A piece of code or coding technique that depends on of the
protected multi-tasking environment with relatively low process-spawn
overhead that exists on UNIX systems. Common UNIXISMs include: gratuitous use
of fork(2); the assumption that certain undocumented but well-known features
of UNIX libraries like stdio(3) are supported elsewhere; reliance on OBSCURE
side-effects of sytem calls (use of sleep(2) with a zero argument to clue the
scheduler that you're willing to give up your time-slice, for example); the
assumption that freshly-allocated memory is empty, the assumption that it's
safe to never free() memory, etc.
