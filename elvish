 :elvish: /n./ 1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms resembling
the beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book of Kells". Invented and
described by J. R. R. Tolkien in "The Lord of The Rings" as an orthography
for his fictional `elvish' languages, this system (which is both visually and
phonetically {elegant}) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to be intrigued
by artificial languages in general). It is traditional for graphics printers,
plotters, window systems, and the like to support a Feanorian typeface as one
of their demo items. see also {elder days}. 2. By extension, any odd or
unreadable typeface produced by a graphics device. 3. The typeface mundanely
called `B"ocklin', an art-decoish display font.
