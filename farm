 :farm: n. A group of machines, especially a large group of near-identical
machines running load-balancing software, dedicated to a single task.
Historically the term `server farm', used especially for a group of web
servers, seems to have been coined by analogy with earlier {disk farm} in the
early 1990s; generalization began with `render farm' for a group of machines
dedicated to rendering computer animations (this term appears to have been
popularized by publicity about the pioneering "Linux render farm" used to
produce the movie "Titanic"). By 2001 other combinations such as "compile
farm" and "compute farm" were increasingly common, and arguably borderline
techspeak. More jargon uses seem likely to arise (and be absorbed into
techspeak over time) as new uses are discovered for networked machine
clusters. Compare {link farm}.
