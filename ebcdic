 :EBCDIC:: /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ n. [abbreviation,
Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An alleged character set used
on IBM {dinosaur}s. It exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions,
all featuring such delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the
absence of several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern
computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies according to
which version of EBCDIC you're looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from {{punched
card}} code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control
tactic (see {connector conspiracy}), spurning the already established ASCII
standard. Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own
description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still
internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers blanch at the
very _name_ of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of purest {evil}. see
also {fear and loathing}.
