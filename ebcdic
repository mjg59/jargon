 EBCDIC:: /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ [acronym, Extended Binary
Coded Decimal Interchange Code] n. An alleged character set used on IBM
{dinosaur}s. It exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions, all
featuring such delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of
several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern computer
languages (exactly which characters are absent varies according to which
version of EBCDIC you're looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from {{punched
card}} code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control
tactic (see {connector conspiracy}), spurning the already established ASCII
standard. Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own
description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still
internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers blanch at the
very *name* of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of purest {evil}. see
also {fear and loathing}. echo: [FidoNet] n. A {topic group} on {FidoNet}'s
echomail system. Compare {newsgroup}. eighty-column mind: [IBM] n. The sort
said to be possessed by persons for whom the transition from {punched card}
to tape was traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet). It is
said that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder of
IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being the bottom of
the card). This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1422 and 1602 card readers
and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel called "The Last Bug", the
climactic lines of which are as follows: He died at the console Of hunger and
thirst. Next day he was buried, Face down, 9-edge first. The eighty-column
mind is thought by most hackers to dominate IBM's customer base and its
thinking. see {IBM}, {fear and loathing}, {card walloper}. El Camino Bignum:
/el' k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ n. The road mundanely called El Camino Real, a road
through the San Francisco peninsula that originally extended all the way down
to Mexico City and many portions of which are still intact. Navigation on the
San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real, which
defines {logical} north and south even though it isn't really north-south
many places. El Camino Real runs right past Stanford University and so is
familiar to hackers. The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables:
/ray-ahl'/) means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'. In the FORTRAN
language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to 7 significant
digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger floating-point number,
precise to perhaps fourteen significant digits (other languages have similar
`real' types). When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked
what a long road El Camino Real was. Making a pun on `real', he started
calling it `El Camino Double Precision' --- but when the hacker was told that
the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it `El Camino Bignum', and
that name has stuck. (see {bignum}.) elder days: n. The heroic age of
hackerdom (roughly, pre-1980); the era of the {PDP-10}, {TECO}, {{ITS}}, and
the ARPANET. This term has been rather consciously adopted from J. R. R.
Tolkien's fantasy epic `The Lord of the Rings'. Compare {Iron Age}; see also
{elvish}. elegant: [from mathematical usage] adj. Combining simplicity,
power, and a certain ineffable grace of design. Higher praise than `clever',
`winning', or even {cuspy}. elephantine: adj. Used of programs or systems
that are both conspicuous {hog}s (owing perhaps to poor design founded on
{brute force and ignorance}) and exceedingly {hairy} in source form. An
elephantine program may be functional and even friendly, but (as in the old
joke about being in bed with an elephant) it's tough to have around all the
same (and, like a pachyderm, difficult to maintain). In extreme cases,
hackers have been known to make trumpeting sounds or perform expressive
proboscatory mime at the mention of the offending program. Usage:
semi-humorous. Compare `has the elephant nature' and the somewhat more
pejorative {monstrosity}. see also {second-system effect} and {baroque}.
elevator controller: n. Another archetypal dumb embedded-systems application,
like {toaster} (which superseded it). During one period (1983--84) in the
deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C standardization committee) this was the
canonical example of a really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.
"You can't require `printf(3)' to be part of the default runtime library ---
what if you're targeting an elevator controller?" Elevator controllers became
important rhetorical weapons on both sides of several {holy wars}.
