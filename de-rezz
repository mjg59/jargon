 DE-REZZ (dee rez) [from the movie TRON] v. To disappear or dissolve; the
image that goes with it is of an object breaking up into raster lines and
static and then dissolving. Occasionally used of a person who seems to have
suddenly "fuzzed out" mentally rather than physically. Usage: extremely
silly, also rare. This verb was actually invented as *fictional* hacker
slang, and adopted in a spirit of irony by real hackers years after the fact.
