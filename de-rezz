 DE-REZZ, DEREZ /dee rez/ [from the movie TRON] 1. vi. To disappear or
dissolve; the image that goes with it is of an object breaking up into raster
lines and static and then dissolving. Occasionally used of a person who seems
to have suddenly "fuzzed out" mentally rather than physically. Usage:
extremely silly, also rare. This verb was actually invented as *fictional*
hacker slang, and adopted in a spirit of irony by real hackers years after
the fact. 2. vt. On a Macintosh, the data is compiled separately from the
program, in small segments of the program file known as "resources". The
standard resource compiler is Rez. The standard resource decompiler is DeRez.
Usage: very common.
