 :de-rezz: /dee-rez'/ [from `de-resolve' via the movie "Tron"] (also `derez')
1. /vi./ To disappear or dissolve; the image that goes with it is of an
object breaking up into raster lines and static and then dissolving.
Occasionally used of a person who seems to have suddenly `fuzzed out'
mentally rather than physically. Usage: extremely silly, also rare. This verb
was actually invented as *fictional* hacker jargon, and adopted in a spirit
of irony by real hackers years after the fact. 2. /vt./ The Macintosh
resource decompiler. On a Macintosh, many program structures (including the
code itself) are managed in small segments of the program file known as
`resources'; `Rez' and `DeRez' are a pair of utilities for compiling and
decompiling resource files. Thus, decompiling a resource is `derezzing'.
Usage: very common.
