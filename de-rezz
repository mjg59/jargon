 :de-rezz: /dee-rez'/ [from `de-resolve' via the movie "Tron"] (also `derez')
1. vi. To disappear or dissolve; the image that goes with it is of an object
breaking up into raster lines and static and then dissolving. Occasionally
used of a person who seems to have suddenly `fuzzed out' mentally rather than
physically. Usage: extremely silly, also rare. This verb was actually
invented as *fictional* hacker jargon, and adopted in a spirit of irony by
real hackers years after the fact. 2. vt. On a Macintosh, many program
structures (including the code itself) are managed in small segments of the
program file known as `resources'. The standard resource compiler is Rez. The
standard resource decompiler is DeRez. Thus, decompiling a resource is
`derezzing'. Usage: very common.
