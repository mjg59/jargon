 :rogue: 1. [Unix] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character
graphics, written under BSD Unix and subsequently ported to other Unix
systems. The original BSD curses(3) screen-handling package was hacked
together by Ken Arnold primarily to support games, and the development of
rogue(6) popularized its use; it has since become one of Unix's most
important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, Omega, Larn,
Angband, and an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games (all known as
`roguelikes') all took off from the inspiration provided by rogue(6); the
popular Windows game Diablo, though graphics-intensive, has very similar play
logic. see also {nethack}, {moria}, {Angband}. 2. [Usenet] adj. An {ISP}
which permits net abuse (usually in the form of {spam}ming) by its customers,
or which itself engages in such activities. Rogue ISPs are sometimes subject
to {IDP}s or {UDP}s. Sometimes deliberately misspelled as "rouge".
