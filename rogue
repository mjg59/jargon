 :rogue: [UNIX] n. A Dungeons-and-Dragons-like game using character graphics,
written under BSD UNIX and subsequently ported to other UNIX systems. The
original BSD `curses(3)' screen-handling package was hacked together by Ken
Arnold to support `rogue(6)' and has since become one of UNIX's most
important and heavily used application libraries. Nethack, Omega, Larn, and
an entire subgenre of computer dungeon games all took off from the
inspiration provided by `rogue(6)'. see {nethack}.
