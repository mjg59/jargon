 :lace card: /n. obs./ A {{punched card}} with all holes punched (also called
a `whoopee card' or `ventilator card'). Card readers tended to jam when they
got to one of these, as the resulting card had too little structural strength
to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. Card punches could also jam trying to
produce these things owing to power-supply problems. When some practical
joker fed a lace card through the reader, you needed to clear the jam with a
`card knife' -- which you used on the joker first.
