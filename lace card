 LACE CARD n. obs. A Hollerith card with all holes punched (also called a
WHOOPEE CARD). Card readers jammed when they got to one of these, as the
resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside
the mechanism. When some practical joker fed a LACE CARD through the reader
you needed to clear the jam with a card knife --- which you use on the joker
first.
