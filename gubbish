 :gubbish: /guhb'@sh/, n. [a portmanteau of `garbage' and `rubbish'; may have
originated with SF author Philip K. Dick] Garbage; crap; nonsense. "What is
all this gubbish?" The opposite portmanteau `rubbage' is also reported; in
fact, it was British slang during the 19th century and appears in Dickens.
