 :cycle drought: /n./ A scarcity of cycles. It may be due to a {cycle
crunch}, but it could also occur because part of the computer is temporarily
not working, leaving fewer cycles to go around. "The {high moby} is {down},
so we're running with only half the usual amount of memory. There will be a
cycle drought until it's fixed."
