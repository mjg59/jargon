 CYCLE DROUGHT n. A scarcity of cycles. It may be due to a CYCLE CRUNCH, but
could also occur because part of the computer is temporarily not working,
leaving fewer cycles to go around. Example: "The HIGH MOBY is DOWN, so we're
running with only half the usual amount of memory. There will be a CYCLE
DROUGHT until it's fixed." {= D =}
