 :generate: vt. To produce something according to an algorithm or program or
set of rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side effect of the execution of
an algorithm or program. The opposite of {parse}. This term retains its
mechanistic connotations (though often humorously) when used of human
behavior. "The guy is rational most of the time, but mention nuclear energy
around him and he'll generate {infinite} flamage."
