 :compact: /adj./ Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can
all be apprehended at once in one's head. This generally means the thing
created from the design can be used with greater facility and fewer errors
than an equivalent tool that is not compact. Compactness does not imply
triviality or lack of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not,
but C is more powerful than FORTRAN. Designs become non-compact through
accreting {feature}s and {cruft} that don't merge cleanly into the overall
design scheme (thus, some fans of {Classic C} maintain that ANSI C is no
longer compact).
