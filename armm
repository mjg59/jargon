 :ARMM: n. [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation'] A Usenet
{cancelbot} created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls, Ohio. ARMM was intended to
automatically cancel posts from anonymous-posting sites. Unfortunately, the
robot's recognizer for anonymous postings triggered on its own
automatically-generated control messages! Transformed by this stroke of
programming ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it
broke loose on the night of March 30, 1993 and proceeded to {spam}
news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200 messages. ARMM's bug
produced a recursive {cascade} of messages each of which mechanically added
text to the ID and Subject and some other headers of its parent. This
produced a flood of messages in which each header took up several screens and
each message ID and subject line got longer and longer and longer. Reactions
varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological messages crashed at least
one mail system, and upset people paying line charges for their Usenet feeds.
One poster described the ARMM debacle as "instant Usenet history" (also
establishing the term {despew}), and it has since been widely cited as a
cautionary example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
incompetence can wreak on a network. The Usenet thread on the subject is
archived here. Compare {Great Worm}; {sorcerer's apprentice mode}. see also
