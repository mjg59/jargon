 CMU hackers during some period leading up to mid-1990 were of that flavor.
see also {rotary debugger}; compare {ISO standard cup of tea}. :AOL!: n.
[Usenet] Common synonym for "Me, too!" alluding to the legendary propensity
of America Online users to utter contentless "Me, too!" postings. The number
of exclamation points following varies from zero to five or so. The
pseudo-HTML "<AOL>Me, too!</AOL>" is also frequently seen. see also
{September that never ended}. :app: /ap/ n. Short for `application program',
as opposed to a systems program. Apps are what systems vendors are forever
chasing developers to create for their environments so they can sell more
boxes. Hackers tend not to think of the things they themselves run as apps;
thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes compilers, program editors, games,
and messaging systems, though a user would consider all those to be apps.
(Broadly, an app is often a self-contained environment for performing some
well-defined task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
general-purpose tools.) see {killer app}; oppose {tool}, {operating system}.
:arena: n. [common; Unix] The area of memory attached to a process by
`brk(2)' and `sbrk(2)' and used by `malloc(3)' as dynamic storage. So named
from a `malloc: corrupt arena' message emitted when some early versions
detected an impossible value in the free block list. see {overrun screw},
{aliasing bug}, {memory leak}, {memory smash}, {smash the stack}. :arg: /arg/
n. Abbreviation for `argument' (to a function), used so often as to have
become a new word (like `piano' from `pianoforte'). "The sine function takes
1 arg, but the arc-tangent function can take either 1 or 2 args." Compare
{param}, {parm}, {var}. :ARMM: n. [acronym, `Automated Retroactive Minimal
Moderation'] A Usenet {cancelbot} created by Dick Depew of Munroe Falls,
Ohio. ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from anonymous-posting
sites. Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for anonymous postings triggered
on its own automatically-generated control messages! Transformed by this
stroke of programming ineptitude into a monster of Frankensteinian
proportions, it broke loose on the night of March 31, 1993 and proceeded to
{spam} news.admin.policy with a recursive explosion of over 200 messages.
ARMM's bug produced a recursive {cascade} of messages each of which
mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and some other headers of its
parent. This produced a flood of messages in which each header took up
several screens and each message ID and subject line got longer and longer
and longer. Reactions varied from amusement to outrage. The pathological
messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line
charges for their Usenet feeds. One poster described the ARMM debacle as
"instant Usenet history" (also establishing the term {despew}), and it has
since been widely cited as a cautionary example of the havoc the combination
of good intentions and incompetence can wreak on a network. Compare {Great
Worm}; {sorcerer's apprentice mode}. see also {software laser}, {network
meltdown}. :armor-plated: n. Syn. for {bulletproof}. :asbestos: adj. [common]
Used as a modifier to anything intended to protect one from {flame}s; also in
other highly {flame}-suggestive usages. see, for example, {asbestos
longjohns} and {asbestos cork award}. :asbestos cork award: n. Once, long ago
at MIT, there was a {flamer} so consistently obnoxious that another hacker
designed, had made, and distributed posters announcing that said flamer had
been nominated for the `asbestos cork award'. (Any reader in doubt as to the
intended application of the cork should consult the etymology under {flame}.)
Since then, it is agreed that only a select few have risen to the heights of
bombast required to earn this dubious dignity -- but there is no agreement on
_which_ few. :asbestos longjohns: n. Notional garments donned by {Usenet}
posters just before emitting a remark they expect will elicit {flamage}. This
is the most common of the {asbestos} coinages. Also `asbestos underwear',
`asbestos overcoat', etc. :ASCII:: /as'kee/ n. [acronym: American Standard
Code for Information Interchange] The predominant character set encoding of
present-day computers. The modern version uses 7 bits for each character,
whereas most earlier codes (including an early version of
