 :segmentation fault: n. [Unix] 1. [techspeak] An error in which a running
program attempts to access memory not allocated to it and {core dump}s with a
segmentation violation error. This is often caused by improper usage of
pointers in the source code, dereferencing a null pointer, or (in C)
inadvertently using a non-pointer variable as a pointer. The classic example
is: int i; scanf ("%d", i); /* should have used &i */ 2. To lose a train of
thought or a line of reasoning. Also uttered as an exclamation at the point
of befuddlement.
