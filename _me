 :/me: // [IRC; common] Under most IRC, /me is the "pose" command; if you are
logged on as Foonly and type "/me laughs", others watching the channel will
see "* Joe Foonly laughs". This usage has been carried over to mail and news,
where the reader is expected to perform the same expansion in his or her
head.
