 :job security: n. When some piece of code is written in a particularly
{obscure} fashion, and no good reason (such as time or space optimization)
can be discovered, it is often said that the programmer was attempting to
increase his job security (i.e., by making himself indispensable for
maintenance). This sour joke seldom has to be said in full; if two hackers
are looking over some code together and one points at a section and says "job
security", the other one may just nod.
