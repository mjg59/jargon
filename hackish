 HACKISH /hak'ish/ adj. (also HACKISHNESS n.) 1. Being or involving a hack.
2. Of or pertaining to hackers or the hacker subculture. see also
TRUE-HACKER. It is better to be described as hackish by others than to
describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves somewhat of an elite,
though one to which new members are gladly welcome. It is a meritocracy based
on ability. There is a certain self-satisfaction in identifying yourself as a
hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labelled
BOGUS).
