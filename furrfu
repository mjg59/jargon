 :furrfu: // [USENET] excl. Written-only equivalent of "Sheesh!"; it is, in
fact, "sheesh" modified by {rot13}. Evolved in mid-1992 as a response to
notably silly postings repeating urban myths on the USENET newsgroup
alt.folklore.urban, after some posters complained that "Sheesh!" as a
response to {newbie}s was being overused. see also {FOAF}.
