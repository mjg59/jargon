 :bells and whistles: /n./ [by analogy with the toyboxes on theater organs]
Features added to a program or system to make it more {flavorful} from a
hacker's point of view, without necessarily adding to its utility for its
primary function. Distinguished from {chrome}, which is intended to attract
users. "Now that we've got the basic program working, let's go back and add
some bells and whistles." No one seems to know what distinguishes a bell from
a whistle.
