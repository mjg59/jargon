 :bells and whistles: n. [common] Features added to a program or system to

working, let's go back and add some bells and whistles." No one seems to know
what distinguishes a bell from a whistle. The recognized emphatic form is
"bells, whistles, and gongs". It used to be thought that this term derived
from the toyboxes on theater organs. However, the "and gongs" strongly

used bells, whistles, and gongs to signal each other over longer distances
than voice can carry. [73-05-28.png] Sometimes `trouble' is spelled {bells
