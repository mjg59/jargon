 :I see no X here.: Hackers (and the interactive computer games they write)
traditionally favor this slightly marked usage over other possible
equivalents such as "There's no X here!" or "X is missing." or "Where's the
X?". This goes back to the original PDP-10 {ADVENT}, which would respond in
this wise if you asked it to do something involving an object not present at
your location in the game.
