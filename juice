 :juice: n. The weight of a given node in some sort of graph (like a web of
trust or a relevance-weighted search query). This appears to have been
generalized from {google juice}, but may derive from black urban slang for
power or a respect. Example: "I signed your key, but I really don't have the
juice to be authoritative."
