 :fan: /n./ Without qualification, indicates a fan of science fiction,
especially one who goes to {con}s and tends to hang out with other fans. Many
hackers are fans, so this term has been imported from fannish slang; however,
unlike much fannish slang it is recognized by most non-fannish hackers. Among
SF fans the plural is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to
hackers. "Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't really a fan."
