 CTY: /sit'ee/ or /C-T-Y/ n. [MIT] The terminal physically associated with a
computer's system {{console}}. The term is a contraction of `Console {tty}',
that is, `Console TeleTYpe'. This {{ITS}}- and {{TOPS-10}}-associated term
has become less common, as most UNIX hackers simply refer to the CTY as `the
console'. cube: n. 1. [short for `cubicle'] A module in the open-plan offices
used at many programming shops. "I've got the manuals in my cube." 2. A NeXT
machine (which resembles a matte-black cube). cubing: [parallel with
`tubing'] vi. 1. Hacking on an IPSC (Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube.
"Louella's gone cubing *again*!!" 2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles,
either physically or mathematically. 3. An indescribable form of self-torture
(see sense 1 or #2). cursor dipped in X: n. There are a couple of metaphors
in English of the form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common values of X
are `acid', `bile', and `vitriol'). These map over neatly to this hackish
usage (the cursor being what moves, leaving letters behind, when one is
composing on-line). "Talk about a {nastygram}! He must've had his cursor
dipped in acid when he wrote that one!" cuspy: /kuhs'pee/ [WPI: from the DEC
acronym CUSP, for `Commonly Used System Program', i.e., a utility program
used by many people] adj. 1. (of a program) Well-written. 2. Functionally
excellent. A program that performs well and interfaces well to users is
cuspy. see {rude}. 3. [NYU] Said of an attractive woman, especially one
regarded as available. Implies a certain curvaceousness. cut a tape: [poss.
fr. mainstream `cut a check' or from the recording industry's `cut a record']
vi. To write a software or document distribution on magnetic tape for
shipment. Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium! Though this
usage is quite widespread, one never speaks of analogously `cutting a disk'
or anything else in this sense. cybercrud: /si:'ber-kruhd/ [coined by Ted
Nelson] n. Obfuscatory tech-talk. Verbiage with a high {MEGO} factor. The
computer equivalent of bureaucratese. cyberpunk: /si:'ber-puhnk/ [orig. by SF
writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] n.,adj. A subgenre of SF
launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel `Neuromancer' (though
its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's `True Names' (see the Bibliography)
to John Brunner's 1975 novel `The Shockwave Rider'). Gibson's near-total
ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to
speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways
hackers have since found both irritatingly na"ive and tremendously
stimulating. Gibson's work was widely imitated, in particular by the
short-lived but innovative "Max Headroom" TV series. see {cyberspace}, {ice},
{go flatline}. cyberspace: /si:'ber-spays/ n. 1. Notional `information-space'
loaded with visual cues and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called
`cyberspace decks'; a characteristic prop of {cyberpunk} SF. At the time of
this writing (mid-1991), serious efforts to construct {virtual reality}
interfaces modeled explicitly on Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way,
using more conventional devices such as glove sensors and binocular TV
headsets. Few hackers are prepared to deny outright the possibility of a
cyberspace someday evolving out of the network (see {network, the}). 2.
Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the mind of a person in {hack mode}.
Some hackers report experiencing strong eidetic imagery when in hack mode;
interestingly, independent reports from multiple sources suggest that there
are common features to the experience. In particular, the dominant colors of
this subjective `cyberspace' are often gray and silver, and the imagery often
involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting patterns of
lines and angles, or moire patterns. cycle: 1. n. The basic unit of
computation. What every hacker wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper
describes himself as a "cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as
taking so many `clock cycles'. Often the computer can access its memory once
on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory cycles'. These are
technical meanings of {cycle}. The jargon meaning comes from the observation
that there are only so many cycles per second, and when you are sharing a
computer the cycles get divided up among the users. The more cycles the
computer spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the
faster your program will run. That's why every hacker wants more cycles: so
he can spend less time waiting for the computer to respond. 2. By extension,
a notional unit of *human* thought power, emphasizing that lots of things
compete for the typical hacker's think time. "I refused to get involved with
the Rubik's Cube back when it was big. Knew I'd burn too many cycles on it if
I let myself." 3. vt. Syn. {bounce}, {120 reset}; from the phrase `cycle
power'. "Cycle the machine again, that serial port's still hung." cycle
crunch: n. A situation where the number of people trying to use the computer
simultaneously has reached the point where no one can get enough cycles
because they are spread too thin and the system has probably begun to
{thrash}. This is an inevitable result of Parkinson's Law applied to
timesharing. Usually the only solution is to buy more computer. Happily, this
has rapidly become easier in recent years, so much so that the very term
`cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic flavor; most hackers now use
workstations or personal computers as opposed to traditional timesharing
systems. cycle drought: n. A scarcity of cycles. It may be due to a {cycle
crunch}, but it could also occur because part of the computer is temporarily
not working, leaving fewer cycles to go around. "The {high moby} is {down},
so we're running with only half the usual amount of memory. There will be a
cycle drought until it's fixed." cycle of reincarnation: [coined by Ivan
Sutherland ca. 1970] n. Term used to refer to a well-known effect whereby
function in a computing system family is migrated out to special-purpose
peripheral hardware for speed, then the peripheral evolves toward more
computing power as it does its job, then somebody notices that it is
inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors in the architecture and
folds the function back into the main CPU, at which point the cycle begins
again. Several iterations of this cycle have been observed in
graphics-processor design, and at least one or two in communications and
floating-point processors. Also known as `the Wheel of Life', `the Wheel of
Samsara', and other variations of the basic Hindu/Buddhist theological idea.
cycle server: n. A powerful machine that exists primarily for running large
{batch} jobs. Implies that interactive tasks such as editing are done on
other machines on the network, such as workstations. = D = =====
