 :CTY: /sit'ee/ or /C-T-Y/ n. [MIT] The terminal physically associated with a
computer's system {{console}}. The term is a contraction of `Console {tty}',
that is, `Console TeleTYpe'. This {{ITS}}- and {{TOPS-10}}-associated term
has become less common, as most UNIX hackers simply refer to the CTY as `the
console'.
