 CTY /sit'ee/ or /see tee wie/ n. [MIT] The terminal physically associated
with a computer's operating console. The term is a contraction of "Console
TTY", that is, "Console TeleTYpe". This ITS and TOPS-10-associated term has
become less common than formerly, as most UNIX hackers simply refer to the
CTY as `the console'.
