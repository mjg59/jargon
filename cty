 CTY: /sit'ee/ or /see tee wie/ n. [MIT] The terminal physically associated
with a computer's system {{console}}. The term is a contraction of `Console
{tty}', that is, `Console TeleTYpe'. This {ITS}- and {TOPS-10}-associated
term has become less common than formerly, as most UNIX hackers simply refer
to the CTY as `the console'. cube: n. 1. [short for `cubicle'] A module in
the open-plan offices used at many programming shops. "I've got the manuals
in my cube". 2. A NeXT machine. cubing: [parallel with `tubing'] vi. 1.
Hacking on an IPSC (Intel Personal SuperComputer) hypercube. "Louella's gone
cubing *again*!!" 2. Hacking Rubik's Cube or related puzzles, either
physically or mathematically. 3. An indescribable form of self-torture (see
sense #1 or #2). cursor dipped in X: n. There are a couple of metaphors in
English of the form `pen dipped in X' (perhaps the most common values of X
are `acid', `bile' and `vitriol'). These map over neatly to this hackish
usage (the cursor being what moves, leaving letters behind, when one is
composing on-line). cuspy: /kuhs'pee/ [coined at WPI from the DEC acronym
CUSP, for Commonly Used System Program, i.e., a utility program used by many
people] adj. 1. (of a program) Well-written. 2. Functionally excellent. A
program that performs well and interfaces well to users is cuspy. see {rude}.
3. [NYU] Said of an attractive woman, especially one regarded as available.
Implies a certain curvaceousness. cut a tape: [poss. fr. mainstream `cut a
check' or from the recording industry's `cut a record'] vi. To write a
software or document distribution on magnetic tape for shipment. Has nothing
to do with physically cutting the medium! Though this usage is quite
widespread, one never speaks of analogously `cutting a disk' or anything else
in this sense. cybercrud: /sie'ber-kruhd/ [coined by Ted Nelson] n.
Obfuscatory tech-talk. Verbiage with a high {MEGO} factor. The computer
equivalent of bureaucratese. cyberpunk: /sie'ber-puhnk/ [orig. by SF writer
Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] n.,adj. A subgenre of SF launched
in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel `Neuromancer' (though its
roots go back through Vernor Vinge's `True Names' (see Appendix C) to John
Brunner's 1975 novel, `The Shockwave Rider'). Gibson's near-total ignorance
of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate
about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have
since found both irritatingly naive and tremendously stimulating. Gibson's
work was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived but innovative
`Max Headroom' TV series. see {cyberspace}, {ice}, {go flatline}. cyberspace:
/sie'ber-spays/ n. 1. Notional `information-space' loaded with visual cues
and navigable with brain-computer interfaces called `cyberspace decks'; a
characteristic prop of {cyberpunk} SF. At time of writing (mid-1991), serious
efforts to construct {virtual reality} interfaces modelled explicitly on
Gibsonian cyberspace are already under way, using more conventional devices
such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets. Few hackers are prepared to
outright deny the possibility of a cyberspace someday evolving out of the
network (see {network, the}). 2. Occasionally, the metaphoric location of the
mind of a person in {hack mode}. Some hackers report experiencing strong
eidetic imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from
multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the experience. In
particular, the dominant colors of this subjective `cyberspace' are often
gray and silver, and the imagery often involves constellations of marching
dots, elaborate shifting patterns of lines and angles, or moire patterns.
cycle: n. The basic unit of computation. What every hacker wants more of
(noted hacker Bill Gosper used to describe himself as a "cycle junky"). One
might think that single machine instructions would be the measure of
computation, and indeed computers are often compared by how many instructions
they can process per second, but some instructions take longer than others.
Nearly all computers have an internal clock, though, and you can describe an
instruction as taking so many `clock cycles'. Frequently the computer can
access its memory once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of
`memory cycles'. These are technical meanings of {cycle}. The jargon meaning
comes from the observation that there are only so many cycles per second, and
when you are sharing a computer, the cycles get divided up among the users.
The more cycles the computer spends working on your program rather than
someone else's, the faster your program will run. That's why every hacker
wants more cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
respond. cycle crunch: n. The situation where the number of people trying to
use the computer simultaneously has reached the point where no one can get
enough cycles because they are spread too thin. This is an inevitable result
of Parkinson's Law applied to timesharing. Usually the only solution is to
buy more computer. Happily, this has rapidly become easier in recent years,
so much so that the very term `cycle crunch' now has a faintly archaic
flavor; most hackers now use workstations or personal computers as opposed to
traditional timesharing systems. cycle drought: n. A scarcity of cycles. It
may be due to a {cycle crunch}, but could also occur because part of the
computer is temporarily not working, leaving fewer cycles to go around.
Example: "The {high moby} is {down}, so we're running with only half the
usual amount of memory. There will be a cycle drought until it's fixed."
cycle of reincarnation: [coined by Ivan Sutherland ca.1970] n. Term used to
refer to a well-known effect whereby function in a computing system family is
migrated out to special-purpose peripheral hardware for speed, then the
peripheral evolves towards more computing power as it does its job, then
somebody notices that it's inefficient to support two asymmetrical processors
in the architecture and folds the function back into the main CPU, at which
point the cycle begins again. Several iterations of this cycle have been
observed in graphics processor design, and at least one or two in
communications and floating-point processors. Also known as `the Wheel of
Life', `the Wheel of Samsara', and other variations of the basic
Hindu/Buddhist theological idea. cycle server: n. A powerful machine that
exists primarily for running large batch jobs. Implies that interactive tasks
such as editing are done on other machines on the network, such as
workstations. = D = ===== daemon: /day'm*n/ or /dee'm*n/ [from the
mythological meaning, later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution
MONitor'] n. A program which is not invoked explicitly, but which lies
dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. The idea is that the
perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking
(though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it
will implicitly invoke a daemon). For example, under {ITS} writing a file on
the {LPT} spooler's directory would invoke the spooling daemon, which would
then print the file. The advantage is that programs which want (in this
example) files printed need not compete for access to the {LPT}. They simply
enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them.
Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either live
forever or be regenerated at intervals. Usage: daemon and {demon} are often
used interchangeably, but seem to have distinct connotations. The term
`daemon' was introduced to computing by {CTSS} people (who pronounced it
/dee'mon/) and used it to refer to what ITS called a {dragon}. While the
meaning and pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary reflects
current (1991) usage. dangling pointer: n. A reference that doesn't actually
lead anywhere (in C and some other languages, a pointer that doesn't actually
point at anything valid). Usually this is because it formerly pointed to
something which has moved or disappeared. Used as jargon in a generalization
of its techspeak meaning; a local phone number for a person who's since moved
to the other coast, for example. Datamation: n. A magazine that many hackers
assume all {suit}s read. Used to question an unbelieved quote, as in "Did you
read that in Datamation?" It used to publish something hackishly funny every
once in a while, like the original paper on {COME FROM} in 1973; but since
then it's become much more exclusively {suit}-oriented. day mode: n. see
{phase} (sense #1). Used of people only.
