 :smoot: /smoot/ n. [MIT] A unit of length equal five feet seven inches. The
length of the Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus or minus
an ear (the ear stands for {epsilon}). This legend began with a fraternity
prank in 1958 during which the body length of Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was
actually used to measure out that distance. It is commemorated by smoot marks
that MIT students repaint every few years; the tradition even survived the
demolition and rebuilding of the bridge in the late 1980s. The Boston police
have been known to use smoot markers to indicate accident locations on the
bridge.
