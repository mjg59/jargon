 :case and paste: n. [from `cut and paste'] The addition of a new {feature}
to an existing system by selecting the code from an existing feature and
pasting it in with minor changes. Common in telephony circles because most
operations in a telephone switch are selected using case statements. Leads to
{software bloat}. In some circles of EMACS users this is called `programming
by Meta-W', because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of text
to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere. The term is
condescending, implying that the programmer is acting mindlessly rather than
thinking carefully about what is required to integrate the code for two
similar cases. At {DEC} (now HP), this is sometimes called clone-and-hack
coding.
