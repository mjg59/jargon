 MULTICS (muhl'tiks) n. [from Multi-Tasking Computer System] An early (late
1960s) timesharing operating system co-designed by a consortium including
Honeywell and Bell Laboratories. All the members but Honeywell eventually
pulled out after determining that SECOND-SYSTEM SYNDROME had bloated Multics
to the point of practical unusability (though Honeywell did later
comercialize it, it was never very successful). One of the developers left in
the lurch by the project's breakup was Ken Thompson, a circumstance which led
directly to the birth of UNIX (q.v.). For this and other reasons aspects of
the Multics design remain a topic of occasional debate among hackers. see
