 MULTICS /muhl'tiks/ n. [from "MULTiplexed Information and Computing
Service"] An early (late 1960s) timesharing operating system co-designed by a
consortium including MIT, GE and Bell Laboratories, very innovative for its
time (among other things, it introduced the idea of treating all devices
uniformly as special files). All the members but GE eventually pulled out
after determining that SECOND-SYSTEM EFFECT had bloated MULTICS to the point
of practical unusability (the `lean' predecessor in question is said to have
been CTSS, (q.v.)). Honeywell comercialized MULTICS after buying out GE's
computer group, but it was never very successful (amomg other things, one was
required to enter a password to log out). One of the developers left in the
lurch by the project's breakup was Ken Thompson, a circumstance which led
directly to the birth of UNIX (q.v.). For this and other reasons aspects of
the Multics design remain a topic of occasional debate among hackers. see
