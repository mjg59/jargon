 :Multics:: /muhl'tiks/ n. [from "MULTiplexed Information and Computing
Service"] An early (late 1960s) timesharing operating system co-designed by a
consortium including MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories. Very innovative for its
time --- among other things, it introduced the idea of treating all devices
uniformly as special files. All the members but GE eventually pulled out
after determining that {second-system effect} had bloated Multics to the
point of practical unusability (the `lean' predecessor in question was
{CTSS}). Honeywell commercialized Multics after buying out GE's computer
group, but it was never very successful (among other things, on some versions
one was commonly required to enter a password to log out). One of the
developers left in the lurch by the project's breakup was Ken Thompson, a
circumstance which led directly to the birth of {{UNIX}}. For this and other
reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional debate
among hackers. see also {brain-damaged} and {GCOS}.
