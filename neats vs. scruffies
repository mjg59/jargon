 :neats vs. scruffies: n. The label used to refer to one of the continuing
{holy wars} in AI research. This conflict tangles together two separate
issues. One is the relationship between human reasoning and AI; `neats' tend
to try to build systems that `reason' in some way identifiably similar to the
way humans report themselves as doing, while `scruffies' profess not to care
whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the least as long as it
works. More importantly, neats tend to believe that logic is king, while
scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc methods driven by empirical knowledge. To
a neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and
not productive of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a
scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to the
hard-to-capture `common sense' of living intelligences.
