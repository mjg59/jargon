 :brand brand brand: n. Humorous catch-phrase from {BartleMUD}s, in which
players were described carrying a list of objects, the most common of which
would usually be a brand. Often used as a joke in {talk mode} as in "Fred the
wizard is here, carrying brand ruby brand brand brand kettle broadsword
flamethrower". A brand is a torch, of course; one burns up a lot of those
exploring dungeons. Prob. influenced by the famous Monty Python "Spam" skit.
