 CODE POLICE [by analogy with "thought police"] n. A mythical team of
Gestapo-like storm troopers that might burst into one's office and arrest one
for violating style rules. May be used either "seriously" (to underline a
claim that a particular style violation is dangerous) or (more often)
ironically (to suggest that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly
by anal-retentive weenies).
