 CODE POLICE [by analogy with "thought police"] n. A mythical team of
Gestapo-like storm troopers that might burst into one's office and arrest one
for violating style rules. May be used either seriously, to underline a claim
that a particular style violation is dangerous, or ironically, to suggest
that the practice under discussion is condemned mainly by anal-retentive
weenies. The ironic usage is perhaps more common.
