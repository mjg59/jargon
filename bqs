 BQS: /bee-kyoo-ess/ adj. Syn. {Berkeley Quality Software}. brain dump: n.
The act of telling someone everything one knows about a particular topic or
project. Typically used when someone is going to let a new party maintain a
piece of code. Conceptually analogous to an operating system {core dump} in
that it saves a lot of useful {state} before an exit. Example: "You'll have
to give me a brain dump on FOOBAR, before you start your new job at
HackerCorp." see {core dump} (sense #4). At Sun, this is also known as `TOI'
(transfer of information). brain-damaged: [generalization of `Honeywell Brain
Damage' (HBD), a theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter
cretinisms in Honeywell {Multics}] adj. Obviously wrong; {cretinous};
{demented}. There is an implication that the person responsible must have
suffered brain damage, because he should have known better. Calling something
brain-damaged is really bad; it also implies it is unusable, and that its
failure to work is due to poor design rather than some accident. brain-dead:
adj. Brain-damaged in the extreme. Not quite like mainstream use, as it tends
to imply terminal design failure rather than malfunction or simple stupidity.
braino: /bray'no/ n. Syn. for {thinko}. branch to Fishkill: [IBM, from the
location of one of their facilities] n. Any unexpected jump in a program that
produces catastrophic or just plain weird results. see {jump off into
never-never land}, {hyperspace}. brand brand brand: n. Humorous catch-phrase
from {BartleMUD}s, in which players were described carrying a list of
objects, the most common of which would usually be a brand. Often used as a
joke in {talk mode} as in "Fred the wizard is here, carrying brand ruby brand
brand brand kettle broadsword flamethrower". Prob. influenced by the infamous
Monty Python `Spam' skit. break: 1. vt. To cause to be broken (in any sense).
"Your latest patch to the editor broke the paragraph commands." 2. v. (of a
program) To stop temporarily, so that it may debugged. The place where it
stops is a "breakpoint". 3. [techspeak] vi. To send an RS-232 break (125
msec. of line high) over a serial comm line. 4. [UNIX] vi. To strike whatever
key currently causes the tty driver to send SIGINT to the current process.
Normally break (sense 3) or delete does this. breakage: 1. Brokenness and the
consequent mess. 2. [IBM] n. The extra people that must be added to an
organization because its master plan has changed; used esp. of software and
hardware development teams. breath-of-life packet: [XEROX PARC] n. An
Ethernet packet that contained bootstrap code, periodically sent out from a
working computer to infuse the `breath of life' into any computer on the
network that had happened to crash. The machines had hardware or firmware
that would wait for such a packet after a catastrophic error. bring X to its
knees: v. Of a machine, operating system, piece of software, or algorithm; to
present it with a load so extreme or pathological that it grinds virtually to
a halt. "To bring a MicroVAX to its knees, try twenty users running {vi} ---
or four running {EMACS}." Compare {hog}. brittle: adj. Said of software
that's functional but easily broken by changes in operating environment or
configuration, or by any minor tweak to the software itself. Also, any system
which responds inappropriately and disastrously to expected external stimuli,
e.g., a file system that is usually totally scrambled by a power failure is
said to be brittle. This term is often used to describe the results of a
research effort that were never intended to be robust, but can be applied to
commercially developed software. The term `fragile' is sometimes used
synonymously. Oppose {robust}. broadcast storm: n. An incorrect packet
broadcast on a network that causes most hosts to respond all at once,
typically with wrong answers that start the process over again. see {network
meltdown}. broken: adj. 1. Not working properly (of programs). 2. Behaving
strangely; especially, (when used of people) exhibiting extreme depression.
broket: /broh'k*t/ or /broh'ket/ [by analogy with `bracket': a `broken
bracket'] n. Either of the characters `<' and `>', when used as paired
enclosing delimiters. This word originated as a contraction of the phrase
`broken bracket', that is, a bracket that is bent in the middle. (At MIT, and
apparently in the {Real World} as well, these are usually called {angle
brackets}.) Brooks's Law: prov. "Adding manpower to a late software project
makes it later" --- a result of the fact that the advantage from splitting
work between N programmers is O(N), but the complexity and communications
cost associated with coordinating and then merging their work is O(N^2). The
quote is from Fred Brooks, a manager of IBM's OS/360 project and author of
`The Mythical Man-Month' (Addison-Wesley, 1975, ISBN, 0-201-00650-2), an
excellent early book on software engineering; the myth in question has been
most tersely expressed as "Programmer time is fungible", and Brooks
established conclusively that it is not. Hackers have never forgotten his
advice; too often, {management} does.
