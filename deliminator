 :deliminator: /de·lim'·in·ay·t@r/, n. [portmanteau, delimiter + eliminate] A
string or pattern used to delimit text into fields, but which is itself
eliminated from the resulting list of fields. This jargon seems to have
originated among Perl hackers in connection with the Perl split() function;
however, it has been sighted in live use among Java and even Visual Basic
programmers.
