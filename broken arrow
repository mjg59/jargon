 :broken arrow: [IBM] n. The error code displayed on line 25 of a 3270
terminal (or a PC emulating a 3270) for various kinds of protocol violations
and "unexpected" error conditions (including connection to a {down}
computer). On a PC, simulated with `->/_', with the two center characters
overstruck. In true {luser} fashion, the original documentation of these
codes (visible on every 3270 terminal, and necessary for debugging network
problems) was confined to an IBM customer engineering manual. Note: to
appreciate this term fully, it helps to know that `broken arrow' is also
military jargon for an accident involving nuclear weapons....
