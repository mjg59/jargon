 :FRS: Abbreviation for "Freely Redistributable Software" which entered
general use on the Internet in 1995 after years of low-level confusion over
what exactly to call software written to be passed around and shared
(contending terms including {freeware}, {shareware}, "sourceware" were never
univesally felt to be satisfactory for various subtle reasons). The first
formal conference on freely-redistributable software was held in Cambridge,
February 1996 (sponsored by the Free Software Foundation) and used the FRS
abbreviation heavily in its calls for papers and other literature during
1995; this was probably critical in helping establish the term.
