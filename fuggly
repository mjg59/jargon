 :fuggly: /fuhg'lee/ adj. Emphatic form of {funky}; funky + ugly). Unusually
for hacker jargon, this may actually derive from black street-jive. To say it
properly, the first syllable should be growled rather than spoken. Usage:
humorous. "Man, the {{ASCII}}-to-{{EBCDIC}} code in that printer driver is
*fuggly*." see also {wonky}.
