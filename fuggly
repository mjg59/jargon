 FUGGLY (fuhg'lee) adj. Emphatic form of FUNKY; funky + ugly. Unusually for
hacker slang, this may actually derive from black street-jive. To say it
properly, the first syllable should be growled rather than spoken. Usage:
humorous. "Man, the ASCII-to-EBCDIC code in that printer driver is *fuggly*."
see also WONKY.
