 :ELIZA effect: /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ /n./ [AI community] The tendency of humans
to attach associations to terms from prior experience. For example, there is
nothing magic about the symbol `+' that makes it well-suited to indicate
addition; it's just that people associate it with addition. Using `+' or
`plus' to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the
ELIZA effect. This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph
Weizenbaum, which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient. It
worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into
canned phrases. It was so convincing, however, that there are many anecdotes
about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA. All
this was due to people's tendency to attach to words meanings which the
computer never put there. The ELIZA effect is a {Good Thing} when writing a
programming language, but it can blind you to serious shortcomings when
analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system. Compare {ad-hockery}; see also
