 :Vulcan nerve pinch: n. [from the old "Star Trek" TV series via Commodore
Amiga hackers] The keyboard combination that forces a soft-boot or jump to
ROM monitor (on machines that support such a feature). On Amigas this is
<Ctrl>-<Left-Amiga>-<Right-Amiga>; on PC clones this is Ctrl-Alt-Del; on
Suns, L1-A; on Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch> or
<Cmd>-<Ctrl>-<Power>! On IRIX, <Left-Ctrl><Left-Shift><F12><Keypad-Slash>,
which kills and restarts the X server, is sometimes called a vulcan nerve
pinch. Also called {three-finger salute} and `Vulcan death grip'. At shops
with a lot of Microsoft Windows machines, this is often called the `Microsoft
Maneuver' because of the distressing frequency with which Microsoft's
unreliable software requires it. Compare {quadruple bucky}.
