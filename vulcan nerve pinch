 :Vulcan nerve pinch: /n./ [from the old "Star Trek" TV series via Commodore
Amiga hackers] The keyboard combination that forces a soft-boot or jump to
ROM monitor (on machines that support such a feature). On many micros this is
Ctrl-Alt-Del; on Suns, L1-A; on some Macintoshes, it is <Cmd>-<Power switch>!
Also called {three-finger salute}. Compare {quadruple bucky}.
