 :bug-of-the-month club: /n./ A mythical club which users of `sendmail(1)'
(the UNIX mail daemon) belong to; this was coined on the Usenet newsgroup
comp.security.unix at a time when sendmail security holes, which allowed
outside {cracker}s access to the system, were being uncovered at an alarming
rate, forcing sysadmins to update very often. Also, more completely, `fatal
security bug-of-the-month club'.
