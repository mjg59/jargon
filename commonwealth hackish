 :Commonwealth Hackish:: n. Hacker jargon as spoken outside the U.S., esp. in
the British Commonwealth. It is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more
likely to pronounce truncations like `char' and `soc', etc., as spelled
(/char/, /sok/), as opposed to American /keir/ and /sohsh/. Dots in
{newsgroup} names tend to be pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is /sok dot
wib'l/ rather than /sohsh wib'l/). The prefix {meta} may be pronounced
/mee't*/; similarly, Greek letter beta is usually /bee't*/, zeta is usually
/zee't*/, and so forth. Preferred {metasyntactic variable}s include
{blurgle}, `eek', `ook', `frodo', and `bilbo'; `wibble', `wobble', and in
emergencies `wubble'; `banana', `tom', `dick', `harry', `wombat', `frog',
{fish}, and so on and on (see {foo}, sense 4). Alternatives to verb doubling
include suffixes `-o-rama', `frenzy' (as in feeding frenzy), and `city'
(examples: "barf city!" "hack-o-rama!" "core dump frenzy!"). Finally, note
that the American terms `parens', `brackets', and `braces' for (), [], and {}
are uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers `brackets', `square brackets', and
`curly brackets'. Also, the use of `pling' for {bang} is common outside the
United States. see also {attoparsec}, {calculator}, {chemist}, {console
