 COMMONWEALTH HACKISH n. Hacker slang as spoken outside the U.S., esp. in the
British Commonwealth. It is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more
likely to pronounce "char", "soc" etc. as spelled (/char/, /sok/) as opposed
to American /keir/ or /sohsh/. Dots in names tend to be pronounced more often
(/sok dot wi'bble/ rather than /sohsh wib'ble/). Preferred metasyntactic
variables include FRODO and BILBO; WIBBLE, WOBBLE and in emergencies WUBBLE;
BANANA, WOMBAT and FROG and so on and on. Alternatives to verb doubling
include suffixes "-o-rama", "frenzy" (as in feeding frenzy) and "city" (as in
"barf city!" "hack-o-rama!" "core dump frenzy!"). Finally, note that the
American usages `parens' `brackets' and `braces' for (), [], and {} are
uncommon; Commonwealth hackish prefers "bracket", "square bracket" and "curly
bracket". Also, the use of "pling" for BANG is common outside the U.S.. see
