 :script kiddies: pl.n. 1. [very common] The lowest form of {cracker}; script
kiddies do mischief with scripts and programs written by others, often
without understanding the {exploit} they are using. Used of people with
limited technical expertise using easy-to-operate, pre-configured, and/or
automated tools to conduct disruptive activities against networked systems.
Since most of these tools are fairly well-known by the security community,
the adverse impact of such actions is usually minimal. 2. People who cannot
program, but who create tacky HTML pages by copying JavaScript routines from
other tacky HTML pages. More generally, a script kiddie writes (or more
likely cuts and pastes) code without either having or desiring to have a
mental model of what the code does; someone who thinks of code as magical
incantations and asks only "what do I need to type to make this happen?"
