 :feeping creaturism: /fee'ping kree`ch*r-izm/ n. A deliberate spoonerism for
{creeping featurism}, meant to imply that the system or program in question
has become a misshapen creature of hacks. This term isn't really well
defined, but it sounds so neat that most hackers have said or heard it. It is
probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about in the dark
making their customary noises.
