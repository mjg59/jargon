 :milliLampson: /mil'*-lamp`sn/ n. A unit of talking speed, abbreviated mL.
Most people run about 200 milliLampsons. Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and
systems implementor highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000. A few people
speak faster. This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes widely
disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and actually emit them in
speech. For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell (designer of the
PDP-11) is said, with some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at
about 300; he is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth
tries to keep up with his speeding brain.
