 :TAN: adj. [Usenet, particularly rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan] Abbrev.
of `tangent', as in "off on a tangent", and synonym for {OT}. A number of
hacker-humor synonyms are used for TAN in some newsgroups. Instances such as
BEIGE, OFF-WHITE, BROWNISH-GRAY, and LIGHT BROWN have been observed. It is
generally understood on newsgroups with this convention that any color
descriptor is a TAN synonym if (a) used as the first word(s) of the topic of
a Usenet post, (b) written in ALL CAPS, and (c) followed immediately by a
colon. Usage: "OFF-WHITE: 2000 Presidential candidates" on an SF newsgroup.
