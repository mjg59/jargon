 :If you want X, you know where to find it.: There is a legend that Dennis
Ritchie, inventor of {C}, once responded to demands for features resembling
those of what at the time was a much more popular language by observing "If
you want PL/1, you know where to find it." Ever since, this has been hackish
standard form for fending off requests to alter a new design to mimic some
older (and, by implication, inferior and {baroque}) one. The case X =
{Pascal} manifests semi-regularly on USENET's comp.lang.c newsgroup. Indeed,
the case X = X has been reported in discussions of graphics software (see
{X}).
