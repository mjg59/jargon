 :nasal demons: n. During a discussion on the USENET group comp.std.c in
early 1992, a regular remarked "When the compiler encounters [a given
undefined construct] it is legal for it to make demons fly out of your nose"
(the implication is that it may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to
interpret the code without violating the ANSI C standard). Someone else
followed up with a reference to "nasal demons", which became recognized
shorthand on that group for any unexpected behaviour of a C compiler on
encountering an undefined construct.
