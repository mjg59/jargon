 :nasal demons: n. Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group comp.std.c for
any unexpected behavior of a C compiler on encountering an undefined
construct. During a discussion on that group in early 1992, a regular
remarked "When the compiler encounters [a given undefined construct] it is
legal for it to make demons fly out of your nose" (the implication is that
the compiler may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret the code
without violating the ANSI C standard). Someone else followed up with a
reference to "nasal demons", which quickly became established. The original
