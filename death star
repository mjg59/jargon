 :Death Star: n. [from the movie Star Wars] 1. The AT&T corporate logo, which
bears an uncanny resemblance to the Death Star in the Star Wars movies. This
usage was particularly common among partisans of {BSD} Unix in the 1980s, who
tended to regard the AT&T versions as inferior and AT&T as a bad guy. Copies
still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu showing a starscape with a
space fighter labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from a broken AT&T logo wreathed
in flames. 2. AT&T's internal magazine, Focus, uses death star to describe an
incorrectly done AT&T logo in which the inner circle in the top left is dark
instead of light -- a frequent result of dark-on-light logo images. 3. The
IBM DeskStar 75GXP drive series, which suffered manufacturing problems and
had an uncanny ability to die after a few months in the field. This drive
series single-handedly destroyed IBM's previously very good reputation in the
hard disk market, and ended up with IBM selling their hard disk business to
Hitachi.
