 :Death Star: /n./ [from the movie "Star Wars"] 1. The AT&T corporate logo,
which appears on computers sold by AT&T and bears an uncanny resemblance to
the Death Star in the movie. This usage is particularly common among
partisans of {BSD} Unix, who tend to regard the AT&T versions as inferior and
AT&T as a bad guy. Copies still circulate of a poster printed by Mt. Xinu
showing a starscape with a space fighter labeled 4.2 BSD streaking away from
a broken AT&T logo wreathed in flames. 2. AT&T's internal magazine, "Focus",
uses `death star' to describe an incorrectly done AT&T logo in which the
inner circle in the top left is dark instead of light -- a frequent result of
dark-on-light logo images.
