 DEATH STAR [from the movie _Star_Wars_] The AT&T corporate logo, which
appears on computers sold by AT&T and bears an uncanny resemblence to the
"Death Star" in the movie. This usage is particularly common among partisans
of BSD UNIX, who tend to regard the AT&T versions as inferior and AT&T as a
bad guy.
