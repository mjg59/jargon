 :say: vt. 1. To type to a terminal. "To list a directory verbosely, you have
to say `ls -l'." Tends to imply a {newline}-terminated command (a
`sentence'). 2. A computer may also be said to `say' things to you, even if
it doesn't have a speech synthesizer, by displaying them on a terminal in
response to your commands. Hackers find it odd that this usage confuses
{mundane}s.
