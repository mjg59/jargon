 :robot: [IRC, MUD] n. An {IRC} or {MUD} user who is actually a program. On
IRC, typically the robot provides some useful service. Examples are NickServ,
which tries to prevent random users from adopting {nick}s already claimed by
others, and MsgServ, which allows one to send asynchronous messages to be
delivered when the recipient signs on. Also common are "annoybots", such as
KissServ, which perform no useful function except to send cute messages to
other people. Service robots are less common on MUDs; but some others, such
as the `Julia' robot active in 1990--91, have been remarkably impressive
Turing-test experiments, able to pass as human for as long as ten or fifteen
minutes of conversation.
