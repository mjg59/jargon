 :cruft: /kruhft/ [back-formation from {crufty}] 1. /n./ An unpleasant
substance. The dust that gathers under your bed is cruft; the TMRC Dictionary
correctly noted that attacking it with a broom only produces more. 2. /n./
The results of shoddy construction. 3. /vt./ [from `hand cruft', pun on `hand
craft'] To write assembler code for something normally (and better) done by a
compiler (see {hand-hacking}). 4. /n./ Excess; superfluous junk; used esp. of
redundant or superseded code. 5. [University of Wisconsin] /n./ Cruft is to
hackers as gaggle is to geese; that is, at UW one properly says "a cruft of
hackers". This term is one of the oldest in the jargon and no one is sure of
its etymology, but it is suggestive that there is a Cruft Hall at Harvard
University which is part of the old physics building; it's said to have been
the physics department's radar lab during WWII. To this day (early 1993) the
windows appear to be full of random techno-junk. MIT or Lincoln Labs people
may well have coined the term as a knock on the competition.
