 :walking drives: n. An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk drives back
in the days when they were huge, clunky {washing machine}s. Those old
{dinosaur} parts carried terrific angular momentum; the combination of a
misaligned spindle or worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with the
floor could cause them to `walk' across a room, lurching alternate corners
forward a couple of millimeters at a time. There is a legend about a drive
that walked over to the only door to the computer room and jammed it shut;
the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at it! Walking could
also be induced by certain patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the
whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other direction).
Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing
patterns that would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive
races.
