 WALKING DRIVES (wahk'ing drievz) An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk
drives back in the days when they were 14" wide WASHING MACHINES. Those old
DINOSAURS carried terrific angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned
spindle or worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could
cause them to "walk" across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a
couple of millimeters at a time. This could also be induced by certain
patterns of drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk,
followed by a slow seek in the other direction). It is known that some bands
of old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns that
would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive races. This is
not a joke!
