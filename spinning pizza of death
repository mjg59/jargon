 :Spinning Pizza of Death: n. [OS X; common] The quartered-circle busy
indicator on Mac OS X versions before 10.2, after which it was replaced by a
sort of rainbow pinwheel thingy. It was analogous to the Microsoft Windows
hourglass, but OS X 10.0's legendary slowness under the Aqua toolkit made
this term rather more evocative. see {Death, X of}.
