 :virtual: adj. [via the technical term virtual memory, prob.: from the term
virtual image in optics] 1. Common alternative to {logical}; often used to
refer to the artificial objects (like addressable virtual memory larger than
physical memory) simulated by a computer system as a convenient way to manage
access to shared resources. 2. Simulated; performing the functions of
something that isn't really there. An imaginative child's doll may be a
virtual playmate. Oppose {real}.
