 :virtual: adj. [via the technical term `virtual memory', prob. from the term
`virtual image' in optics] 1. Common alternative to {logical}; often used to
refer to the artificial objects (like addressable virtual memory larger than
physical memory) created by a computer system to help the system control
access to shared resources. 2. Simulated; performing the functions of
something that isn't really there. An imaginative child's doll may be a
virtual playmate. Oppose {real}.
