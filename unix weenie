 :Unix weenie: /n./ [ITS] 1. A derogatory play on `Unix wizard', common among
hackers who use Unix by necessity but would prefer alternatives. The
implication is that although the person in question may consider mastery of
Unix arcana to be a wizardly skill, the only real skill involved is the
ability to tolerate (and the bad taste to wallow in) the incoherence and
needless complexity that is alleged to infest many Unix programs. "This shell
script tries to parse its arguments in 69 bletcherous ways. It must have been
written by a real Unix weenie." 2. A derogatory term for anyone who engages
in uncritical praise of Unix. Often appearing in the context "stupid Unix
weenie". see {Weenix}, {Unix conspiracy}. see also {weenie}.
