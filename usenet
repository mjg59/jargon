 :USENET: /yoos'net/ or /yooz'net/ [from `Users' Network'] n. A distributed
{bboard} (bulletin board) system supported mainly by UNIX machines.
Originally implemented in 1979-1980 by Steve Bellovin, Jim Ellis, Tom
Truscott, and Steve Daniel at Duke University, it has swiftly grown to become
international in scope and is now probably the largest decentralized
information utility in existence. As of early 1991, it hosts well over 700
{newsgroup}s and an average of 16 megabytes (the equivalent of several
thousand paper pages) of new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter,
and {flamage} every day.
