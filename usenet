 :Usenet: /yoos´net/, /yooz´net/, n. [from `Users' Network'; the original
spelling was USENET, but the mixed-case form is now widely preferred] A
distributed {bboard} (bulletin board) system supported mainly by Unix
machines. Originally implemented in 1979--1980 by Steve Bellovin, Jim Ellis,
Tom Truscott, and Steve Daniel at Duke University and the University of North
Carolina, it has swiftly grown to become international in scope and is now
probably the largest decentralized information utility in existence. As of
late 2002, it hosts over 100,000 {newsgroup}s and an unguessably huge volume
of new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter, and {flamage} every day
(and that leaves out the graphics...). By the year the Internet hit the
mainstream (1994) the original UUCP transport for Usenet was fading out of
use -- almost all Usenet connections were over Internet links. A lot of
newbies and journalists began to refer to "Internet newsgroups" as though
Usenet was and always had been just another Internet service. This ignorance
greatly annoys experienced Usenetters.
