 USENET: /yoos'net/ or /yooz'net/ [from `Users' Network'] n. A distributed
{bboard} (bulletin board) system supported mainly by UNIX machines,
international in scope and probably the largest anarchic information utility
in existence. As of early 1991, it hosts well over 700 {newsgroup}s and an
average of 16 megabytes (the equivalent of several thousand paper pages) of
new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter, and {flamage} every day.
user: n. 1. Someone doing `real work' with the computer, who uses a computer
as a means rather than an end. Someone who pays to use a computer. see {real
user}. 2. A programmer who will believe anything you tell him. One who asks
silly questions. [GLS observes: This is slightly unfair. It is true that
users ask questions (of necessity). Sometimes they are thoughtful or deep.
Very often they are annoying or downright stupid, apparently because the user
failed to think for two seconds or look in the documentation before bothering
the maintainer.] see {luser}. 3. Someone who uses a program from the outside,
however skillfully, without getting into the internals of the program. One
who reports bugs instead of just going ahead and fixing them. The general
theory behind this term is that there are two classes of people who work with
a program: there are implementors (hackers) and {luser}s. The users are
looked down on by hackers to a mild degree because they don't understand the
full ramifications of the system in all its glory. (The few users who do are
known as `real winner's.) The term is a relative one: a skilled hacker may be
a user with respect to some program he himself does not hack. A LISP hacker
might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses LISP (but with the skill of a
hacker). A LISP user is one who uses LISP, whether skillfully or not. Thus
there is some overlap between the two terms; the subtle distinctions must be
resolved by context. user-friendly: adj. Programmer-hostile. Generally used
by hackers in a critical tone, to describe systems which hold the user's hand
so obsessively that they make it painful for the more experienced and
knowledgeable to get any work done. see {menuitis}, {drool-proof paper},
{Macintrash}, {user-obsequious}. user-obsequious: adj. Emphatic form of
{user-friendly}. Connotes a system so verbose, inflexible, and determinedly
simple-minded that it is nearly unusable. "Design a system any fool can use
and only a fool will want to use it." see {WIMP environment}, {Macintrash}.
