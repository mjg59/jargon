 :Usenet: /yoos'net/ or /yooz'net/ /n./ [from `Users' Network'; the original
spelling was USENET, but the mixed-case form is now widely preferred] A
distributed {bboard} (bulletin board) system supported mainly by Unix
machines. Originally implemented in 1979--1980 by Steve Bellovin, Jim Ellis,
Tom Truscott, and Steve Daniel at Duke University, it has swiftly grown to
become international in scope and is now probably the largest decentralized
information utility in existence. As of early 1996, it hosts over 10,000
{newsgroup}s and an average of over 500 megabytes (the equivalent of several
thousand paper pages) of new technical articles, news, discussion, chatter,
and {flamage} every day.
