 :perfect programmer syndrome: /n./ Arrogance; the egotistical conviction
that one is above normal human error. Most frequently found among programmers
of some native ability but relatively little experience (especially new
graduates; their perceptions may be distorted by a history of excellent
performance at solving {toy problem}s). "Of course my program is correct,
there is no need to test it." "Yes, I can see there may be a problem here,
but *I'll* never type `rm -r /' while in {root mode}."
