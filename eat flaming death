 :eat flaming death: /imp./ A construction popularized among hackers by the
infamous {CPU Wars} comic; supposedly derive from a famously turgid line in a
WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic that ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan
mongrels!" or something of the sort (however, it is also reported that the
Firesign Theater's 1975 album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own"
included the phrase "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs"; this may have
been an influence). Used in humorously overblown expressions of hostility.
"Eat flaming death, {{EBCDIC}} users!"
