 EAT FLAMING DEATH, X! expl. A construction popularized among hackers by the
infamous DEC WARS comic (q.v.); supposed to derive from a famously turgid
line in a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic in which X was "non-Aryan
mongrels" or something of the sort. Used in humorously overblown expressions
of hostility. "Eat flaming death, EBCDIC users!"
