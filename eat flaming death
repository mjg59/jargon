 :eat flaming death: imp. A construction popularized among hackers by the
infamous {CPU Wars} comic; supposedly derived from a famously turgid line in
a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic that ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan
mongrels!" or something of the sort (however, it is also reported that on the
the Firesign Theatre's 1975 album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own" a
character won the right to scream "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs" in
the middle of Oscar night on a game show; this may have been an influence).
Used in humorously overblown expressions of hostility. "Eat flaming death,
{{EBCDIC}} users!"
