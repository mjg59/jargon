 :spawn: n.,vi. 1. [techspeak] In Unix parlance, to create a child process
from within a process. Technically this is a `fork'; the term `spawn' is a
bit more general and is used for threads (lightweight processes) as well as
traditional heavyweight processes. 2. In gaming, meant to indicate where
(spawn-point) and when a player comes to life (or re-spawns) after being
killed. Opposite of {frag}.
