 :C++: /C'-pluhs-pluhs/ /n./ Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Labs
as a successor to {C}. Now one of the {languages of choice}, although many
hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68 or {Ada}
(depending on generation), and a prime example of {second-system effect}.
Almost anything that can be done in any language can be done in C++, but it
requires a {language lawyer} to know what is and what is not legal-- the
design is *almost* too large to hold in even hackers' heads. Much of the
{cruft} results from C++'s attempt to be backward compatible with C.
Stroustrup himself has said in his retrospective book "The Design and
Evolution of C++" (p. 207), "Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner
language struggling to get out." [Many hackers would now add "Yes, and it's
called Java" --ESR]
