 :whack: v. According to arch-hacker James Gosling (designer oof {NeWS} and
{GOSMACS}), to "...modify a program with no idea whatsoever how it works."
(see {whacker}.) It is actually possible to do this in nontrivial
circumstances if the change is small and well-defined and you are very good
at {glark}ing things from context. As a trivial example, it is relatively
easy to change all `stderr' writes to `stdout' writes in a piece of C filter
code which remains otherwise mysterious.
