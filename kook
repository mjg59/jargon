 :kook: [Usenet; originally and more formally, `net.kook'] Term used to
describe a regular poster who continually posts messages with no apparent
grounding in reality. Different from a {troll}, which implies a sort of sly
wink on the part of a poster who knows better, kooks really believe what they
write, to the extent that they believe anything. The kook trademark is
paranoia and grandiosity. Kooks will often build up elaborate imaginary
support structures, fake corporations and the like, and continue to act as if
those things are real even after their falsity has been documented in public.
While they may appear harmless, and are usually filtered out by the other
regular participants in a newsgroup of mailing list, they can still cause
problems because the necessity for these measures is not immediately apparent
to newcomers; there are several instances on record, for example, of
journalists writing stories with quotes from kooks who caught them unaware.
