 :hidden flag: [scientific computation] n. An extra option added to a routine
without changing the calling sequence. For example, instead of adding an
explicit input variable to instruct a routine to give extra diagnostic
output, the programmer might just add a test for some otherwise meaningless
feature of the existing inputs, such as a negative mass. Liberal use of
hidden flags can make a program very hard to debug and understand.
